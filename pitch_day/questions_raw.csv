0,sarah825,1,"Due to past experience, I’m pretty sure I got my candida from an Overexposure to chemicals over a period of time. I read about doing a metal detox at the beginning of the diet, has anyone ever done this?"
1,Wiley200,1,"Some people do a heavy metal detox, including some chelation. You have to be very careful with chelation though, as doing it too quickly can lead to some serious health problems.You would probably need some professional advice to do that.I would focus on improving your diet etc first, and try to get your immune system back on track. If you hit a plateau, then maybe you can get tested for heavy metals."
2,PeteSake,1,"Diatomaceous earth is believed to be good at detoxing heavy metals, as well as killing parasites and some sources say it kills Candida.I’ve used it religiously and can attest to the parasite killing effects, as you can see dead -sites in the stool, but haven’t tested for heavy metals as of yet.I will say that it is dehydrating so water intake would need to be upped, and breathing it can be hazardous if it gets to your lungs so it should be extensively researched before taken up.All in all it has helped my candida treatment overall. And it gives tons of energy!"
3,LadyCandiKiller,1,"I’d like to offer a suggestion. Please research diatomaceous earth (food grade) for getting rid of candida. It is awesome stuff! All you need to do is google it for information. There are tons of reports saying that it works. Here is what one natural healer had to say.“After working with hundreds of clients and many years of trial and error, we have finally figured out the best concoction for killing candida: (there are a couple of other suggestions as well) Food-grade diatomaceous earth, these old tiny fossils don’t harm the human body, but act like razor blades to the exoskeleton of the candida.” From The Whole Journey . comI use it regularly, without hesitation. It is so helpful with many things including candida. Again, research, research, research."
4,WhiteTrash,1,Is Diatomaceous Earth completely side effect free?
0,doublek,2,"I’ve seen it come up a couple times here in old posts, but this is something that hasn’t been discussed much. I started taking copper about a month ago and really believe that it has helped me a lot. Why? Copper retards yeast growth. In fact, several websites I’ve read suggest that a copper imbalance may actually be on of the main reasons candida spreads.When I started taking copper, I had been taking zinc for a while to help boost my immune system. That was a mistake, not that there is anything wrong with zinc, but copper and zinc should be taken together in the proper proportion, at a 8:1 ratio. So since I was taking 20mg of zinc, I started taking 2.5mg of copper. When I first started taking copper I had horrible die-off symptoms that lasted about a week and a half, but since then things have really improved.Based on my own experience, I would highly recommend copper. I would like to know if anyone else has tried copper and if it helped you."
0,danjeckstein,3,"Hello everyone. Quick back story: I lived with toxic mold for a year and a half. I’m having a lot of the symptoms and have researched Candida. I’ve read the book and am planning on starting the diet after the holidays. I’ve already cut out a lot of the foods that are not on the diet but like I said, I’m not starting until Jan 1. Lately when I smoke weed my breathing gets very short and I can’t stop coughing. I know that marijuana sensitivity is a symptom. What I would like to know is: Can I treat Candida Overgrowth while still smoking weed? I have tried to vape but it causes the same reaction. Never had a problem with weed until the mold exposure. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks, Dan"
1,raster,3,"You likely have high histamine levels. If you take a break for a period of time and take care of yourself, the reactions should get less bad from my experience. I would then switch to a vape. Take vitamin C to reduce histamine levels. -raster"
2,futureyogi,3,"I just had a horrible reaction to marijuana last night. It was like a seizure. I started taking a bunch of anti fungals yesterdays so I guess my liver was already taxed and couldnt process the weed. I know weed is supposed to be good for you but it still has to be processed by the liver (I guess its the thc). I have had this candida problem for a while now and what Ive learned is that yeast releases toxins in your body. One of them resembles alcohol (which makes you crave sugar). So you already have to process toxins and then your putting more chemicals into your body when you do drugs. Smoking mary j while having candida might be ok, as long as your not going through a cleanse and trying to eradicate it. Its really best to avoid it. I know I will be for a while. Hope you get better!"
3,Sanshou,3,"I turned into a heavy user after getting pneumonia, which was mostly caused by cigarettes. But it cleared after about a week of smoking cannabis with a water pipe to filter the smoke. In the last year I’ve also started making tinctures with the leaf. Which has turned into my new cough syrup or when I need something to knock me out.It has been a wonder for helping with sleep and it helped get me through a lot of the blow back from this illness like my broken rib or fibromyalgia, etc. It does have it’s draw backs, but I think the benefits like cannabinoids out weigh the drawbacks. As cannabinoids may play a role in helping people like us to heal. Because if you follow the functions of cannabinoids you see their role is most often to aid other substances “like medicines” to function more efficiently with the immune system. They also have other benefits like being anti-cancer etc, but so do a lot of other substances like herbs, they just lack cannabinoids like traditional medicines.A lot of this in conjecture to a point, but I’m sure most of use have read some of the things said about cannabis and other herbs by now, so it’s likely some of it may be true. As for my personal experience it’s been a big help, even if I feel I currently use a little too much, using it nightly."
4,Yuki,3,"I agree with raster. A break while you heal and then starting back up with a vape is probably your best bet. If you absolutely do not want a break, at least get a vape to give your lungs a break!Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)"
5,rmw1822,3,"I’m no doctor, but I think you can. I’ve struggled with candida for almost 3 years now and I’ve never had any issues using marijuana while on the diet. I think its positives definitely outweigh its negatives when on the diet due to the stress some people may have on the diet alone, the social difficulties (if you’re a drinker), etc. I’m naturally a stressed out person (thanks Mom!) so again, I think being able to relax and not think so much reduces my stress which is probably part of the reason I’m struggling with candida overgrowth to begin with. The only think you have to be careful with is the munchies!"
6,Chrysanthos,3,Is it true that marijuana can actually help to loss weight? I’ve been hearing people talk about this lately in some forum i cant remember what forum that is but i was pretty curious about they’re topic. I have been reading this marijuana strain here in [LINK REMOVED] and all it says that it can help you relax and chill you physically and mentally. Some of them might even help you with depression and anxiety but this issue regarding losing weight when using marijuana is just fascinating. Can you enlighten me with some new information about this?
0,ibeatthebeast,4,"Please listen to what I have to say. I am a 28 year old male and was plagued by systemic candida for over 4 years. I was finally able to heal myself once I followed the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the practice of curing a damp gut. One thing you must understand is that to treat the root cause of the infection means healing the internal organs (specifically the spleen, kidneys, and liver). You need to avoid ALL damp-forming foods including all forms of dairy, all sugar/honey/artificial sweeteners, give up all caffeine, and eat plenty of warm, drying foods including sweet potatoes, azuki beans, barley, celery, ginger, turmeric, cumin, lemon/lime juice, plenty of water (between meals only), cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, etc. These should be the staples of your diet. Don’t obsess about carbohydrates associated with these foods as I first did. Think about the bigger picture, not just Western medicine’s obsession of treating symptoms. Try it, you will see amazing results.1 user thanked author for this post.  LadyCandiKiller"
1,LadyCandiKiller,4,"You said “drying foods including sweet potatoes, azuki beans, barley, celery, ginger, turmeric, cumin, lemon/lime juice, plenty of water (between meals only), cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, etc.”My question is what is the “etc.”?"

3,JoeR,5,"Make sure its does not contain any sugar, plain yogurt with living probiotics."
4,critzker,5,Sounds like hypothyroid! Those with Candida are super susceptible to hypothyroid!
0,dg,6,"Hi there,I found out I had Candida after insane itching at night and on my bottom. My diet has been high in carbs and sugar for the last 6 months (+ stress), which definitely put me over the edge. I started the diet 2 or so weeks ago, just started antifungals and probiotics. My die-off symptoms (if they are die-off symptoms) are insane. I am completely up and down with my moods, to the point where it’s affecting my relationship with my mom whom I’m currently living with. I start a new job and MOVE in 2 weeks and will be going on international trips shortly thereafter. I literally cannot function and I need to be able to to live my life. I’m in bed, constantly, because I’m so weak. My stomach is making all kinds of weird sounds and I am craving carbs and a not-so-regimented diet. This is making me incredibly depressed, and I already struggle with depression as it is. When will this stop and when will it go away and how can I make these symptoms lessen? Is there anything I can do?Sorry for the intense message but I literally don’t know where to go about this. Any and all help and support would be so appreciated.d"
1,Wiley200,6,"The anal itching is likely from digestive problems. Buy some anti-itch cream to reduce the symptoms, or try coconut oil at night.You should avoid anything that will irritate your stomach/gut in the short term. That means cutting down on coffee, spicy food, etc.Reduce your use of probiotics and antifungals for a while. Focus on the diet instead and allow yourself to get used to that first. You’re meant to introduce those (and the diet) using a staggered approach to avoid irritating your liver and GI tract. Sounds like you’ve done too much too fast!!"
2,dg,6,"The anal itching has stopped since starting the diet, so we’re good there.I’ve cut down on coffee from literally 4 cups to 1. That’s hard enough – I can’t cut out anymore based on my lifestyle at this point.Why would I use a staggered approach if I just want it out of me? And if I do, does that mean I can still eat some carbs and some sugars alongside the diet and just reduce them gradually? I’ve literally cut them out completely and my body is clearly not reacting well. It is in complete shock and my brain is completely out of wack. I don’t know what to do."
3,user5511,6,"You say you will start in the job just 2 weeks from now? So while you can stay at home before starting there, I would advise to make a cold-turkey fasting. Make your last meal the dinner, and after waking up in the next day you start your fasting. It’s much easier to do it this way since the many hours you don’t eat while you’re asleep will reduce the cravings for food significantly. Up to 3rd day it will be tough the cravings, resist it. Day 3 onwards much easier. When I fasted, I consumed coffee normally, and also good since a cup of coffee consists of more than 90% water, it will not affect your progress, just be careful with the amount of sugar you drink with it. Fasting is the only measure that will allow for the quickest results. Sleep a lot, sex, netflix, whatever keeps your head from thinking on food Lol"
4,JoeR,6,"I recommend you fully cut caffiene, my candida come back at alarming rate when i took a coffee at my first recover and my symptoms going worse."
5,Vita,6,"Up your vit c dose. That got rid of my die off symptoms completely. Granted I took a very high dose of vit c and continued to do it for a month while killing the candida. You can check my story on how I got rid of my candida on the forum.Also take something to alkalize your body. A greens powder like chlorella or some other mix. The more alkaline you are the more shimmy room you have for cheat days and really stressful days. They won’t hit you as hard and you won’t have as big of a flare up if any.Instead of fasting switch to smoothies.Grab a plant based protein and add fruits low in sweetness (Like 1/2 a banana ). In the beginning due to my lifestyle I would simply have a smoothie for breakfast and lunch and a meal for dinner. The liquid diet not only supplies you with nutrients, keeps you full, but also gives you strength to still function. It lessens the burden on your digestive system. If you can juice too, I just didn’t have that much time for it.Make sure you get a good liver supplement to. Whether it’s glutathion or even milk thistle, it will give you a huge boost. You can customize your smoothies to give you the energy you need with minimal digestion problems. I’d often add some adaptogens like ashwaghanda for an added boost."
6,Fawzi,6,"I have read many articles about medical marijuana and how it can help you in terms of chronic pain, bone injuries, eating disorder/anorexia, anxiety disorders and panic attacks, inflammation, even cancer and a lot more. Like this article about a marijuana strain from [LINK REMOVED] . Cbd and thc are also new to me and I don’t even smoke. If this is true I cant find any solid conclusive evidence that speaks to its efficacy."

0,Vegan Catlady,7,I wanted to start a thread for those who have found relief and are near their cure- What five things would you tell a new person to the forum that is overwhelmed with the info and would like advice based on your successes and mistakes?
1,Tdog333,7,"1. Diet won’t cure you, find the underlying cause and fix it. Candida is a opportunistic microbe, it wont go crazy unless something goes wrong in your body. 2. Don’t cut out sugar or carbs, but don’t overdo sugar. Cutting out carbs may help for a couple of months, but once candida adapts to fats it will become impossible to kill it while in ketosis. The trick is to cut back on foods that are toxic or create a heavier burden on your body, while still providing adequate nutrition. 3. Don’t believe everything someone else on the internet says, do your own research to confirm what they say is true. Don’t believe anyone who tells you that they cured themselves only by taking one miracle anti-fungal, they want your money. 4. The most common underlying cause of chronic candida is a suppressed immune system. Some causes are mercury and heavy metals, methylation(genetic) issues, accutane and ongoing abx usage, crippled gut flora, hypochlorhydria, and some others I’m forgetting and will add later. 5. Get the proper testing, a stool test is good but you need more than that. Get a 23andme test, organic acids test, nutreval(if you have the money), and other important tests. Candida testing is really hit or miss so don’t put your faith in the results."
2,Vegan Catlady,7,"1. You dont have to have a major life-threatening disease to get candida overgrowth…anywhere. I have it in my throat/esophagus. I was told over and over that only people with HIV and Hepatitis get that. That is not true. 2. Experiment with supplements and antifungals, but the biggest thing to make candida go away faster is stress-reduction and adrenal support. They go hand-in-hand. Wish I started that earlier. 3. There isnt only one way to do this. There are many. I eat fruit, I omit all dairy/meat/eggs for almost 3 years and have no deficiencies or health problems related to my diet. I have blood-tests twice a year every year just because I enjoy showing my worried relatives, but even my B-12 is better than most. No one gets undernourished eating only veggies and fruit. Otherwise, Id me near dead by now. 4. Using kits and taking pills may feel pro-active, but it is possible to handle candida overgrowth without them. They may be well-tolerated and have good reviews, but if they were absolutely critical to recovery, no one would be on the forum and traditional MDs would get-in on the cash-flow. We would all be cured. 5. Do your own research. Lots of it. When someone tells you that one way is the right way, google opposing views. Look at it from all angles. People (including a few doctors)are very well-meaning, but your health is your responsibility. Question even the doctors."
3,EasternRay,7,"I see a lot of people confused by the contradicting information and theories on Candida treatments. I think that’s the number one problem. If you agree, give me a comment.Interesting views on this thread.But, if I could ask a Candida newbie or a person who has been struggling with different approaches for a while with little results (or none, or even worse results!), I would ask this:What is the No.1 thing that will take you from your situation to where you want to be? What will help you the most?I’d appreciate feedback on this. Thanks."

You heal so much faster with better sleep but most of us work full time. The second for me would be money. If I had more money I would get more testing done and learn more intricate details about my body and address those as well.-raster"
5,EasternRay,7,"Yes, Raster, sleep is essential for healing any illness. And money are also necessary. Regarding the information or methods/approaches to healing candida, would you be needing something to help you heal faster?"

8,laurenziano,7,#1 yeast is the #1 source of Candida yeast infection -Candida yeast infection means exactly that yeast is the infection. Same as vaginal yeast infection is the yeast. I can’t. Eat yeast bread – yeast pizza-yeast submarine sandwiches anymore the yeast makes me vomit. I used to love that stuff. DIAHRREA 15 times a day made me stop yeast for good. Stopped yeast and diahrrea never came back for months. I got yeast overgrowth because I drank lots of tonic water with quinine. I got quinine poisoning. Quinine is used in south America to kill rats same as arsenic. Quinine explodes your blood vessels and ruins your immune system and yeast comes charging taking over your body. The post here about poison metals breaking down your immune system is right on. He knows what he’s. Talking about. Good advice. Hard to find good advice. Stop yeast it’s the cause of every disease on earth”DO NOT EAT LEAVENED BREAD FROM THE ONE WHO CREATED BREAD.
9,laurenziano,7,You need to find someone who specializes in yeast overgrowth cures. Physicians don’t have the high powered microscopes to detect yeast infections. Blood tests don’t. Show yeast infections. They say you don’t have a yeast infection and send you home. Trouble is yeast is making you sick. Until you take a yeast test you will never find what’s wrong with you. 1.7 billion people they say have yeast infections in the world. What do they all have in common-they all eat yeast bread every day.
10,ibeatthebeast,7,"Please listen to what I have to say. I completely understand how you feel as I was plagued by systemic candida for over 4 years.

11,RiversTrini,7,"1. Have someone to talk to and discuss everything with this person. For me, it was my sister. When it was bad I moved in with my sister for 2 months. She took care of me. I worked but she dropped me off and cooked for me – only veggies and a very strict diet for 90 days. This helps in the long run.2. Read Read and Read.3. Get to know your body. Document ALL your symptoms. For me it was over 20. Toe fungus, stomach, itching, mouth, tongue, burning sensation on chest at night, rapid heart beat, memory loss, mix up words/letters, etc.4. Know this is NOT an easy fix. I am in my 15 month of healing. I have done it all. Diet, exercise, reduce stress, rest, lifestyle changes including no alcohol for 18 months. I was a casual drinker. Don’t say you want to return “back to your old self”. Your “old self” was NOT healthy. You need to get to a NEW you and you Will.5. Develop PATIENCE. Do not try to recovery rapidly. Stay consistent with your foods – introduce new foods SLOWLY. I can eat pretty much anything now BUT I still watch and manage my Sugar intake, caffeine etc. Do it because you love yourself."
12,Vita,7,"Hello! I’m a holistic nutritionist that had systemic candida and now takes care of people that do. Here are my top 5 tips for newbies.1. CANDIDA DIET. You can forget about killing it if you’re not an anti-inflammatory diet. Yes it will be strict and some may be on stricter ones but it’s the very foundation of a candida cleanse. You’re literally throwing your money down the drain on supplements if you’re feeding the yeast that you’re trying to kill.2. PREPARE PROPERLY. Don’t jump into an antifungal straight away unless you hate yourself. Your entire system is down/suppressed when you have systemic candida. Using a strong antifungal is the equivalent of suicide. You will be causing more damage than good. Therefore look for extemely gentle detoxification kits to start off first and build yourself up.3. PROFESSIONAL HELP/RESEARCH. Honestly it’s quite difficult to overcome this without guidance. I was lucky I had my teachers at school. This forum has a wealth of knowledge as well. Granted what works for one person may not work for someone else. Moreover some professionals don’t quite know what they are talking about. I’ve had naturopaths tell me the candida diet is bs and I couldn’t believe my ears. Evidently they’ve had no experience with severe cases. If you go seek medical advice make sure they have the experience in it and don’t just know by “the textbook” how to cure it.4. LIVER SUPPORT. When you’re in the killing phase make sure you have a high quality liver support. Everything goes through the liver including the candida die off. Unless you want to have liver problems after your candida cleanse this is a must. Dont just do milk thistle, get a complex with good reviews, go to the store and ask for the best seller or just get some glutathione. Trust me I didn’t pay enough attention to my liver during my cleanse and now am stuck cleaning it months later.5. STRESS. Any STRESS you put on your body will weaken and provide more opportunities for candida to grow. Stress can be in the shape of a cleaner diet (yes that causes stress for you’re automatically starting a detox), strong detox supplements or highdosing specific ones, lack of sleep, and stress you experience emotionally and mentally. Sleep well, do deep breathing, take an adrenal support etc. There are many ways to go about this.Hope this helped!"
0,Janek,8," This statement is all from my personal experience, I’m not stating science or solid facts so please do your own research before deciding whether doing this treatment is for you. All my information about drinking baking soda I obtained was from the internet and decided to try it as I felt I was out of options. If you dont feel comfortable or have any issues drinking baking soda please dont do it. Please look at some of the comments underneath which give more fact on baking soda and the acid/alkalinity of the body. I think this treatment would still have worked but just took longer without it. The whole thing for me which i think gets rid of candida is getting it down to a really low level then doing a liver flush and then getting the healthy bacteria to high levels and keep your candida permanently under control. This is infact all my opinion but it worked for me. "
1,Rabelais,8,"  I’m confused… You are basically stating that it’s good to reduce acidity when fighting candida. Yet, today, Gizmo testified that he destroyed his candida by increasing acidity… It’s really confusing… Rabelais  "
2,TheXtremisT,8,"This is interesting, but not the be-all-end-all cure. You may feel better, and think you’re cured, but so many others have reported the same and had their symptoms and candida rage back because they had other complications. Just be warned. Like Rabelais I noticed you saying stuff about acidity and alkalinity. Now you need your intestinal tract to be acidic, not alkaline, in order to kill candida and other bad microorganisms. Candida thrives in alkaline environments, hence why it produces ammonia and damages the GI tract. This needs to be fully understood before you tell people things like this that aren’t true. By taking baking soda, you’re reducing your stomach acid which will negatively affect people (like me, and others with gut dysbiosis and hypothyroidism) with low stomach acid. In fact, this treatment over 2 weeks, with all the antifungals and probiotics and getting over die-off sounds way too farfetched. You may be telling the truth, but it disagrees with like everyone on here’s personal experience. Especially with ‘severe candidiasis’ as you claim. You factor in other complications that many of us suffer from, and it won’t work for everyone. There is no one plan for each sufferer."
3,Janek,8,"From what i know most bodies are too acidic due to bad lifestyle, foods, alcohol etc and you need to get your body a more balanced pH. Also bile is highly alkaline and this kills of the candida and keeps it at bay so i would say alkaline is better. Things like coffee and alcohol and all bad refined foods are acidic and they are all terrible for candida. Disease flourishes in an acidic body. I’m only telling you what I’ve found out myself online and what works for me, I’m not stating solid facts 🙂"
4,Janek,8,Hi TheXtremisT I’m not saying people have to do what i say i just want people to know what worked for me and to give people a chance. I 100% cured myself in two weeks doing what i said and i am so happier now compared to how I’ve ever been. I was unsure about the baking soda thing myself and have read on this site about it and on the net and all i know is after i drink it i feel a huge relief from the candida and i could just feel that it was working. If your not happy taking baking soda don’t. I’m sure what I’ve written can help someone out there and that’s why i wrote it 🙂 I only got die off the first say four days which was from the diet alone. That’s why i used the coffee enemas which really reduced it.
5,TheXtremisT,8,"I am highly sceptical that you ‘cured’ yourself in 2 weeks since you say you have gad a severe case for 10 years. The reason being is because it disagrees with everything that has been said on this forum as well as curezone. It’s great that you’re feeling better, have no more symptoms as you say, but I’d be careful with beer and other foods because it is highly likely it can all come raging back. In fact it is impossible to heal in 2 weeks all the organs you have mentioned. I cannot state this enough. If you suffer for such an amount of time, you would expect a proportionate amount of time to cure yourself. Maybe there are things you haven’t mentioned, or you weren’t as severe as you thought, but the way you have described your case sounds improbable. I’m not saying this to scare you, or argue, it just contradicts everything we’ve learnt about healing and curing. Just to let you know, being acidic and having acidic digestive tract are 2 completely different things.  Your blood should be just about 7.15 on the pH scale. Under that, you are deemed “acidic”. Your digestive tract is exempt from this, and SHOULD be slightly acidic to digest food and kill pathogens. Bile is slightly alkaline, yes, but what do you think happens when it mixes with stomach acid? Hydrochloric acid from your stomach is pH 1.5-3.5, and bile is pH 7. When these mix and reach the duodenum, the juices become pH 5, still acidic. This is completely normal. In fact, where bile meets the digestive tract, it is in no contact with any candida, so it doesn’t kill it. Bile is not highly alkaline like you claim. Candida is found lining the lower small intestine and the cecum in the large intestine. By there, the digestive juices are getting neutralised.  If you take baking soda, you’re reducing the natural acidity of the intestines, interefering with digestion and the capacity for killing microorganisms. For a normal person it isn’t an issue, but for those with low stomach acid and hypothyroidism like a large majority of candida sufferers, it is not recommended. There’s the science behind my statement. People confuse the 2 all the time, but this should give an indication of how important acidity is in the GI tract, and that it isn’t the same as being acidic in the whole of the body."
6,Janek,8,"Okay I completely understand what your saying I just found the baking soda speeded the whole healing process up for me. I dont want to spread confusion or state facts I only wanted to help with what I found worked to eliminate candida for me and my body to begin healing properly. If someone had given me this advice over ten years ago it could of saved me going through living hell most of my adult life….I was close to suicide and had serious mental health issues all from this awful disease. Anyway I dont want to cause any confusion and I totally agree with your points. Will look to edit my post and make it clearer for people to understand what I mean. I understand that candida may return so I need to continue to work at getting my whole body in balance, strengthening my immune system and staying stress free."
7,Rabelais,8," Janek;60519 wrote: From what i know most bodies are too acidic I was simply baffled when I saw two contradicting views appear on this forum almost simultaneously. One view advised to increase acidity, while the other view advised to decrease acidity. The proponents of each of these views backed their advice by personal experience. I found this contradiction worth pointing out. I have no opinion of myself. That’s because I know that a healthy body regulates its own acidity. Therefore, it is not possible to change the acidity of the blood, the organs, or any other tissues. It’s even not possible to speak of “the acidity” of a tissue. That’s because inter-cellular fluids and intra-cellular fluids all have their own specific acidity level. Acidity level even varies from one cell type to another. Given that it’s impossible to speak of “the acidity” of a tissue, it’s even more impossible to speak of “the acidity” of the body. Rabelais  "
8,EasternRay,8,"Our body can either be acidic or alkaline. And that can be measured, for example using urine. This is a good indicator. For a body to be healthy or to cure it needs to be alkaline. So, what Janek says makes sense. A big piece in curing candida, I believe, is the alkalinity."
9,Rall,8,"Hi Janek,Congrats on beating candida! I’ve been on the diet/probiotics/antifungals for about a month now and I finally started to notice some progress. Last week I was super constipated so I decided to get a single-use enema. Anyway it worked super well and I ended up passing tons of dead candida! So I decided to order an enema kit from amazon so I can perform these regularly, I definitely don’t want that dead stuff rotting inside of me.Do you think it’s necessary to do coffee enemas every single day? Would you actually see candida come out every time you did one before you beat the candida? And would you mind sharing with me what antifungals you used?Currently I am taking garlic pills and 3 tbsp of coconut oil every day along with 50 billion probiotic. The main symptom I am trying to resolve is a skin condition, so I was just wondering if you had any skin conditions prior to beating candida and whether they are cleared up now. Thanks!"
10,marjan,8,"Hi Thank you for you informative topic. It was really encouraging and hopeful. I know you write this a long time ago. I have 2 weeks holiday and I want to follow your diet. Could you tell me what you exactly eat during that time? You mentioned porridge, I was Paleo before and I quit oats but since I started candida and I do not eat buckwheat and oats I am starving. I’ve bought gluten free oats bran and I am soaking it. I eat broccoli, cauliflower, Swiss chard, spinach, cabbage and celery a lot but I still feel hungry. I used to eat rice everyday and it was so filling and eliminating it from my diet is very difficult and I used to lots of bananas but I could say that my diet was healthy. I bought 3 kinds of anti fungal as you told. I bought grapefruit extract, oregano and capilic acid. I suffer from dramatist, coated tongue, tiredness, horrible digestion and very temporary memory. I am 30 years old. Do you have any suggestion for me?"
11,laurenziano,8,CANDIDA DOES NOT GO AWAY IN TWO WEEKS. IT TAKES YEARS OF EATING TOO MUCH BREADED YEAST AND DRINKING BREWERS YEAST BEER TO GET RID OF IT IN TWO WEEKS. YOUR CANDIDA IS HIDING WAITING TO RE EMERGE. CANDIDA TAKES OVER THE WHOLE BODY AND TAKES DAILY ELIMINATION OF YEAST TO GET IT UNDER CONTROL. LIKE THE LAST FORUM MEMBER SUGGESTED URINE TEST IS THE ONLY ANSWER. BUY A MASON JAR AND PEE IN IT AND WAIT TWO HOURS AND CHECK THE BOTTOM YOU WILL SEE ALL THESE CLOUDS OF YEAST ON THE BOTTOM. THAT’S. HOW YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A CANDIDA YEAST PROBLEM. IT IS DOCUMENTED THAT 500 MILLION NORTH AMERICANS HAVE CANDIDA YEAST PROBLEMS. WHAT DO THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON THEY ALL EAT YEAST BREAD EVERY DAY AND DONUTS AND SUBMARINE SANDWICHES FULL OF YEAST. CANDIDA YEAST IS A YEAST PROBLEM WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO KNOW-CUT OUT YEAST OR SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.
12,Now Gone,8,"To Janek, Marjan and Rall. I am working on curing my candidias and have made progress. I have been doing some of the things Janek mentioned but I am going to definitely add the baking soda. The reason is that there is a German or Austrian doctor who uses baking soda to cure cancers and he said some cancers are an advanced form of candidias, so I think there definitely is some proven science out there. My husband told me about it, but I can’t remember the doctor’s name but I’m sure you could Google it. I’ve been on a candida diet for three weeks and before I had developed rosecea on my nose and face. It has completely cleared and I now believe it is related to the yeast. I am eating a Whole Foods diet (WholeFoods.com), low starch veggies and lean meats. I got really weak from eating the non-starchy veggies. There is a web-site out there called freetheanimal.com and it talked about adding resistant starch to your diet as a prebiotic to feed the good yeasts to help implant the probiotics. This research came from scientists who found that in mother’s breast milk there is a large portion of non-digestible starch that babies cannot even digest and it passes through but it feeds the gut bacteria to increase their immunity. I added a 3 bean salad which I eat cold and it has helped my energy a lot and well as helping me feel full. As the web-site tells you you will get some gas until the good yeasts are built up and you are used to the beans. There is a lot of conflicting information about what to do and what to eat when you have candida. I am keeping good notes and keeping in touch with what works for me and since everyone’s body is a little different I think you have to do that. At some point you should be able to add more seed grains (gluten free) amaranth, quinoa, millet, buckwheat and non=gluten oats. Depends on how quickly you build up the good yeast. Once you have been sensitive to candida you will always have to watch what you eat but after you heal you may be able to deviate a little once in a while but always get back to the healthy diet."
13,Now Gone,8,"Marjan, See my preceding post. I am off grains for now, but I added a 3 bean salad with olive oil, apple cider vinegar and a fresh lemon. I use chickpeas, black beans and pintos. If you buy canned rinse well to get the salt out. I also add a red pepper, red onion and cilantro (delicious). This is a prebiotic that the good gut guys can feed on to increase the probiotics. You may get a little gas initially until the bacteria build up. See freetheanimal.com web-site. Bananas and almost any fruit right now will send me off the roof, too sweet and feeds the bad yeasts. Once in a while I can eat a granny smith apple. I am also off the grains for a while but will add the non gluten grains as soon as my yeast is under control Amaranth, millet, quinoa, buckwheat and non-gluten steel cut oats (Bob’s Red Mill). I also can’t and don’t do diary as it will mucous me up immediately sinus, clogged nose and bronchials and it contains milk sugars. Anti-fungals I am doing Pau D Arco, Oregon Grape Root. Probiotics 2X a day 10 billion multi-strain. Digestive enzymes at meals (SuperEnzymes from NOW) with HCL to digest my food. Some theories that if you digestion isn’t good the bad yeasts feed on all the undigested food in your gut. My diet is from the Whole30.com web-site, except that I do eat the beans and no fruits at this point. Everything else whole and natural and some organics. Off all the bad stuff alcohol, sugars, flour, diary, pasta, anything processed prepared refined, etc. Only olive oil, flax and coconut oil. Keep good notes as to what works or not. Good luck."
14,laurenziano,8,I just want to add to a perfect post. Inspired me. I had diahrrea 15 times a day until a voice came to me and said its the yeast and I remember reading DO NOT EAT LEAVENED BREAD. CANDIDA is not the problem Its Candida YEAST that’s the problem. The yeast in bread and brewers yeast in beer is the catalyst that starts growth of Candida. I stopped yeast next day my DIAHRREA stopped and never came back for a year now. I know it’s. The problem. Yeast eats your colon and intestines and food and turns food to DIAHHREA. Once it eats through intestines its called leaky gut syndrome which is cause of chrons where people have their colon removed. Yeast doesn’t show up in blood tests or colonoscopy. Yeast is evil and is the infection. A yeast infection means the yeast is the infection like vaginal yeast infection is the yeast and ruins peoples lives. I know exactly what you went through I went through the same. The worst part for people is they don’t know what’s. Wrong with them and doctors tell them there is nothing wrong with you because they don’t. Have the equipment to find yeast.
0,Liz,9,"I have had to do a LOT of reading to find this out so I wanted to share for those women after me who might be where I was and to a degree still am.Candida is linked to hormones the toxins it releases even when we are not fighting and killing it mimics estrogen and some toxins trick our bodies into creating MORE estrogen than is actually needed this in turn causes PMS symptoms and “estrogen dominance” symptoms. When you go into a cleanse the die off causes havoc with female hormones.I had to stop taking probiotics + a probiotic multiplier two weeks ago after a months use because I crashed and burned. The physical symptoms I expected and was prepared for but not the mental symptoms and it was these that scared the Hell out of me.I had derealization, anxiety and depression as well as the intense flu like symptoms. I ended up in bed for 5 days. I am out of bed and still feeling weak and some physical symptoms but generally I feel better for the most part with the exception of some lingering emotional/mental symptom.I have come to recognise these to be hormonal symptoms X 100I am at an age when women are in perimenopause/menopause so I was already having increased PMS and hormonal fluctuations as well as candida which as stated above already creates havoc with the endocrine system. The hormonal symptoms I had prior to taking probiotics and die off were nothing compared to what they became since the die off kicked in.I am still getting sensitivity to light (This is listed as a menopause symptom) I am still getting waves of depression that comes on like someone flicked a switch and the same for intense anxiety. They can last an hour or two and go as quick as they came but the intensity is terrifying.These symptoms coincide with my own natural monthly cycle too and whilst I have had depression and anxiety with PMS before I have only ever experienced very brief mild cases of light sensitivity and derealisation.I can only hope as time passes these lingering symptoms will pass and fade too.It feels as if I have stirred up a hormonal soup from Hell with the result of taking the probiotics and releasing too many toxins than my body can release.I feel like I am tip toeing on eggshells as I am waiting for an “attack” of depression or anxiety or derealization and both at the same time as these attacks come out of nowhere dare I say just like PMS mood swings but much more intense and they are VERY frightening.Liz - UK"
1,dfbrl8,9,"Thank you so much for posting this! I was at my wit’s end before I found your post. I am about 5 months into a treatment for a probably lifelong overgrowth of systemic candida. Tx is overseen by a functional medicine doc. I’m on high dose of Nystatin 100000 units twice a day for 2.5 months. Mutli- multi- probiotic supplements, liver cleanse supplements and a multitude of other supplements to treat the die-off sx. This may be TMI, but I’m a nurse and this info is important. I have an IUD with progesterone eluding, and therefore do not have any bleeding at my menstruation, although I experience all the PMS sx; water weight gain (like 7 lbs), breast tenderness and swelling, mood swings etc. This is all routine. However, now my hormones seem to be all over the place, in terms of irregularity and spotting, as well as increased water weight gain (not during the pre-menstrual phase). I’ve been COMPLETELY depressed, all the time. My pants don’t fit, I have pitting edema in my lower extremities, craving carbs and sweets, and NO ENERGY. Fatigued all the time. Then, my period comes last week. With large amounts of spotting; more water weight gain on top of what I’ve just gained, more breast tenderness, BLOATING, my pants really don’t fit now. I’m even more depressed and have trouble doing much of anything besides getting up and going to work. I can’t say that I’ve been actually sick, but I wake with pressure headaches. I’m usually very active and a cyclist. My ask is what are you doing to help with these symptoms? How do I get rid of this water gain? I drink a lot of H2O, and have been craving coffee so much that I drink about 64 oz daily. I follow a keto diet, but my carbs may be in the 100 g range some days. Would anyone suggest using Maca to excrete the extra estrogen? Or would it even help? Any and all suggestions are welcomed."
0,Liz,10,"It should be common sense but even I made the stupid mistake of thinking I could cope with it so this is for all people who are new to candida, learn from my mistake!It’s a prebiotic supplement that basically multiplies any probiotics you take whilst also killing the bad bacteria and using the dead stuff to feed the good stuff … not very well explained, sorryHere’s a link: https://www.arthurandrew.com/floraphage-laboratory-reportI took it along with Syntol AMD (Probiotic made by the same company) and ended up with the worst die off ever which forced me to stop taking both supplements a week ago. I developed an itchy skin rash at the back of my knee (never had a those skin rashes in my life) felt spaced out and sensitive to lights (Never had that in my life) anxiety, depression, tinnitus,sleepy, aching legs and lower back, banging headache, constipation (of course)I was bedridden and terrified of the symptoms that affected my mind which I have never experienced before.The “spaced out” feeling was what truly terrified me. I was a mixture of feeling drowsy and having derealisation. Not feeling connected to what was happening or feeling like I am in a dream state. I also felt at one period like things that happened earlier during the day, were more like dreams or like I had watched them on TV rather than have actually experienced them, an emotional disconnection to memory I guess.I can live with ANY physical symptom and will take to my bed and “deal with it” but the effects to the mind and brain are something that terrify me as I worried they were permanent.I started off taking 1 tablet of each (Syntol AMD and Floraphage) every other day for 2 weeks and had physical die off which waxed and waned but I was more or less, Okay. Then stupidly and because I am “old school” I decided to increase to taking them both daily cut to two weeks later I crashed and burned with the above symptoms.I have been taking supplements to support my liver and of course not consuming any sugars.I haven’t had a ton of experience with Die off other than once I managed to get as far as taking 2 x Syntol AMD a day once whilst also avoiding sugars and felt the best I have felt in years. Stupidly I stopped taking them and fell back into bad habits. The die off from that was 2 weeks in bed with physical flu type symptoms which I just accepted as something I had to get through and to be fair I did.But by adding this FloraPharge to the Syntol probiotic I think has basically increased the effectiveness by a significant amount. I may have well have started taking 6 probiotics (or more) Plus I didn’t take any antifungals prior so…stupid in hindsight.So, don’t be tempted to take this drug unless you are much further into your recovery than I was and believe it can aid in repopulating your gut.Liz - UK"
0,Banshee,11,"I’ve been suffering from chronic yeast infections for almost two years now. I never properly finished the candida diet the first time and after some recent stress it’s come back with a vengeance.I’m looking for ways to speed up the healing, as this is truly driving me crazy.I have a lot of external irritation, for which I’ve used coconut oil and calendula gel. It helps a little. I’ve read about topically applying yogurt too – I don’t generally tolerate dairy, but might this be helpful? I’m guessing it’s purpose here is for the probiotics.I’ve also read that cranberry juice is excellent at restoring feminine ph, yet it’s a fruit. Rosemary Gladstar recommends 8oz a day for yeast infections, but I’m concerned about the sugar. Is this hooey or worth trying?I’m just looking to do whatever I can to get over this nonsense… Thank you."

2,ibeatthebeast,11,"I completely understand how you feel as I was in a similar situation to you. What I have found that has helped me enormously is making home made milk kefir from live kefir grains. All you do is find some high quality kefir grains online and order them, then once they arrive, you put them in a clear glass Mason jar and add 8 oz. fresh organic pasteurized whole milk (preferably unhomogenized if you can find it). Then you Cover it loosely with a lid, leave it out on your kitchen counter away from heat or sunlight, come back in 24-48 hrs, and it’s ready to be consumed!

The amount of probiotic bacteria and friendly yeasts in homemade kefir far surpasses anything you could possibly buy in the store or in a probiotic capsule. We’re talking hundreds of billions to a few trillion bacteria and yeasts! I have seen a huge improvement in my candida ever since I started having homemade kefir daily. The strains of bacteria and yeast in kefir have also been proven to be able to kill candida and other pathogenic microbes in the gut and recolonize the gut with friendly bacteria.

0,tajali,12,"My situation: I started the diet/cleanse back in August. I lost my period very early on after starting the diet (I’ve lost 25 pounds as a result). I was doing well so both naturopaths, my gp, my obgyn, all said I needed to start eating more. So I have. But I’m not really gaining weight. I’m so tired of this fight. I did well for 5.5 months. I’ve now probably tipped the scale a bit as I’ve had a yeast infection. I don’t think I can go back to a severe diet. I just want to ensure I don’t undo any gains I’ve made! My main symptoms were recurrent yeast infections, UTI’s, brain fog and lack of concentration. This has been the case for over ten years! I did the cleanse. Took rotating anti-fungals. Pro-biotics. Vitamins, enzymes. A lot of different things. I had seen improvements for sure. I find it all overwhelming at times as there are so many different things people are taking and recommending and at different points in their treatment. I really want to simplify things.Currently I take FLORASTOR an OTC probiotic (it is more saccharomyces boulardii as this seems to help me). I eat coconut oil daily. I take vitamins. I try to remember to incorporate glutamine & plant digestive enzyme but it’s sporadic. I’ve taken so many different things. I don’t know what to stick with. I don’t take any proper anti-fungals anymore because I was advised I don’t need them anymore. I’ve used boric acid sporadically when I’ve needed to. I did a month long treatment using it. I don’t want to feel like all the work I’ve done will be undone now but I also felt the need to shift my focus to get back my menstruation. I’m taking vitex (chastetree) I’m 37 and would like to give myself a chance to conceive in the future. And the future is now! I would love to know how to proceed without necessarily taking steps back. Any advice??"

6,Hope,13,"Yeah, I’m really sorry guys, but I have to agree with the posters above who said that the caffeine in chocolate is one of the primary reasons it’s a no go on a candida-diet. Even if it’s sugar and lactose free, it isn’t going to be caffeine free. Caffeine, even in small amounts, is going to feed your candida. Carob powder *can* be a somewhat satisying alternative. It’s caffeine free, but you have to get used to using it. In baked recipes, it can be used as a 1:1 substitute for unsweetened cocoa powder. Other than that, it does best when hot liquid is added to it (not the other way around – it won’t dissolve well and will clump up) while whisking pretty vigorously. I’ve made some yummy things with it and stevia, though. It’s worth a shot. So, sorry about the bad news on the chocolate. If you’re serious about getting rid of your yeast, though, you really want to get yourself off of caffeine completely."

0,raster,14,"So after 5-6 years fighting this and taking SF722 everyday, my ND said its time to go for the final knockdown. So I switched to a product called “biopure gamma oil.” Basically it is highly oxygenated/ozonated antifungal oils and you only need a few drops of it. The thinking behind it is yeast does not like oxygen rich environment, so by taking this product, it increases oxygen in body and thus reduces candida.After about 1 month taking 6 drops 1x per day, the yeast feels really weak and is not thriving on the bad foods, etc.https://www.naturepurenutrition.com/product/gamma-rizol-oil-100ml-from-biopure/The only drawback is its expensive, but should last about a year or so. You do not want to increase doseage but stay at same doseage throughout whole time you use it. I recommend it after a few years fighting yeast and for when you are strong."

3,marjan,16,Thank you for sharing your experience. is ASCORBIC ACID vitamin C? Do you take its powder or pill? What should I notice when I want to buy it? L-ASCORBIC ACID works the same? I’ve read that Lactose could feed the candida. What is your idea about it? I am new in candida diet. Thanks a lot

8,Now Gone,16,"I’ve had yeast on and off all my life, sometimes better and sometimes worse. This time in addition to a whole foods diet with lean meats, I am using some anti-fungal herbs, some supplements and digestive enzymes. I can’t do the diary as it has always gave me mucous and seems to clog my nose, sinuses and bronchials. I am also doing prebiotics and probiotics. On the Whole 30 diet you do only leans meats and non-starchy vegetables, but I got really weak with that. I read about resistant starches and that the good guys in your gut has to have something to feed on to increase, just like the bad guys feed on the yeasts and sugars (see freetheanimal.com) So I decided to add back some beans and do a 3 bean cold salad which is delicious. It did help my energy levels. Getting a little gas but you will until the good yeast builds up and you are used to it. This research was found when scientists found that mother’s breast milk had a lot of undigestible starch in it that babies couldn’t digest, but it helps colonize the baby’s gut. So my plan is to eat a good diet (whole foods), reduce the bad yeast population and increase the good yeasts. It’s slow but I am healing. I had rosecea on my face but now that has cleared up in about three weeks. I also drink apple cider vinegar every day, that’s about the only vinegar you can do. I do eat KimChi for probiotics as well as take supplements. I also pay attention to how I feel with certain foods as if you read different candidias diets there is conflicting information. I haven’t tried it yet, but some sites say you can have brewer’s yeast. I like it for energy and the folic acid. I don’t do any grains right now, but will add some seed non-gluten grains soon like quinoa, amaranth, millet and buckwheat. Keep notes of what works and what doesn’t as this is a long term diet change."
9,Jaumeb,16,"Donna, yours seem like a sensible plan. Please stay in touch."
10,laurenziano,16,Blocked nose with milk is your body expelling the mucous because you drank milk. If you kept it up you would eliminate a lot of yeast. Mucous is yeast. Vaginal yeast infection is yeast coming out. Yeast infection means yeast Is the infection or infector. If you stop yeast for a couple of weeks. You will know what I am talking. Yeast is also the cause of diahrrea. Yeast eats your food and turns it into DIAHRREA. Hope it helps.
11,ibeatthebeast,16,"You absolutely MUST give up all forms of dairy as they are damp-forming and will worsen candida, which you got in the first place due to a damp gut.

Here’s the protein bar. I am less cautious with alcohol sugars.

I woke up and my stomach was screaming at me and I sat i the toilet about 10 times that day. It actually was kind of nice beside the stomach pain in between gas episodes.. It was like, pin & relief all day…So, before I tell you the protein bars name & ingredients, I want you to consider that even if you refuse to touch sugar alcohols, 5 grams of Erythritol is nothing compare to a 25gram bowl of cereal with milk… I used Cereal as an example because it was cereal I indulged in on my first relapse.My favorite flavor is S’mores.****************** “QUEST BAR” ******************Make sure and get the bars that are gluten free & 1 gram of sugar or less. —————— Total Fat: 8 grams Saturated fat: 3g Trans fat: 0g Cholesterol: 5mg Sodium: 180mg Potassium: 70mg Total carbs: 13g Dietary fiber: 13g Sugars: 1g Erythritol: 5g Protein: 20gINGREDIENTS: Protein blends, prebiotic fiber, almonds, water, erythritol, unsweetened chocolate, natural flavors, palm oil, cocoa butter, sea salt, calcium carbonate, sucralose, cinnamon, baking soda, Stevia, cellulose gum, xanthan gum. ———————————————————————————— Perfect bedtime snack that I follow up with about an hour after the disgusting yogurt… doesn’t matter what I dress it with… Stevia and Cinamon.. either way I hate it…Now you have a sweet reward that will have virtually no effect on your diet."

I don’t mind eating frequently during the day, but I can’t stand waking up in the night hungry. Any advice?"

0,GreekCandida,20,"For 4 years i was miserable. Indigestion, burping, gas, constipation, diarrhea , malnutrition, hair loss, pale skin. I had all bad things combined. Sometimes i felt better because i was fasting and i exercized a lot even though i had low energy levels.I tried the keto diet but candida feeds on ketones so that didn’t work. I tried high carb vegan diet and that didn’t work. I tried high fat, low carb. I tried garlic, drugs, herbs ,everything.Finally after 4 years i can say i am cured because i have no symptoms, my energy is back, no gas, no bloating, no pale skin.The diet is simple.6-8 small meals per day(300 calories each). A really small potato or a little bit of rice with chicken breast and a little bit of extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice on chicken breast. So the diet is moderate protein, moderate carb, moderate fat. But fat from olive oil and not saturated fat. Be carefull with the carbs. If you eat a lot, candida will come back. Obviously you will not eat sugar, honey, fruits, vegetables, anything with high fiber, cheese, milk, beans.So let’s say 150g carbs from rice and potato, 60g of olive oil and the rest from protein. It’s an easy diet that you can follow for a long time because you eat carbs and fat and protein so you don’t feel hungry at all.1 user thanked author for this post.  HungryHippo"

However, there are still the occasional days where I physically feel restricted and on a daily basis I still struggle with brain fog, hypoglycaemia and emotional & adrenal exhaustion. It is starting to get to me that nobody in my environment understands what I am going through and cannot provide me with the support I need. Although to be honest, sometimes I am not even sure whether it is them not understanding, or the candida messing up my thoughts and emotions- I have discoverd it is trying to influence me and tricking me into feeling bad so that I will eat the foods it needs to survive. I was wondering if anybody else feels the same and struggles with a lack of understanding from their surrounding?

During 2 weeks of vacation each, I had at least few hours (3-4 avg) of intermittent sun exposure and happy swimming in sea each day almost every day during vacation.

1,RobyRob,25,I’ve been eating raw organic pastured eggs for years and never had a problem. They improve my candida symptoms. I think it has something to do with antinutrients in egg white.

0,KennyG,27,"Hello Everyone. If you have candida this is a MUST read. I’ve always had a white tongue growing up but never really thought anything of it. About four months ago I started searching for what was causing my white tongue / dry mouth and came across candida. “Great” I thought! I now know my problem. A white tongue was only one of my many symptoms. Over the last few years I have delt with almost all candida symptoms. I was so excited to start healing my body. I started on the strict candida diet which avoids all sugar. I starting taking garlic, grapefruit seed extract and silver water. Soon as I took the silver water I had brutal candida die-off symptoms but I was happy that it was killing off the yeast! I noticed that the yeast would get killed that day but would always come back the next morning. I thought there had to be more to the whole candida story. Why are so many people trying to heal their body in every way possible with no success? I searched for about two days with no sleep until I found what I was looking for. The answer? Mercury Toxicity! Quote from Dr. Hal Huggins  “Strangely enough, Candida is there to save your life. It changes methyl mercury to a less toxic (but still toxic) form. Bacteria change it back to methyl mercury, and the system goes back and forth. If Candida were eliminated while you have amalgam in your mouth, your health will not be as good as if it were there protecting you. Complex, but yes, there is a relationship.” Recent research has now shown that all mercury silver fillings release toxic mercury HG vapor 24/7. The amount increases with chewing food, chewing gum, grinding teeth, and hot drinks. Here is proof. Smoking Teeth = Poison Gas  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ylnQ-T7oiA Mercury: The Poison in Your Teeth by Tom McGuire, DDS  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cp8Rg8hNGwA Almost everyone I meet that has candida seems to have silver amalgam fillings in their mouth. The first step you must do is remove the mercury from your teeth. You must do this the safe way or you may become worse as mercury floods your body from removing the fillings. Find a mercury-free dentist that follows this protocol. Academy of Oral Medicine and toxicology (IOMT) recommendation for removal of mercury filling from the mouth. •Cooling the filling with copious water and air while drilling substantially reduces the amount of mercury vapor the filling releases. •Cutting the Amalgam into large pieces •Using a high-volume suction •Providing the patient with an alternative source of air •Using a rubber dam – A rubber dam isolates the teeth from the rest of the mouth and throat •The dentist and the assistant should remove and dispose of their gloves and the rubber dam once the fillings have been removed. Patients mouth should be thoroughly rinsed for at least 20 seconds after amalgam fillings removal. •Air purification system should be used. •A Patient’s eyes should be protected with protected glasses to prevent contact with spattered particles. “Dr. J. Trowbridge has written in his book “The Yeast Syndrome,” that some doctors specializing in candida treatment have reported to him that they have discovered clinically that 98% of their patients with chronic candida also had mercury toxicity. If you have chronic yeast infections or candida you must look into the mercury connection. It binds to the yeast cell wall and when the yeast cell becomes saturated or has absorbed all it can, roughly its own weight, it disposes of the rest as methyl mercury. It is a viscious circle that can go on forever if you do not remove the mercury while treating yourself for candida.” Now you might be thinking “I had silver fillings many years ago but got them changed to white composite ones” so how could I still have candida? OR “I never had fillings in my life! How can I have mercury in my body?” When a normal dentist removes mercury fillings he does not do it safely and this results in deadly mercury HG vapor being relased into your body which will stay there for the rest of your life. The only way to get mercury and other metals out of your body, bones, brain, and CNS is chelation therapy. “Chelation therapy is the administration of chelating agents to remove heavy metals from the body. For the most common forms of heavy metal intoxication—those involving lead, arsenic or mercury—the standard of care in the United States dictates the use of dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA).” What if you have never had any fillings? If you have candida and have no silver fillings there is a good chance that your mother that gave birth to you had many amalgam fillings. Heavy metals such as mercury are transmitted through the placenta to the foetus, so many babies are born toxic and live a toxic life until the day they die. “A 1994 German study showed similar findings in humans. Deceased foetuses, newborns and young children were examined for tissue levels of mercury. What was found was that the levels of mercury in the Brain, Liver and Kidney tissues were in direct proportion to the number of amalgam fillings in the mother’s mouth.” It’s true to say that silver amalgam fillings are the leading cause of candida. What if you and your mother have no silver fillings? How does mercury get in the body? You can thank childhood vaccines for that folks. Childhood vaccines contained thimerosal which is mercury. Many today still contain mercury which I consider slow murder. Other sources are seafood and small amounts in air, food, and water. Please note that everyone is carrying a load of mercury in their body. You can’t avoid it in this toxic world we live in. Mercury is poisonous in extremely small amounts. There are over 28 million micrograms in an ounce. Just one microgram contains over 3 trillion (3,000,000,000) atoms of mercury. After reading all of this nobody can sit there and say their candida is not related to mercury. It’s inside all of us! Who is to blame for all of this? The answer is mainstream doctors. Why? First, most of them have no idea about candida or the fact that mercury causes candida. Second, doctors think mercury is bound up tight with the other metals in the amalgam and that is never leaks. Third, when a person might suspect that heavy metals such a mercury is playing a role in their candida they take a trip down to the doctor for a blood test only to find out they have no mercury in their body. I have to tell you people that doctors don’t know anything about heavy metal poisoning or chelation therapy. I went to every doctor in my area with no help. I had six blood tests that all read “0” for mercury. I knew I was sick so I searched for answers. After losing all hope in doctors and mainstream medicine I decided to do stuff on my own. I was sick of them failing me so often or just trying to get me to take pills. “You are fine, you don’t have candida, candida is not real, you have anxiety.” You have to understand that doctors don’t want to fix you. If you are fixed you won’t come back and they don’t get your cash. If you stay sick and need a steady supply of pills then where do you think most of that money is going? In their pockets keeping them smiling and rich… while you on the other hand feel horrible. I found out that mercury and all other toxic metals are not in the blood.  They are in the bones and tissues and need to be moved to the blood for a accurate reading. In order to do this one must take DMSA for a week or so before a blood test. How can all doctors not know this? Brainwashed idiots. After getting 6 blood tests back reading “0” for mercury I freaked out. I bought DMSA chelation online and took it for one week. I then went and got a blood test and my level was off the charts. They rate mercury on a scale from 1-5, 5 being very high. Mine was 22. Never visit a doctor for a blood test, please find a wellness centre. The staff at wellness centres care about your health unlike terrorist pill pushing doctors. Everyone should take DMSA or some kind of chelation and get a blood test right away! It saved my life. I was also high in lead, tin, cadmium and others. I learned that when mercury is in the body it retains other metals, acting like a magnet. What makes me very sad is thinking about how many people are mercury poisoned right now and have no clue thanks to their doctor. These people will struggle with candida for life never knowing why it won’t go away. I had 10 big amalgam fillings. I had 5 removed the safe way. I’m getting the other 5 removed in about 10 days. Since having the 5 removed my tongue seems half as white. Stomach pain has improved by about 80%. I feel much better. I am going to wait until all the mercury is out of my mouth before I start DMSA chelation. If you use DMSA with mercury still in your mouth it can make you very sick as it pulls mercury out of your fillings and redistributes the poison in your body. I didn’t know this when I took DMSA with 10 fillings still in my mouth. Thank god I didn’t get sick!!! I learned that candida gets worse as you are detoxing from metals. This is because the metals are flowing all around your body so the candida is going nuts! Be patient it will go away! Some people give up way to soon. Candida won’t be gone until all the mercury is removed from your body. This can take all the way up to 24 months so don’t rush it! This is the best book on mercury chelation. Amalgam Illness  Diagnosis and Treatment  A book on how to cure mercury poisoning  by Andrew Hall Cutler, PhD, PE http://www.noamalgam.com/ His method of chelation is something like DMSA 12.5 – 50mg every 4 hours (including night time) for 3 days on and 11 days off. After 3 months add in lipoic acid (ALA) every 3 hours to remove mercury from the brain. (12.5mg to start) Lipoic acid (ALA) is the only thing that crosses the blood brain barrier and removes mercury from the brain. You can buy DMSA 12.5 mg and ALA 12.5 mg @ http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/products/ Since having my 5 fillings removed my insomnia has not appeared in 2 months which I have suffered with since my teens. Things are really looking up. Can’t wait to get the rest of this poison out of my mouth and body. This is a very good story I found while searching.  My Battle with Candida and Mercury Poisoning…The Connection “http://candidarecovery.com/bridget_mercury.pdf” If you have any questions then please ask. I am here to help. I will also keep you guys posted on how long it takes for my candida to get under control. Getting mercury out of your mouth and doing chelation are two of the most important things you will ever do!

1,Chris24,27,"Interesting, and nice theory. But, it just sounds too far fetched to me. I can not help but believe that candida is a response to unbalance. Balance that we distorted ourselves, and cant simply be blamed on something outside of us. It sounds too easy almost."
2,KennyG,27,"Hello to you sir. Before you make a decision, let me ask you… do you have amalgam fillings? Have you done DMSA and got a blood test for mercury? You may have been tested for mercury before but like I said all blood testing  will show “0” for mercury without using DMSA first. It’s been proven that all humans are carrying a load of mercury in their body so how could you disagree? It’s in the air, water, and food because coal burning plants in the USA release around 170 lbs of mercury HG smog into the air every year. Research it. Even a small amount will keep candida around forever. Take DMSA or some kind of chelation then get a blood test and get back  to me with your results. I can assure you, you will be in shock."

It’s been proven that all humans are carrying a load of mercury in their body so how could you disagree? No, I have no fillings. I have done blood tests, but not specifically for mercury. My mom had fillings when I was born though. I disagree because there is no reason to think mercury is the root cause of candida, when there are so many different complaints and backgrounds of people. Disease is unbalance. Due to mercury? Perhaps for some people, though I would first look at far more obvious causes and explanations. For me for instance: the link between the gut and the psyche."
6,Javizy,27,"I’m sure exposure past a certain point could tip the balance, and if you did have an accumulation, some focused chelation would be very helpful, but for most people you’d have to look past their fillings and ask why they’ve developed problems. Why do so many millions of people with fillings not suffer with these issues? Mercury can be naturally chelated by the likes of glutathione, which is an important antioxidant. I guess you’re taking ALA for this reason (it helps restore glutathione levels). ALA is found in most wholefoods, especially certain vegetables and organ meats. Healthy liver function is also vital for glutathione production. Just by looking at glutathione, you can see how this can be about much more than just dental amalgams. If your liver isn’t functioning properly through exposure to toxins, bile “recycling” due to constipation, consumption of junk fats, sugars, stimulants etc then it’s not going to be able to fully fulfil its role in chelation. If you’re not eating healthily, then you’re not getting enough ALA nor supporting your body in the many other ways it requires to chelate and maintain health. If you’re constipated, any mercury that has been chelated will be reabsorbed instead of excreted. I’m sure someone more knowledgeable could extend this argument well past glutathione. The point I’m trying to make is that, even though I don’t think mercury should be allowed anywhere near humans, people need to look at the wider picture of health and lifestyle and not just blame all their problems on mercury. By the way, among many other things, NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) helps with the production of glutathione (I believe more effectively than ALA), so you might want to add that to your supplement regime."
7,KennyG,27,"One of the main reasons I wrote this is because while I was learning about mercury toxicity / chelation / candida I came across many stories of people that got their fillings out, did chelation for a a few months and the yeast was gone never to come back. These are people that tried nearly everything for candida with no hope. You won’t find these stories easy by searching google, you need to dig deep and search health forums such as CureZone. I’ve only come across about one post on the internet that someone beat candida with the candida diet. One of the main reasons mercury makes candida run wild in the body is because mercury supresses the immune system even at small amounts. The truth is mercury is poisonous in extremely small amounts.  The Center for Disease Control states that there is no acceptable amount of mercury that can enter your body. “There are over 28 million micrograms in an ounce. Just one microgram contains over 3 trillion (3,000,000,000) atoms of mercury.” The reason there is NO SAFE LEVEL is because even just a few atoms of mercury can attach themself to your body’s cells. Your body then does not recognize these cells and tries to fight them off, which results in autoimmune disease. Please don’t tell me any amount is safe. We have waste storage sites inside us that fill up with toxins and garbage over the years, once these areas become full is when we are poisoned. Thats why some people don’t get sick until they are older. It also explains why some people with amalgams are not sick, even though they have loads of mercury inside them. If you have amalgams you must watch the video preview @ http://www.mercuryundercover.com We are being poisoned everyday. THE FDA and ADA have been hiding information from the pubic for years. They have known about mercury poisoning from amalgams for years. If you guys check out the “Causes of Candida” on this website (thecandidadiet) you will find this. “Mercury in your Fillings Silver amalgam fillings contain at least 50% mercury, and this is poisonous to the body. Mercury particles and vapor are continuously released in the body as you chew, grind and brush your teeth. Mercury significantly weakens the immune system and can be the cause of many health problems. One of these is Candida. The mercury leaks from the dental fillings and kills the friendly bacteria in your gut, allowing Candida to take over. There is no safe level of mercury to have in your system, so keeping it in your mouth is definitely a bad idea. If you can afford it, do take charge of your health and have them replaced.” They say Chlorine and Fluoride can also cause candida. I blame this more on the mercury itself… why do you ask? The ONLY way your body can detox chlorine and fluoride, as well as bromine is by using iodine. Mercury blocks iodine. With mercury in the body chlorine and fluoride will run wild. “Mercury from dental fillings can migrate to the thyroid gland and can sit on one or more of the thyroid’s four iodine receptors blocking iodine from reaching the receptors.” http://zap.intergate.ca/thyroid.htm If you watch this powerpoint presentation you will see that iodine is the only way to detox chlorine and fluoride. They estimate that 95% of individuals are deficient in iodine. I wonder why?

11,dvjorge,27,"Hi Kenny, I have brought that kind of information to this forum with the only idea of helping candida sufferers to find the right path to leave this diet and supplements forever. The result was some people turned the weapons on me. I agree some candida sufferers resolve it without addressing heavy metal toxicity, but those are a minory who have an active immune system. They only need some antifungal tablets to end with it. Others who are battling it with a diet and antifungals for months or years (most cases) don’t respond because something have their immune system totally suppressed. Mercury is most of time the culprit. You are totally right about the results gotten by those who have removed the amalgams and chelated. Those are who are able to leave the diet and eat what they want, even gluten again, without any relapse. I am following this path , and at the end of this month, I will reach 6 months chelating with ALA. I probably add EDTA soon. Too early to expect a total resolution but for first time in my battle I see the infection leaving my body seriously. I was symptom free two times but when I opened the diet, the relapse occurred. It is an smart decision to remove the amalgams and chelate. If you have had a candida episodic, soon or later, you will have to do it. Very smart the route you have taken, Good Luck, Jorge."

14,d510g1c,27,so excited im getting all three of my amalgam fillings removed monday and already have dmsa waiting! been wanting to do this for a few years now and decided to use my tax returns to finance it. not only do i have a pretty bad case of candida (which has gotten much better over the past month on a very strict diet and exercise program) i also have aspergers (high functioning autism). i truly believe the fillings are adding to the intensity of both conditions. i am very optimistic of the end results of removal and a few months of chelation. seen far too many stories of people in this situation where amalgam removal was a true turning point for them!
0,Banshee,28,"I’ve done the candida diet before, so have some familiarity of it. I followed it quite strictly then, and while I did make progress admittedly never completed it. It’s now come roaring back.I know there’s all sorts of restrictions, but noticed all my past flares were caused by excess sugar or starch, i.e. eating too much sweet potato. I never noticed ill effects from eating miso, mushrooms or other “allergenic” foods. So…Is decaf coffee or tea really so bad? Or teas with dried fruit in the mix (and drank unsweetened)? I would imagine the caffeine or natural sugars would be insignificant.Also, what about uncured pork, seafood or raw eggs? Is it really so bad to have lobster at a special dinner, or used pastured eggs to make a sugar-free mayonnaise?I’ve also heard xylitol is another option for a sweetener. I absolutely hated stevia in most things and wasn’t even aware of an alternative the first time around. Is it legit? About how much would a serving be without triggering a flare?I’m serious about getting my health back, but if I can stress less about my diet at least from time to time, I’d really like to do so.Thanks!"
1,Jaumeb,28,You have to find a diet that works for you. There doesn’t seem to be agreement when it comes to the details.
2,Now Gone,28,"HI Banshee, I’ve had candiasis all my life also from age 20 until now 63. Times when it was better and now worse. When I was good with my diet things were better but usually starting to eat more sugar and some alcohol, it would start coming back. This year it was really bad so I had to get serious and have been really good since about the middle of July. I started out just whole foods (whole30.com) and lean meats. But got really fatigued and had to add back some carbs. I found out through research that the good yeasts actually need the resistant starches to feed on. I added back yams (they are lower in sugar than sweet potatoes) and some black beans and chick peas. I did not do good with white potatoes or kidney beans. At first I couldn’t even eat granny smith apples (low sugar), but I could eat blueberries and strawberries. Now, I’ve healed some so I can eat the granny smith apples but I still keep the fruit to about one a day. What I did with diet was start with the basic candiasis diet and then modify it according to my tastes and how I felt. I kept a journal of what I ate and how different foods affected me. Even now, I cannot eat bananas or white potatoes. I did add back seed grains amaranth, millet, quinoa, buckwheat and non-gluten oat groats. I also eat some beans now. I look at my yeast symptoms daily such as is my tongue coated, are my ears itchy, fatigued, are my stools covered with stringy white mucous, is my face or skin breaking out. I then check my diet or stress levels. Stress is a real biggy that drains your immune system and lets the yeast get unbalanced. I use a daily multi strain probiotic along with FOS (a prebiotic you can find at the health food store) for them to feed on. I also used some anti-fungals oregano oil, caprilytic acid, oregon grape seed, etc. Also I took some glutamine to heal the gut. So, the cure is to find a diet that works for you, get the good yeast growing, reduce the population of the bad yeasts, reduce your stress (might have to make some lifestyle changes) and accept the fact that you will never be able to indulge much in sugar and alcohol, ever, ever, but hopefully you will feel good and be healthy. Good luck."
3,RobyRob,28,In my experience you can eat any food that does not convert to sugar in your gut and you are not sensitive to it.
0,nr_clark,29,"I know the website says to avoid eating carrots, but there are several other anti-candida sites which say carrots are OK.I know it’s not rocket science, but I’m getting mixed information. I guess carrots do affect certain people?I’m on my 2nd week of anti-candida, and have been eating some carrots. Die off comes and goes, but it’s at a minimum due to molybdenum and coffee enemas.Perhaps the progress would be better without carrots?"
1,Now Gone,29,"I have also found conflicting information on the different web-sites regarding candida. What I do is keep a log of how I feel and what I ate and how different foods are affecting me. Initially, I was just eating some lean meats and non-starchy veggies. I got really weak and constipated, so I had to add back some carbs. I eat carrots, sometimes sweet potatoes butternut squash and even a 3 bean salad. There is some scientific research that resistant starch is needed as a prebiotic for the good gut bacteria to feed on and multiply. I am also doing probiotics but the prebiotics helps them multiply quicker and maintains better gut health. Resistant starches are in cold bean salad, cold potato starch, etc. (see freetheanimal.com) I avoid just the foods that really send me off the roof which are fruits, diary, most grains, etc. Anyway, this is what I’ve found works for me."
2,Banshee,29,"I could do about 1/2 cup into the second phase. My RD started me on 1/4 cup first of carrot, parsnip or beet"
3,RobyRob,29,I get candida just by thinking of sugar. So I avoid carrots. Others say they can eat many sweet things and stay OK. I guess you have to try and see what works for you.
4,Banshee,29,"I advise waiting at least a month into the program, or when symptoms have noticeably diminished for at least a few weeks.Started sweets with green apples, berries and maybe winter squash? I think I was two months in before adding carrots.Regardless, I’ve found it helpful to remind myself that this is temporary. You’ll enjoy them again, eventually."

0,GreekCandida,30,"Hello my name is Nick and i am from GreeceFor more than 5 years i was always tired, i had indigestion, IBS, pale skin, white tongue, i had constipation some days and diarrhea some other days. I couldn’t drink alcohol, milk and many other things.I tried to change the diet first. I didn’t eat grains in the beggining and after didn’t eat carbs at all. To tell you the truth i did not see any major difference. All the symptoms were there. I am 183cm and i lost 10 kilos. I was 68 kilos and looked like skeleton.The only thing that worked in the beggining was fasting. I did not eat for 20 hours and i felt good but when i started eating again the symptoms were there again. But the only solution in my mind is intense exercise.I wake up in the morning and i haven’t eaten for 12 hours and i use my stationary bike for at least 1 hour. First at moderate intensity for half an hour. The key here is to sweat like crazy. Then for the final 30 minutes i give it all. I give it all for 5 minutes ,rest for another 5, give it all again. I do this 2-3 times eveyday. So it’s hard work everyday(2-3 hours)I feel 90% better. I started eating again, my skin is not pale anymore, i have more energy, allergies are gone. I am 80 kilos and healthy again. Also i became vegetarian. I don’t eat meat but also i don’t eat chocolates, milk, sugar or any processed foods. Usually i eat this. Boiled or baked potatoes with eggs, romaine lettuce with olive oil and some lemon or vinegar and maybe some feta cheese but in small portions. I also eat green peas and green beans. So it’s a rotation of potatoes, green peas and green beans. I also eat fruits but in small portion. I ll have one banana per day"

Cycling is better than running in my mind. It’s easier but still you are giving the message to your brain that you are running and hormones are released. Also as you sweat all toxins leave the body and you restart the liver and other organs.Diet will not help you in the beggining because all organs are not working properly."

1,cgoldie,32,"My die off is up and down, for sure. However, I can pretty much trace the ebb and flow by what I have consumed or my stress levels. I am about two months in and I made a lot of mistakes at the beginning.I started the diet while at the same time adding 2-4TBS of coconut oil per day, garlic pills, candi-gone, and pau d’arco ALL at once! I had no idea that my body would heal more slowly if I hit it this hard. My die off was nearly crippling. I was depressed, my acne was a lot worse, i was sweating like crazy, and so bloated I looked pregnant all day long. I was constipated a lot of the time. The hardest was how tired I was. I only have a part time job right now because I couldn’t find the energy to work more hours. I basically came home and had massive cravings for carbs that drove me to eating too much coconut and nuts (because it was the closest thing I would let myself have to what I craved). I ate WAY too much food and it exacerbated my constipation. I kept on with it because I thought die off was 1-2 weeks long. This lasted a month and a half with no letting off of symptoms.Then I cut out all antifungals and took coconut oil way down. I decided to just do the diet for a couple weeks. I felt amazing a few days in.Yesterday I had my first bout of symptoms again and I know that this is caused by die off because I had some coconut yogurt that had probiotics in it. I hadn’t been taking probiotics yet.It takes time. It also takes a mental space of self-care and patience. If I get stressed, I have more symptoms. If I’m worried I’m going to be hungry, I panic (I was malnourished and starving over a period of years with candida so I have some PTSD triggers about starvation). If I feel tired or bloated, I feel defeated.I think that die off changes with a lot of different things! The parts of our body are connected in ways most of us don’t understand. Die off happens when your body can’t detox as fast as it’s killing so maybe the toxins are building up in your body and you get symptoms for a bit until they leave your body. At least know that you are not alone in the ups and downs!"
2,kingbean,32,"Thank you for kindly replying. I REALLY appreciate it.Yes, this is a very hard ride and so isolating. What, no support groups!Looking back, I’m not sure how restrictive my diet even was – I was eating a fair amount of wheat and rice and had the occasional mini sugar binge. I’m wondering if I was both feeding the yeast and killing it, simultaneously?In any event, I’m going to tighten up the diet, which will probably feel funky, and see how that goes.Sounds like you’re doing better now?"
3,cgoldie,32,"Yes, I believe you can feed and kill at the same time and that is a cause of very angry die off. I was also doing that at first accidentally with a few things.I have read that Candida can double it’s population easily after eating sugar once. I don’t know how accurate that statement but I think it must be at least close. I believe it only takes one mini sugar binge or even bowl of white rice to repopulate at least enough to keep you feeling ill. So hard, right??I am feeling A LOT better but definitely not there 100%. The diet is hard to grapple with but I feel SO much better when I stick to it with no cheats.Keep me posted about how the diet is going! I have a lot of ups and downs with feeling full and knowing if my hunger is real or if it is candida talking still."
0,MadgeR,33,"I am 86 years old and have probably had problems with candida for more than 35 years. Every several years found me fighting it. This time around, I stayed off sugar and used compounded Nystatin capsules and Klaire Labs ABx Support for a whole year without decreasing my sensitivity one bit to Candida Albicans, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton–3 out of the 4 fungal organisms for which my doctor tests by injecting a small amount of antigen under the skin. I had wheals on my arm the next day of 7 to 9 millimeters. I have since found out that most pathogenic organisms, once they begin to cluster and form colonies, make a shell around themselves to hide from the immune system. (Even cancer cells do this, which is why Nicholas Gonzalez always had his cancer patients take pancreatic proteolytic enzymes to dissolve the protein shells around the cancer cells.) My doctor, whom I regard as a genius, subsequently prescribed Klaire Labs Interfase Plus, an enzyme preparation that dissolves the shell around candida. I am still using Klaire Labs ABx Support, since it contains Saccharomyces boulardii, a yeast which nonetheless kills candida yeast. In fact, my doctor says you can use this while you’re taking an antibiotic, as the antibiotic won’t kill Saccharomyces boulardii and the Saccharomyces boulardii will keep you from getting a yeast infection. My doctor has also given me Rinkel’s TME vaccine, and I inject myself twice a week with 0.25 milliliters of this. [TME stands for Trichophyton, Monilia (which is just another name for Candida), Epidermophyton.] After 4 months, I had defeated Trichophyton and Epidermophyton (no hypersensitivity reaction at all upon being tested for these) and have only Candida Albicans left to defeat. The die-off reactions have been difficult. I’ve had every kind of gastrointestinal symptom, weakness, nausea, aching, itching, and brain fog. But as you probably all know, candida, when it overgrows, branches out like a little tree, invading the tissues of the intestines and creating “leaky gut,” which leads to food and chemical sensitivities. I presume the other fungi I’ve been fighting do the same. And what I’m realizing now is that I probably never really got this stuff out of my tissues and achieved only a superficial “cure” in the past. I deal with feeling crappy (the bad days alternate with good days) by realizing that this malaise means I’m killing fungus. So I think “Hooray” and know that this will someday end and I’m likely to feel not only well but more well than I’ve felt in years!"

I had bad days 2 of them and then so far so good.Positive symptom changes: Slimming down lost a few pounds, feeling less dizzy and off so to speak, my skin rash is gone, I can feel the difference.My current regime: I have my anti-fungals and fiber that NOW fiber I like easy to get down, in the morning garlic capsule, caprylic along with the supplement called LivaTone my doctor approved it has dandelion, milk thistle B-vitamins (my liver enzymes were high so want to bring those back to normal too). Eat the anti-candida diet no fruits and just follow it eating meat that is hormone and antibiotic free and also the eggs the same no antibiotics expensive as heck (hoping to find other resources) and then a probiotic I am doing VSL3 sachet but 1/4 to half a dose max per day. It is super strong and had bad die off symptoms when I did a entire sachet last time. Lots of water and teas nettle leaf, dandelion and so far so good."

5,Alessa,34,"I had tingling in arms and legs as well, in the beginning of detoxing- this got severely worse when I would do anything physically and exercise was one of the main problems. In addition to the tingling I was really dizzy and would reach a point of fainting, felt very uncomfortable with people being close to me and if everything was coming at me. In my experience, I am about 2 months post that stage now, it does go away. But you may still have days where you experience virtigo or dizzyness."

0,Xianleather,36,"Im not a doctor, I dont work for the company that makes them either… and im not going to say this will work for everyone? But after dealing with Candida for over 2 years, multiple trips to the Doctors office and hospital I stumbled upon a probiotic recommended by Dr Rhonda Patrick who is a PHD in Bio Medical Science.. and has been on the Joe Rogan podcast talking about gut health… I heard her mention she takes VSL#3 in packets from Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals and it worked wonders fer her after a few major rounds of nasty antibiotics… But first a bit of my story.. 3 plus years ago I ended up with E -coli 0157-h7 , the strain that is deadly in a lot of cases, got through that , and was put on 2 rounds of Clindamycin , a nasty antibacterial drug that destroyed my gut balance even more . And of course my doctor never told me about any of this in combination with E coli…As time went by the symptoms got worse and worse to the point anytime I ate anything I felt the symptoms of candida hit me, feeling toxic, hot face, terrible gut pains, bowels going from one extreme to the other as well. it got to the point I wasnt eating because the toxic feeling was so debilitating I started to lose weight.. I was at my wits end..couldnt function at all… even after all of the tests with the Doctor and the Hospital nothing was getting better… I was trying every probiotic on the market, eating no sugar at all… no breads… nothing at all that would cause growth….and actually went to eating nothing but tuna out of the can , tomato’s, and water… still took supplements and probiotics.. Here is where the issue is… Most probiotics in any form , when left on the shelf start to die… in capsule or powder… so we get a very small percentage of live bacteria by the time we take those types… Re population is the key with Candida, to re populate with the good bacteria and force out the over growth of yeast along with starving it and having die offs…. Thats where VSL#3 comes in… its made as you order it, its shipped in a cooler, and its 450 BILLION per packet that you mix with water and drink…. Must be kept at a certain temp so check your fridge with a thermometer and adjust it if its not cold enough…20 days is where its said VSL#3 will have re populated.Im being honest here… the first week I did one in the am and one before bed, the second week I did just one at night, and the third I did just in the am… After the first few days bowel habits started to change… brain fog and lethargy started to diminish and my energy started to come back…After the first week, bowel habits remain regular , solid and no extra wiping , energy was still better, mood was getting better… ” Serotonin is produced more in the gut than in the brain and im sure candida inhibits that production and transmission causing the shitty mood that comes with having Candida”.. Brain fog had almost totally lifted and eating wasnt scary anymore… 2-3 week time , massive die off… was visible in stool as well, but wasnt the same as if you took antifungals or garlic in large amounts.. but I still felt it… 3rd week in, bowel habits still reg, mood lifted, brain fog gone, energy back, the nausea, bloated feeling and sickness after eating was totally gone… I decided to give more food a try… Sourdough bread… cereals with almond milk, Coffee with half n half and sugar, Ginger ale, curly fries, ketchup , mustards, and even some dark chocolates thrown in there… NOT ONE THING made me sick… I finally felt that normal feeling of being full from eating …. as well as no more waking up in the middle of the night for a sip of soda or cookies or carbs… I really believe Candida is the culprit for mid-night waking with a hunger ..always at the same time…SO, im in week 4 now… stopped the VSL#3 for the past 4 days.. to give my system a rest and will be starting again tomorrow morning.. with 450 Billion live per packet you can over do it… But for the last week Plus… Im eating normal foods, still keeping sugar at a minimum, my system feels normal again, Im eating without fear, brain fog and lethargy are totally gone, tongue yeast is gone as well, and I feel healthier than I have in the past 3 years….. If anything changes for better or worse? ill post on this thread..As well as when I go back for a checkup and see what the Doc says…. But I know how awful this is to deal with and really wanted to spread the word that I found something that works and works WELL .. almost right out of the gate… Ill put the link down here if you guys want to check them out and hopefully this will help some of you… Candida really brings your life and happiness to a halt a lot of the time… Best to all of you!Christian[LINK REMOVED]"
1,Alexisrichardss,36,"Thank you for this. The website is so informative, it makes me feel much more comfortable about spending that much money on yet another thing to fight my candida."
2,Xianleather,36,"Anytime!…. it really works wonders , I hope it does the same for you too! Candida is brutal to deal with, and this has been the only thing that has made a dramatic difference and still is….."
3,Sunspot,36,"Hi Xianleather,I’ve been dealing with Candida for the last 2 years… I’m currently on the die for a few weeks but it doesn’t seem to be working and I have a terrible vaginal yeast infection that is driving me insane… Did you have vaginal thrush as some of your symptoms? And did the probiotic work for that as well? I’m going insane… 🙁"
4,Xianleather,36,"Well I dont have a vagina so I cant say… lol Im a guy… but it did not only clear up my gut issues but it also cleared up my sinus and yeast on the tongue as well… It not only works by re population but as it re populates it gets rid of the over load of yeast and bad bacteria as well over time.. And grows new beneficial bacteria as well as whats in the packets already over time..This is from WEBMD on VSL#3Comment: My doctor prescribed VSL#3 for my chronic UTI’s and yeast infections. I have tried literally every probiotic I could find. I have tried herbs, medications, etc. Since starting VSL#3 I haven’t had one infection. It literally saved my life because I was not responding to antibiotics anymore. I also have bowel issues and it has helped immensely with that too. I would recommend this to anyone.here is the link to the page…. http://www.webmd.com/drugs/drugreview-93345-vsl3+oral.aspx?drugid=93345&drugname=vsl%233+oral"
5,Sunspot,36,"Ooops!! Sorry!! Haha I just made an assumption! Thank you so much for the information, I’m going to contact my local pharmacy!"
6,Xianleather,36,lol no problem ! there was no way for you to know anyway… best of luck and hope ya feel better soon!
7,Jaumeb,36,"Thanks Xianleather, I have been taking the vsl3 for a week now."
8,Xianleather,36,"Jaumeb ….No problem… its been 5 months now for me… Candida still gone, my diet returned to totally normal and I can easily eat anything now. Put on some good weight too, thankfully since I wasnt able to eat normally before .I came across another Dr Rhonda Patrick Video on gut health . To keep the balance from upper to lower gut we need complex fiber , since simple fibers dont make it to the lower intestines they’re absorbed in the small intestine.. the flora in the lower/colon begin to starve and eat one another to survive. That also leads to the mucus lining shedding. I found Super Seed Complex fiber and dded that in my diet also.. Makes a huge difference in the recovery from Candida and afterwards. I dont even have to take the VSL#3 anymore , but I have a box in the fridge just in case. I just take the complex fiber daily now…Best of luck! I hope it works just as well for you!"
9,Jaumeb,36,Thanks Xianleather for your message.
10,alexisMCA,36,"Thanks for sharing this with us re the VSL3. I was on this and stopped like an idiot because of the costs and also because my practitioner also had me on culturelle and I don’t have zillion dollars!Needless to say from what you are saying no sense in wasting good money on other probiotics and since I have been prescribed this as part of my regime more reason to get it and get going.I am going to start 1 in the am and 1 at night and see how it goes along with the antifungal garlic and see what happens.Thank you for this input because there is a lot of probiotics out there and its worth a shot. I have symptoms that are not fun the dizzy, fatigue, cold/hot, and not the way I want to roll."
11,Xianleather,36,"AlexisMCA.. No problem at all.. Always good to share good news on things that work and work well right? Just be sure to get the Packets, the other ones they sell dont have the same amount of bacteria in them.. The packs have 450 billion bacteria per packet… so you might be able to do just one per day or every other day and save some money on it? I swear by it hands down no matter what any Doctor says or believes about candida.. It literally saved my life . I hope it works for you and works fast!"
12,alexisMCA,36,"Great advice thank you! Awesome!I journal my foods, drinks and supplements and truly think this will help based upon the fact that the probiotics I have now are weak 40billion for 2 and not doing anything. This will help get the good back in the gut and then like it discusses I have the natural anti-fungals to go with in a couple of weeks and also an RX for the dyflucan.Just want to go slow and easy so the die-off side effects don’t take me down.It is nice to have solutions and also be able to share some good news with people when something works because this is a wide spread issue and not enough good info out there.Thank you!Here is to our health, and never being in this acute phase again!"
13,Jaumeb,36,I have been taking a packet a day in addition to beet kvass and psyllium. I just bought my 4th box. I can’t tell if it is working or not. I suspect it helps but I am no sure.
14,Xianleather,36,"Jaumed… try taking a complex fiber with it, Psyllium by itself wont make it to the lower intestine/colon.. get a complex fiber instead like Super Seed Fiber. It’ll help populate the colon ..Search Dr Rhonda Patrick on Youtube , she has Video’s/Podcast’s on all of this info .. One is dedicated to gut health/ probiotics and fibers… It’s where I learned all of this information and helped heal myself up…"
0,alexisMCA,37,"Has anyone had or noticed a red line above their upper lip? I had this begin about 2 years ago and it is there nothing I cannot hide with makeup, but I am now noticing it fade since I am on day 14 of eating properly using the anti-candida diet.If anyone has noticed this symptom I am curious. I believe it is directly related to digestion. I read this before online years ago but there was no mention of candida only GI issues on the particular site I found and nothing like this web site for input on symptoms.Thank you in advance – Alexis"
0,CandidaSurvivor78,38,"I’m new here, but I felt the urge to tell my story and what I’ve found that works.Backstory: I’m 37, female, 115 lbs and I love cokes, beer, breads and carbs. I’ve been on antibiotics many times in the last 15 years. I’ve suffered with symptoms (melasma, thyroid, tiredness, inability to lose weight, bloating, swelling, etc.) for years and only recently figured out it was b/c of Candida, so I quit treating my symptoms and started treating Candida itself. I’ve tried several products, but didn’t change my diet. My Candida journey began when I tried The Cleaner for Women. I noticed my poop had white, sesame seed, looking specs in it. After much research, I realized it was Candida die-off. Once I finished The Cleaner, I was back feeling the same symptoms b/c I was consumed with bad habits.Present Story: Two months ago, I bought Kyolic for Candida and Milk Thistle. While taking it, I cut back on all my bad habits, cut back is the key word. I started eating salads and consuming lemon water in large amounts. I didn’t notice much change until 3.5 weeks into it. I started itching like crazy, headaches, muscle aches, extreme sugar cravings (I’ve never been a big sweet lover, except for cokes), etc. It was due to die-off, but this time it was actually dying off! Die-off is miserable! I almost stopped my journey, but decided to press on. I won’t say I’m free of the overgrowth, but I will say I feel better than ever. I’m actually working out again b/c I have energy now. My skin looks a million times better and I’ve lost most of the weight I couldn’t get rid of after babies. I’ve received zillions of compliments from people asking if I’ve had work done b/c I look so much better, brighter and happier. My thyroid function has improved. Really, everything has improved. I still experience die-off symptoms here and there (usually after I’ve dabbled in bad eating habits), but I feel like a new person!Advice: Try Kyolic for Candida with Milk Thistle and cut out Candida’s favorite foods and drinks for 10 days. You may want to add a probiotic during die-off. If you know people that believe they have a gluten allergy, talk to them about Candida. Candida loves gluten and I’m convinced people with gluten allergies actually have Candida Overgrowth.My life has changed and I’m grateful for Kyolic and a little determination. I wish the best for all of you."
1,ickygut,38,"Thank you for sharing. I would like to ask how you found out that you had candida? Was this a doctor diagnosis or did you self diagnose? I scored a 357 on the test (85+) means severe case but can’t seem to get a doctor to find it on tests. I do not need them to tell me, I am just curious how you figured it out. Thanks for any info!"
2,alexisMCA,38,"This is awesome! I am on day 13 of the anti-candida diet and taking a supplement that has milk thistle but may be not enough. What dose are you taking? I think what I have is 275. I am also taking VSL3 sachet/packet but sparse amounts since it is a 450 billion culture whopping dose. Had really bad die-off the headache, dizzy and feeling tired but it is getting better but not good but at least I know there is a future that is bright.I don’t plan to revert back to anything other than this diet I don’t miss beer anymore and feel ok with eating antibiotic free meats and egg and veggies just knowing that I will look and feel better.Thanks for the feedback here!"

0,alexisMCA,39,Q: Anyone using candidate product that is mentioned here on the site? I started it today for die-off and to help I hope.Anyone have any experience or comment about it good or bad – I wont hold you to it.Thanks!
0,alexisMCA,40,Soy is it a problem for anyone?I read soy on the no list aka foods to avoid for anti- candida diet here however I read more carefully and it says because of GMO.I have a gluten free soy sauce I enjoy and 1 supplement I am using called LivaTone that came highly recommended by so many for liver detoxification as part of the candida diet has soy in it.I personally don’t believe I have a soy issue as an allergy.What are those here thoughts that are on the anti-candida diet and so forth in regards to soy?
1,Jaumeb,40,Imho soy is evil.
2,raster,40,Anything in low amounts is pretty ok but this is almost like eating sugar or something similar like vinegar. Its probably best to save something like this for later in your treatment.-raster

I was dizzy and felt constantly like was going to pass out. That is the worst feeling ever.

0,Ibiza-Rio,43,This is the link to my old forum thread: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst2244_Chloroquine-the-malaria-drug-a-cure.aspx So that I do not need to repeat myself. I am more adament than ever that Chloroquine is the cure. I just proved it again to myself just last week when I had a flare up (I had to take antibiotics to treat a UTI and got lazy with the probiotics). I was away for work and had left my Chloroquine at home (I am going to make a point of taking it with me everywhere now!) as well as my S.Boulardii capsules which I take as well to keep on top of things if I am anticipating a big weekend or something! Well two weeks of candida and the symptoms got bad again (I was being lazy with the diet and indulging in m&m’s purely because I knew the Chloroquine would fix me up when I eventually got home!) It proved itself once again by clearing it all up after maybe a week all up. No die off effects for me this time because it hadn’t yet become systemic. And tonight I just went out for dinner and had a lovely meal polished off with some banana fritters with vanilla bean ice cream 🙂 Please read my old forum thread for more info and discussion and check with a doctor before popping a couple of Chloroquine pills: it’s one hardcore drug with die-offs effects to match!! And spread the word please!!!
1,Jaumeb,43,Thanks for sharing your story.
0,JET,44,I just started the Candida diet and I have a couple questions. I really am sorry if these have been answered in the past…I had a hard time finding any answers.1. I have not experienced any die-off symptoms other than TOTAL lack of energy. I am worried I am not doing this right (even though I am 99.9% I am). Has anyone else experienced this? What might be the cause?2. Is it okay to have organic yogurt with live active cultures everyday?3. I am taking a probiotic but I am also eating 1/2 c of Sauerkraut everyday and 1/2 c of yogurt. Is this too many probiotics?Thanks everyone!!!
1,chrisluketaylor,44,"1. Some people react differently and not all candida species are the same.2. I have greek yoghurt with live cultures everyday (I mix toasted almonds and ground ginger in with mine). But I found that if I don’t have it after a meal and just take it on it’s own I get gas and bloatedness.3. Too many probiotics aren’t a bad thing, you will just excrete any excess ones. And it’s recommended to take a few billion a day if you have gastrointestinal problems."
2,FishaOfMen,44,My die-off symptoms produce a total lack of energy. My biggest symptom is sleeping 14 hours in a day.

0,linusreplay,46,"I used to battle skin issues when I was younger but since becoming more diet conscious, it’s not something I deal with so much in young adulthood.3 weeks ago after binging on fruit smoothies for 2 months and for a couple weeks not eating much food with that( i am in an intense school program) I developed the most aggressive candida rash I ever had.I had a few mushrooms or grapefruit, or strawberries and it would start burning and itching like hellfire. And that’s what my rash feels like if I haven’t taken any antifungals for a few hours.So along with the rash, I have these firm tender and sore ovulation clustered bumps on the crease of my thigh and closing my legs makes them grow and hurt more.they look like sort of inflamed pores with no hair and they merge with the rest of the rash…There’s intense sharp tingly pain that accompanies the bumps and that crease area. The tingly and sore pain sometimes shoots down halfway my thigh.I am slowly healing, keeping a really clean sugar free and fermented food diet and the bumps are gradually shrinking. I also just got a cold sore for first time in years. The skin issues is essentially the bulk of my candida symptoms, which is odd cause it really seems like I have severe overgrowth.Does anybody else get painful tingling skin inflammations like this?Thanks so much……I also went to get tested for stds."
1,raster,46,My wife has similar problems and its because your liver is overburdened with toxins and isn’t detoxing properly. When this occurs you detox via other methods such as skin or for some people the lungs (asthma and coughing). I would focus on detoxing to get better.-raster
0,Captain_America,47,"Hello, my name is James and I have been following the candida diet as taking natural supplements to help aid in the recovery process. To put simply what should I expect my time frame to feel and look normal be? Been the candida diet for about two months now and I have noticed the decline in inflammation however my body seems to be unable to lose weight around my waist and my face is still puffy. Back information is I was exposed to black toxic mold, after suffering an auto immune attack my body began to shut down non essential functions; this lasted about a year and half. The last two years have been filled with ups and down because of the doctors not knowing what to do with me as I went on perhaps not so pleasant trip down the river of what is now ‘modern medicine’. I postulate that some time after the mold and auto immune attack the yeast infection began to take over in my digestive track, (or perhaps this occurred because of contaminated food as I am allergic to wheat and gluten) as I took natural products to kill the mold off in my body but it didn’t kill the yeast sadly. So, the last two years have been filled with the ups and downs of continually poisoning myself with high carb intake as before all this unpleasant things happened I was a very active athlete. Spending hundreds of hours on research such things and after taking the saliva test I realized that indeed I was suffering from an infection and needed to change my current diet which wasn’t bad in all honesty even if I was consuming healthy carbohydrates they were still feeding the yeast.

0,Seashell,49,"Hi! In the past I’ve eaten a lot of quinoa and never had any problems – however, lately I’ve been unable to eat it at all as I’ve had really bad reactions to it… nausea, bad stomach ache and being unable to do anything besides lie down and rest for hours. It also feels similar to my soy allergy when I’ve eaten soy, a tingly, painful sensation around my chest/throat area.Could I have developed an allergy to quinoa? Could it be because I don’t clean the quinoa enough before cooking it? I had the problems immidiately when I tried a new brand of quinoa, but they persisted when I had quinoa from another brand that I’ve had no problems with in the past…I love quinoa and would be really sad if I’d gotten allergic to it :/"
1,raster,49,If you eat anything too much you can develop allergies. My experience with quinoa was I was not allergic to it first 2 weeks but then became allergic to it thereafter. I don’t think its perfectly safe for diet either. I would look into buckwheat as alternative.-raster

0,CandidaDestroyer,51,"I usually eat/take some of the following every day so that’s why this was surprising, and I know some can fight candida. This is months after using the store bought ‘candida killer’ products (that worked well).People close to me had colds so it started like this. I’d eat a lot of brown rice elbows (cold) with 1tbs extra virgin coconut oil, cayenne/black/red pepper, pink salt, 1-2tbs organic ACV before meals (I heard it helped lower blood sugar spikes). To avoid the cold I took 1,000mg Vitamin D, 1 ginger pill, 2 fish oils pills with high DHA/EPA, 500mg C, 1 Kelp pill, Zand’s zinc/elderberry lozenges (maybe 6 over 2 days), and a tsp xylitol with 4 drops of cinnamon oil stirred in (like pixie sticks, a dessert) before bed. Candida appeared in the toilet. The only things I didn’t normally take daily were the zinc-mix lozenges (rarely), ginger (not often), cinnamon (few times a week). Cinnamon USED TO make me very tired but not anymore, I assume it’s because there isn’t much candida left to cause major die off reactions. I’ve learned that it’s not enough to take 1 or 2 basic things (like garlic and CO) to kill candida, that can just fool you into thinking it’s gone etc.I don’t know about others but when I kill candida I get a feeling like I’m going to have diarrhea but usually only a little mostly clear watery stuff comes out and I see unusual things in the toilet (not a brown cloud), things I never see when I’m not killing candida."

0,Li,52,"Hi! I just wanted to let you all know that if you have constant problems with keeping candida down, you should consider taking butyrate and/or lactoferrin. I did and the candida seriously just went quiet. The lacoferrin has multiple functions, and I think the most improtant role is to deny the candida the iron it feeds on and instead help the iron go were it supposed to. There is a lot od info about it out there so just do a google search. Butyrate has pretty much healed my gut lining, or at least it feels that way. Again do a google search and you will find a lot of info on it. Best supplement for butyrate is in my opinion D’Adamos Intrinsa and Jarrow Formula for lactoferrin. Just wanted to let you know because it is such a supplement djungle out there and when you had a lot of sucess with one it’s important to let others now. Oh, and I buy the supplement at iherb since it’s the lowest price I’ve found, and please feel free to use my coupon if you haven’t shopped there before.

0,Kazuma5201,53,"Hey everyone. I’m a long-time candida sufferer here. Apparently I’ve had issues either since I was little, or otherwise as far back as I could remember is 17 or 18. It all started with Bloat and Should Swelling/Pain, moving to more and more frequent bowel movements, rashes in various places(primarily psoriasis-like in the scalp and losing hair) and more immediate bowel movements by the age of 24, very frequent(nightly to weekly) sleep paralysis by age 25(though it’s happened since I was little, but once every few years tops from what I can remember), and a list below of total symptoms at the age of 29(currently 29 years of age):Symptoms at their Worst(from my experience): Chronic Sinus Infections or Irritations Constant or On/Off Bloat to varying degrees(especially after eating or drinking) Urgent bowel movements immediately after eating/drinking, during, or shortly after Very painful/difficult bowel movements, feeling like a tie between constipation and diarrhea Frequent soft stool or diarrhea Lots of Gas either built up or expelled shortly after eating or drinking Stool smells especially fowl, like the inside of the world’s worst sewer Stool smells almost exactly like what you just ate Burning after bowel movement (not the expected kind from spicy foods either) Urinating frequently Urine smells almost exactly what you just drank On/Off Joint pains, finger joints, back-right shoulder blade and left shoulder/neck area, and others Frequently dry/chapped lips (enough to necessitate the use of chapstick) Frequently dry eyes (enough to necessitate the use of drops) Frequent cravings for “something sweet” Still hungry even shortly after eating and/or after gut irritation sets in Severe psoriasis-like symptoms on or all over the scalp, and other areas with hair Odd smell (that of bread or weed) from areas with the above irritation of scalp Hair loss Brain Fog after eating or drinking(kind of feels like being tipsy, but without the fun or distortion… just the awkward relaxation and clumsiness) Memory loss Frequent Exhaustion(I’m talking, time to pass out with not even enough energy to simply communicate with others) Exhaustion after eating or after bowel movement ​Depression, Apathy, Irritability, or other mood swing from Exhaustion Muscle weakness Very slow muscle recovery time(2 weeks as opposed to the normal 1-3 days) Random patches of Eczema for short or long periods of time on various parts of the body Redness, Itchiness, Dryness around Nostrils, bridge between eyebrows(if you wear glasses), eyebrows, corner/index of eyes, eyelids, corner/index of lips (feels a lot like sunburn) Tenderness, dryness, and stinging under the ear lobes at the index/fold, and perineum(taint) Extreme pain (sharp and burning) after eating accompanied by severe abdominal swelling Infrequent, but strong stomach pain when drinking alcohol, sugary drinks, sodas, or fruit drinks(usually within a few seconds after a shot or drink of something with low to high alcohol content) Shortness of breath after eating(like you’re breathing through a straw all of a sudden) When consuming anything sugary, you get the feeling of being relaxed and even “tipsy”, without the fun part High white blood cell count after eating and having pain (took an ER visit to find this one out, for me) Very thin or thick of “fuzzy white” coating on tongue(or even just a stripe in the far back) Dry cuticles and toes, flaking, or even cracking Phantom Gal Bladder pains Slow weight gain  Other Possible Symptoms(can’t directly link to candida however): Sleep Apnea Frequent Sleep Paralysis(I still can’t figure out why being in a area/zone of light prevents this)Essentially I had to be my own doctor, as I had been to over a dozen general, infectious disease, and GI doctors with ZERO luck(over the course of a year). They really want to push Anti-depressant and IBS-D medications on you don’t they? Jeez.Eventually, with enough googling and paying attention to my body, I discovered at the age of 29(right after my bday! happy birthday to me) what was going on and felt VERY positive of it at that point. I got started on these medications below:Nystatin 400mg Daily Candex 4 capsules Daily Ultimate Flora 1 capsule Daily, 30bil/8strain Diet of fresh cooked chicken/salmon + veggiesIt made an incredible difference and I could actually go out in public again without hovering around a toilet!

0,madmen998877,54,"Ok so when i was younger i didn’t know how bad antibiotics and i did not understand that after every cycle i should do probiotics right after. Anyways i did two cycles of antibiotics and i also drank alot as a i was a college student in a party phase, also ate pizza and poorly although was never fat i was in afct very skinny. Well when i was about 23 i started developing really bad stomach aches. I went to a doctor and a gastorlosigt. Both determined that they couldn’t find anything. After years i would suffer from severe stomach aches but not always. I would get upset tummy alot when eating fast food or anything really but it wasn’t that bad i would go to the bathroom relieve myself and i would normally be ok. However i would get those severe pain in my stomach and upper and lower abdomen maybe once a month sometimes once every 2 months.It feels like someone either punched my in the gut or like i swallowed a piece of glass. I have been highly constipated to the point i needed help from at the time my ex, three times in the last 2 years. Also i have had a fingernail infection twice although that seems to go away with regular toe fungal nail cream. However i have also dealt with anxiety and depression out of nowhere and struggled with lack of sleep for the last year. Even before when i slept i would wake up and be so fatigued. Well now lately i have felt like neck and headaches and feeling dizzy and foggy. I also crave crave crave sugar. I feel i have systemic candida. I have cut out sugar 99% of it i probably eat less then 5 grams of sugar a day,i have also cut back on carbs but that is alot harder. I have heard you have to cut out carbs but at the same time i have heard not everyone does. Anyways the anxiety or sever anxiety has gone away sane with depression. I also have a penile yeast infection and have had one for about a year. Its on my foreksin that looks red at times if i master bate and it looks wrinkling, however my scrotum looks red and like its been burned it doesn’t itch anymore or anything but nothing works.the doctor gave me three creams including nyastin and also diflcuan both didnt work. I have also tried lamisil and lomitrin and nothing. I have been eating alot healthier and also using anti fungal things not only on me penile yeast infection. I have started taking probiotics for now three months, how long should i take those for. Also i heard rotating anti fungal should be switched or altered. I have coconut oil, black walnut pills, pau d arco capsules, raw garlic, and i just bought apple cidar viengar with the mother and grapefruit seed extract to add to the mix, how long should i rotate and use those and also it true i can use those on my actual skin.My doctor and everyone i talk to dont seem to believe you could have an overgrowth of bad bacteria. I have gone three times or four for 4 creams and the pills and they did nothing. Can anyone please give me advice if im to add something or doing anything wrong or what any other advice. I cant stand looking at my own privates so i cant imagine anyone else would =( so sad to say i cant live a normal life anymore"
0,bluduck2,55,"Hello everyone, I’m looking for some advice regarding my journey through altering my lifestyle to control candida.First of all, I’m a 29 year old male who for the past 9 months has been dealing with fatigue, dizziness/imbalance, rectal itching, chest pain / tightness, and low testosterone.I’ve been to many doctors that did all sorts of blood work, long story short nothing came up in my blood work that would suggest infection. I’ve been on this diet for 5 weeks, after about 3 weeks I started to feel really quite good, then last week I had a few bad days of eating where I had wine and pizza. Now I’m feeling much worse again, did I just set myself back drastically?Does anyone have any experience with fluctuating symptoms? I’m trying really hard to stick to the diet, but it’s really hard as I am a very social person. Turning down beer / sweets / or anything is really a challenge. Any advice or words of encouragement would be appreciated. Thanks    "
1,taylorgillespie21,55,Hi I have been following the diet for about a month. And it’s hard to say if I am feeling any better. The one thing I have learned is it takea time and patient. Try to stick to your diet to a t if you slip you slip. It won’t set you back but if you think about it this way you’re basically feeding the candida encouraging it to grow. What you wanna do is starve it. I know it’s hard but it will be worth it in the end when you feel better. Keep your head high and do your best. Also try to get a candida cook book.
0,CandidaFree16,56,"I have the book, recipe book, you name it, but then, I look on the website, and there are some discrepancies for the detox or cleanse. It says peppers in the book, but the list on the website does not list peppers (same with olives). I also noticed that the list on the website has cabbage which would be so helpful for me because I can imagine seven days being able to have cabbage soup. I tried to make the soup in the book, and I was literally gagging on it, so I want to make something edible I know I can do before I start on this journey of the seven days detox. Otherwise, I think I’ll faint or fail or both.I bought this whole set last year and have been wanting to do it but scared with the die-off part. I think my body just came off sugar, so I had that for a few days, and it felt horrible. I’m doing great now though. I almost do not want to take anything and see what happens because I have been doing detox diets just not to this extreme point, so I don’t want to tip the scales and end up with headaches by taking anything just yet. Sinus headaches, itching (yes there ugh) and weight issues are my main problems. A light bulb went off in my head when I was reading Lisa’s book after wondering why this problem down there would not subside even after basically eliminating all dairy because that’s been a trigger of mine forever. I am intent on fixing this because now I feel I finally have the tools to do so.Can someone clear up my confusion about what we are allowed to have because I do not understand why there are two lists with different foods, and I searched in the forums for quite a while yesterday, and I am still very confused. Thank you in advance!"
1,texan,56,The list in the book is more comprehensive — the list on the website is a shorter version. Cabbage is fine!

One of the ingredients is corn silk extract which comes from the silky tassels running the length of an ear of corn.

I have candida as well along with some other auto-immune conditions.Thanks,Anita"
1,Percyfaith,57,Many years ago I took Cornsilk and it helped but Candida was not on my radar back then however a supplement called D-Mannose helped rid me of UTI’s. I thought were interstitial cystitis too. Did Physical Therapy – helped a tiny bit and Yikes I even took the antibiotic Cipro – don’t recommend taking that!!!!Anyway D-Mannose is GREAT.

0,Earthbound,59,"Hi,I’m Earthbound. I am 43 years old and started getting a rash on my scalp at the beginning of this year. It started out small and has since covered the entire back of my scalp from ear to ear. It then developed on my elbow, looks like cauliflower. Now I have sores on my legs and get itchy dots all over my arms and legs and stomach. If I get a scratch after about a day it turns white and crusty.I have been seen by a regular practitioner who has told me it is most definitely not psoriasis. I was referred to a dermatologist but my insurance ran out and have not been able to go. My boyfriend now has it as well. His is no where near as severe as mine.In our research we have come to the conclusion it is a yeast infection likely gotten through a yeast infection turned bacterial from our dog. Our unhealthy relationship with food and stress only fueled the fire.2 days ago I managed to get my dr to prescribe me Diflucon / fluconazole only to learn last night it most likely won’t help as it does not go into your lower intestines. However I am going to finish the pills in hopes it may help. I am also taking Coconut oil and Caprylic Acid and a probiotic daily. I live in a very small town so I am having trouble finding Kiefir.We have also changed our diet drastically. The past 2 weeks has mainly consisted of raw veggies, eggs and chicken with the occasional beef.Tonight I was itching so bad I dowsed my scalp in Apple Cider Vinegar, placed it in a cap and soaked in the tub with Epson salt and baking soda.

0,ned.hooton,60,"I say the following in the chance that there might be others out there like me, and for all to just consider what you are undertaking with this diet. I am not trying to outright discredit candida as a valid medical condition at all, only saying that when I myself went underwent the intensive diet for this condition, for a painful year and a half, it only ever harmed my health.I am an IBS patient, and have been as long as I can remember, and saw candida as a possible underlying condition, which if addressed might help some of my other problems(i.e, bathroom, congestion). I saw a naturopath, and for a long time was actually telling her I was feeling some improvements throughout the course of her treatment, as I now understand my overall health was declining. See the thing was, yes by cutting out all forms of sugar(fruit, carbs included)(along with many other candida diet components, and food allergies to top it off) it does follow and make sense to me why my congestion improved, and I briefly felt better.However in the long run, this went completely the opposite direction. Going into my freshman year of college, I struggled greatly to even feed myself with the incredible work load I was experiencing. Unable to quickly grab a meal, I saw my social life, energy, and free time disappear in an instant. I went from being super social, outgoing and active; to sick, tired, and miserable. During this time I continued to see my naturopath, and belabor the point that I was still feeling quite unwell, to which she eventually said, “I don’t know what your problem is frankly, you should just figure it out.”. So after she said that, I did. And how amazing it has been. I can eat practically anything I want(except for lots of spicy, and dairy), have my energy back, and can focus that on things other than being an ill person. I always liked to consider myself a happy person, but damn is it hard to be that same positive dude when you feel so different inside.This is just my story, and again I’m not trying to attack the condition as stupid or false, as it’s totally possible(Im no doctor) that people do suffer from candida. However, personally, I suffered much more from the treatment than the disease itself. I wish good luck with everyone’s journey to feel the best that they can, no matter your path to achieving that."
1,raster,60,"I agree with this and this is why I never tell people to do a carb free diet because you need carbs to be healthy. What you should worry about most is feeding yourself first, and not the yeast. I recommend eating some fruit on the diet as well because fruits like blueberries and apricots have anti-candida properties that should bring more benefit than detriment.-raster"
0,SaraMe,61,"My original doctor put me on this diet and prescribed 200mg of diazole (an antifungal) per day for 6 months. after 3 months of no improvement, I went for a second opinion somewhere else.New doctor says diet is bogus and just has anecdotal success; with no scientific documented success (she’s right on that last part, there are no true peer reviewed journal articles about this diet). And she prescribed 14 days of boric acid pessaries. After the 14 days I was so happy! All clear in terms of thrush.However, after sexual intercourse, it returned with a vengeance the next day. 🙁 I’m back to where I started.

0,rtejeda,62,"I am new to this forum but I have read so much into candida as much of you all know already. Anyway I have been fighting this for about 2 years now and I finally found something that has helped me dramatically besides the healthy diet. For about 2 weeks now I have been taking this Super Food /a multivitamin/ colostrum / and candida detox pills by Dr Tobias I have been drinking the superfood with many different fruits like papayas, apples, pineapples, bananas, and strawberrys. I take the Dr tobias as instructed. Also the colostrum i took through out the day tops 2-3 capsules. last but not least i have been taking the multivitamin because it has the metals that help with die off. All in all my digestion has improved DRAMATICALLY in just 2 weeks as oppose to the diet I was doing for the first 2 years. I still take garlic here and there as well as onions, acv, but these products have helped me and i hope it can help most of you. I had thin hair and lost almost 40 pounds and could not concentrate at all. I had terrible skin and i would get random ear ringing and random joint pains, constipation, irritation, and so much more.

0,jbn500,63,"Hi everyone:I’ve somewhat reached a wall and I was wondering if anyone has some good advice.I got a Food Allergy Panel test which also included a reaction towards Candida Albicans. I also got a Microbial Organic Acid Test. The Food Allergy Panel reported severe activity with Candida Albicans and my Microbial Organic Acid Test showed my Arabinose levels off the charts. So my naturopath told me to take Nystatin 3x a day for 2 weeks along with VSL#3 at night and to also go on a diet where I avoided simple carbohydrates, alcohol, and sugars. I was to follow the diet, nystatin and probiotics for 2 weeks, then stop the nystatin and continue the diet and probiotics for 1 week, and then start the nystatin again with the probiotics and diet for another two weeks. During this 5-week period, just the first week I noticed some die-off symptoms (I felt really tired with very light flu-like symptoms). After that, the only symptom I had consistently was this fogginess, or as if my vision was a little glossy, although I could see perfectly fine. And throughout the 5 weeks, I would occasionally experience symptoms that I would experience from before when I wasn’t on the treatment regimen. In a nutshell, if I have a combination of food and alcohol for dinner (for example, spaghetti carbonara and a glass of red italian wine–spaghetti carbonara consists of the spaghetti itself, of course, 1 egg, cheese, homemade ground italian sausage, and asparagus) then about 2-3 hours later, always occurring at night, I would start feeling sick. Namely, I would suddenly wake up and feel like my heart was beating faster, I would have difficulty breathing, I would have a lot of anxiety, I would need to go to the bathroom multiple times, the first time being a regular bowel movement, and then afterwards it would turn into diarrhea, and between all this, I would have to urinate every 10-15 minutes, and it would miraculously be clear as water. I would also start feeling nauseous and feel like I needed to vomit, although I never did. This would last 6-7 hours until I finally felt like the storm passed. Let’s title this occurrence a “Night Episode” for the sake of this post. Before I was diagnosed with Candida, I thought it was low stomach acid and I discovered Betaine HCL, which 7/10 times would allow me to eat the foods and alcohol that I wanted, without having one of those night episodes. But 3/10 times, it would fail and I’d be up all night.So after the 5-week regimen, I did another Microbial Organic Acid test (the results of which I’m still waiting for because it takes 2 weeks) and I thought I would try reintroducing foods. So one day I had a very small plate of macaroni and cheese (like 15 rigatoni pasta tubes worth). I was fine that night. The next day, I had the same quantity of pasta with a chocolate chip cookie and at night I had the famous spaghetti carbonara with 5-6 sips of red wine. Well…that night I had an episode. Up again all night after being clear of episodes for 3 weeks straight (longest time without one). My conclusion…the treatment plan hadn’t worked. During this time though, on my diet, I was also having whole wheat bread (I have no gluten allergy), some potatoes, and some corn (like corn tortillas).So I researched and came upon this biofilm concept. By the way, I restarted the diet the very next day after my night episode. So I called my naturopath and told him what had happened. He really was stumped as to how the treatment plan couldn’t have worked. I brought up the concept of the biofilm and he made it sound like it was more for bacterial overgrowth rather than candida. Anyways, he suggested that I get a few colon hydrotherapy sessions as well as start using Interfase Plus while doing the entire treatment plan over again.Here’s my new daily routine (this time with no complex carbs either):Morning – 2 hours before breakfast, 3 Interfase Plus capsules + 1 N-acetyl-cysteine capsule. 1 hour before breakfast, 1 tablet of 500,000 nystatin. After breakfast, 5,000mg of L-Glutamine, 1 tablespoon of coconut oil (or 4 capsules of coconut oil), 1 capsule of r-lipoic acid, 1 500mg Vitamin C capsule, 1 capsule of Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5).Between breakfast and lunch, I will pour 4-6 drops of oregano oil in a little water and drink it down.Afternoon – A couple hours after lunch, I will take another 3 Interfase Plus capsules + 1 n-acetyl-cystiene capsule. And an hour after that, I will have another nystatin tablet. With lunch, I would have had coconut oil/capsules.Night – most of the time before dinner (if enough time has elapsed since lunch) I will take another 2 Interfase Plus capsules + 1 n-acetyl-cysteine capsule and an hour later 1 nystatin tablet. With dinner, I would have had coconut oil/capsules.Before I go to bed, I have another capsule of r-lipoic acid, another 500mg of vitamin C, and another capsule of Pantothenic Acid (Vitamin B5) as well as 1 or 2 capsules of VSL#3.So right now, it’s been about 3 days since I’ve started the Interfase Plus, and still no die-off symptoms. Am I doing something wrong? I just don’t get it. I want to eat normally and enjoy my life again and not be afraid I’m going to have a night episode all the time.If it helps, the things that I believe led me to this place is the following:I was born via cesarean section so I think I missed out on the good flora of my mom through regular birth. Then my mom breastfed me but after 6 months or so, she gave me regular milk which I guess gave me an allergic reaction because I was so colicky, I would get ear infections all the time until I was like 8 (remember that pink antibiotic liquid??) and then after I started having asthma. Meanwhile, every time I caught a cold, I would take some kind of antibiotics, either Zithromax, or Biaxin, or something of that sort. In high school I had anxiety when going out at night with friends, so my doctor told me to pop a Zantac every time before and it would “calm my stomach.” Ignorant of what Zantac actually did, I popped them like candy. Then my mom passed away and I started drinking, a lot. So I would get heartburn and I would take more Zantac and doctors would sometimes give me Nexium as well. Then I started getting multiple cases of food poisoning and doctors insisted that I continue on Nexium. My bowel movements started becoming irregular and I was straining a lot so doctors thought I had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and gave me Xifaxan (very strong antibiotics, but not systemic, only for the gut). Nothing got better, so another doctor suggested I re-do the Xifaxan but this time, watching that I don’t have too much sugar to feed the bacteria. This time, I took even more doses per day and for a longer period of time (14 days). Nothing was getting better. I started having this constant urge to take a deep breath and I almost always felt this tightness in my sternum (which I still have during my diet and treatment for Candida), I had constant heartburn and I would have those night episodes as well in between. After this is when I discovered Betaine HCL and that helped me for several months until I felt like I didn’t want to take these pills for the rest of my life so I also got the Hiedelberg test which showed me stomach acid levels to be absolutely normal. The only possibility left was Candida and the test results I spoke of before showed I had it.Please, any help is very much appreciated. I’ve lost 10 pounds. I’m 6’1″ and weigh only 145 now. And it keeps going down no matter how many almonds, almond butter, coconut oil and avocados I eat.Thank you in advance.-Jon"
1,The Yams,63,Give this a watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOYIFKrGbrM.It talks about how healthy candida can be transformed into bad candida and eliminating ALL the bad candida is essential.I am on the standard candida diet but if that doesn’t work i’ll definitely try the above.
2,raster,63,"The problem is you are going back to your old habits from before the diet when this is something you should not do at all.  You need to give the bad foods and alcohol a break for a very long time and then it won’t be so bad.But if you consume regularly, you are overflowing your pool basically.  The diet will get your pool lower, but then what happens when you throw more crap in the pool?  It overflows!  So you need to stop throwing crap into the pool and then it won’t be as bad.  Eventually your reservoir will be lower and then you can throw more crap in the pool.It isn’t the diet/plan that isn’t working, its that you are testing your bodily limits by pigging out and having a good time.  Here’s something I wanted to mention…there are gluten free alternatives and stuff on the diet that is just as good as the junk food you want (except you can’t replace alcohol).  For instance, instead of getting regular pasta, get organic brown rice pasta.  Big difference.  Even so, I didn’t have pasta the first 6 months of the diet and I used to eat it every night.  I didn’t have alcohol for 2 years until my wedding day.  I didn’t have fruit for 6 months and potatoes for 4 months.  You need just tough out the diet and not live with your old habits.  Tons of good food out there and can give you some recipe links, it just requires lots of kitchen time.What you are experiencing is some kind of combination of allergic reaction and histamine problem, and this is also related to your asthma and toxicity in general.  When you have asthma, you are detoxing via the lungs because you cannot detox via the other 2 processes, via the bowels, and via the skin.  So you have all of this pent up toxicity from earlier in your life and you are just adding more to it, and your body can’t handle it.You don’t really need to add in more antifungals really, you just need to come up with a better plan that involves not eating bad food, addressing liver health and detoxing, and repairing the rest of your body.  In other words, you need to heal holistically and this doctor isn’t doing that for you.  And a good first step towards this is to get the diet down so you don’t lose weight and have plenty to eat, including 3-4 course meals and snacks between meals.  Instead of potatoes, eat rutabega.  Instead of alcohol drink kombucha.  Instead of coffee drink green tea.  Instead of pork sausage eat chicken sausage.The diet is going to be the main vehicle to get out of this valley and then go from there and consult some other professionals for advice to get better.  Since you found out you were allergic to candida, you can take candida hypo-sensitization shots:http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forums/topic/alternative-methods-to-get-better-if-you-reach-a-dead-end-in-your-treatmenrasters-perspective-41/They won’t really work unless you do the diet strict for awhile though, and same with nystatin.Adding in some b vitamins, vitamin c, coconut oil, and a few other things won’t really do that much imo, you need a more it sounds like.  Glutamine is a big one that has helped me.-raster"

Came back with every single symptom. Most worst were – stinging and itching in vagina; brain fog and lots of mood swings. I did not take a single pill(Flucanozole) since 10 months. Changed my diet and lifestyle. Recently started following “Ultimate Candidate diet”. Coming for Indian origin and raised on various herbs and spices, I AM NOT ABLE TO COPE UP WITH SPICES.

I mean when I leave out the bathroom, the person behind me, cant even tell I pooped. Im a man also. Ok, so Im guessing I may have loaded the good bacteria up in my gut, but Im still struggling with energy, focus, thriving, and depression. 2-3 out the month, I feel back to normal, the rest of it I do not.

What am I missing? Is it gut bacteria still, leaky gut, or am I looking in the wrong direction? Its only been my gut, that is my main problem, and I had gut problems before the last antibiotic treatment, that sent me into shock. Except my problem was constipation, and now I dont have that problem. Still struggling with cold hands, and cant stand cold temperatures, as a could before this."
1,texan,67,Sounds like you have a gut problem still. Have you tried eating more prebiotic foods or adding fiber to your diet?
2,healthychoice65,67,"Kind of scared to add more fiber, because this may cause problems with my stools. As I was just suffering from loose, soft, mushy, and smelly stools."
3,Sanshou,67,"It was nearly the same way for me until I started loading up on fermented vegetables and other homemade probiotics. Salads might be a good way to get more fiber, add in some garlic and dandelion greens you would be set for prebiotics as well. Also how is your salt intake I noticed mine went way down when I started cooking from scratch. It’s important to keep a small-moderate amount in your foods as it aids in digestion, fermented foods can help with that as well because it’s the salt keeps bad bacteria from growing."
4,Pogo,67,"Hi,I’m glad to hear that you’ve made amazing progress whereas your bowel movements are concerned!I suffered from severe candida overgrowth for nearly 4 years until a couple of weeks ago ago when I took the advice of a toxicologist MD who recommended that I get all mercury dental work and metals removed from my mouth. I had tried everything prior to the dental work, and still continued to suffer all the various symptoms related to candida. The allergies were so severe that I went from weighing about 155 pounds down to 114. It wasn’t until two weeks ago that I was able to get the last of five mercury fillings removed. In addition to the mercury removal,  I also had a few teeth extracted, they were the teeth that had previous root canals and metal crowns. Today, a couple of weeks later, I have gained three pounds, and I am able to eat foods that I had to avoid for nearly 4 years. I wish I would have taken the toxicologist’s advice 3-1/2 years ago when I first saw him, then I would have avoided all the suffering and debilitating life that I had to endure.I hope you continue with the candida diet program and recommended probiotics and fermented veggies! It’s great that you’ve experienced positive results in doing so.Sincerely, Pogo"

Good luck!"
2,Yuki,68,"I think the body can do well without carbs, but I have the same weight loss issue. What I do is try to eat extra nuts (even though some people do not when following the diet strictly) as well as buckwheat, quinoa, and coconut flour. Another thing that really helps me stabilize my weight is drinking full fat coconut milk and eating full fat yogurt. Again, these are not recommended when following the diet strictly but if you need to maintain a certain body weight you’re better off with a slower, safe improvement rate IMO.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently!

0,charlie1,73," Hi Guys, I just wanted to get some advice from anybody who has used a type of probiotic called Saccharomyces Boulardii. I have taken some recently but I stopped taking it about 2 weeks ago however, I still seem to have very extreme die-off. I’m not taking any anti-fungals or other probiotics at all now. They all stopped 2 weeks ago as well. I was advised to take this probiotic as it is a new way to combat candida, and I think it has been very successful…too successful though! I have been itching like crazy all over my body and I have this sort-of imploding feeling which is accompanied with severe fatigue. I guess what I want to say is I hope this is die-off and not something else, I’m getting a bit unsure as to why this is lasting so long. I’ve been following my normal strict diet and I am also taking Milk Thistle (100mg silymarin 3 x daily), Chelated Molybdenum (over 600mcg daily), Vitamin C (1000mg 3 x daily). Since I have been taking this additional supplements there has been some improvement but I’ve never experienced this reaction to go on for so long. I’ve also been drinking my own veggie juice which consists of spinach, celery and cucumber and fresh lemon juice. I’m getting a little worried as I’ve been taking these supplements for a while now and I’ve normally seen much better improvement after a shorter space of time. Can anyone give me some advice to what else I could be taking or whether the Saccharomyces Boulardii could be the problem? Many Thanks!"

0,gladsome,74,"I wrote about a month ago because lower leg cramps had been playing havoc with my getting a good night’s sleep for a month or more…waking me up 2-3 times each night. I was really hoping to get the green light for drinking tonic water which contains quinine, because I knew that would take care of them…it always used to. But, Raster nixed that… So, trying to be good, I started researching quinine and where it came from…cinchona bark. Also called Peruvian bark. Long story, short…I bought some bark, washed it, and ground it in a coffee grinder. I use 1/4 tsp. as a dose and take it once/day in hot water with lemon and stevia to taste…a tea. I have to sieve it through a paper towel to rid it of the grains and end up with a clear yellowish hot drink that I can tolerate. Best news…it works and it doesn’t compromise my candida diet. 🙂"
1,Sanshou,74,"From what I’ve read most muscle cramps are associated with dehydration. The relation to salt and potassium also play a role as too much salt will inhibit potassium absorption, causing muscle cramps. With candida we have a nutrient absorption issue where our guts have problems digesting and adsorbing nutrients, which exacerbates the problem. So stay well hydrated and I would suggest going something like a 1/2 distilled and 1/2 tap, I tend to de-chlorinate mine by leaving it open in the fridge for a day, as the choline will kill good bacteria. Or you can use a mineral supplement to offset the loss of minerals from tap water. You can also uptake your potassium levels or decrease your salt levels. But it’s important to stay very well hydrated as this illness will likely leave you dehydrated. Something else that helped me was eating homemade pro-biotics, I think it was the fermented vegetables as they have a lot of bacteria at home in salt, which may aid in it’s digestion. It’s also important to stretch if you feel tension coming on, yoga has some very deep tendon stretches that should help, I’m sure you could find a site that walks you through the poses without injuring yourself."
2,gladsome,74,"Thank you, Sanshou, for this information you have shared. I did not understand the relationship between salt and potassium. That is good to know, because I like my salt, and am probably exacerbating the problem whenever I use the shaker. Oddly I find I am wanting it more than ever when it sounds like it is not good for me… As far as more potassium, I think I will look online. I can’t seem to find any over the counter supplements that offer more than 3% of the daily recommended value. I guess it is assumed one can eat as many bananas needed to make up the difference. I have been taking one tab in the night, but perhaps I need to take more. I have always incorporated yoga in my life, but (oddly) have not been doing much of it for several months. Even though I noticed that the days I did stretch helped with the leg cramps. Lastly, water. Why do I feel this aversion toward drinking it? Especially when it is a choice between water and a hot tea? I feel I have been dehydrated for years and complained to my MD once about it. His comment was, “Some people are just camels.” Well, I appreciate your response so much better. Drink more of it. Period. I usually drink Poland Springs…should I switch to distilled? My root problem (and I am working on it!) is that I am not disciplined about my diet and exercise. I eat the candida diet, but notice that I choose the carbs still (homemade almond crackers) and other simple foods (e.g., almond butter on rice cakes for lunch) instead of veggies. I want my food easy and quick. I am not very interested in food, and I think I am sticking to the diet fairly well, but not necessarily eating a good and balanced diet. And, that worries me a little… But, back to the leg cramps. I think you have enlightened me about the connection between potassium and salt, and I will work hard at the water and stretching… Thank you so much."
0,janiejane,75,"I recently bought a bottle of Candex and starting taking it based on the very positive reviews I read. However, I recently did a little more research and was wondering what others thought about it. Here is what Candex is: Natural Enzymes to Digest Fungal Cell Walls Dietary Supplement About Candex Yeasts and fungi can flourish only as long as their cell walls remain intact. Studies show that the natural enzymes in Candex dissolve these cell walls. Candex is a safe, gentle and effective approach to fungal overgrowth, and has no adverse impact on healthy probiotics. The reveiws about this are overwhelmingly positive in helping them get rid of yeast. Most of the negative reviews I read where not necessarily about effectiveness but that people couldn’t tolerate it, (stomach pains, etc). If you search on this forum and online there is one guy who has repeatedly posted how Candex is bad, here’s what he says: I made a major discovery this week. Candex has two main enzymes that actually FEED Candida. Cellulase and Hemicellulase have a glucose molecule that degrade the cell walls of PLANTS. Candida is NOT a plant, but is a yeast, and these sugars actually cause the Candida yeast to RISE. These enzymes are used in industrial products for rising and in alcohol for fermentation. I took Candex for one week (24 capsules) and, boy, am I RISING and FERMENTING!!!! I stopped taking it when the reaction was weird. I gained 50 pounds and am still gaining. This information is from a Candida expert. I would give his name, but I do not have his permission. Thankfully, he has products that will remove the reaction from my colon and will kill the Candida for good. I have just ordered it. BEWARE CANDEX!! It will make your Candida worse! So far, I haven’t found anyone else to support this nor have I seeen any other similar claims in my initial research. I plan to research it more. To me gaining 50 pounds after taking it for one week seems pretty unbelievable. I found where he posted again on another thread and someone who seemed knowledgeable responded to him: http://www.candidayeastthrushforum.com/view_topic.php?id=857&forum_id=1 Able wrote a response to someone else on this thread: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst4378_Suggestions-to-add–remove–or-otherwise-please.aspx Candex contains two enzymes which are not natural to humans and which we do not produce. They’re specifically cellulase and hemicellulase. In theory, it makes sense to assume that a supplement containing enzymes such as Candex (and Candidase as well) could treat a Candida infestation because the Candida have a wall which contains cellulose and hemicellulose (note the difference in the spelling of cellulose, cellulase, hemicellulose, and hemicellulase). Therefore in theory enzyme supplements can help kill the Candida by digesting their cell walls. On the other hand these enzymes are not specific to Candida walls; they can also be found in the vegetables we eat. So the enzymes will also break down the cellulose and hemicellulose that is in these foods that we eat on a daily basis. When the fibers in vegetables are broken down, the byproduct of the enzymatic breakdown is sugar in the form of glucose which feeds the Candida infestation. Therefore all the enzymes will do is kill some of the Candida while feeding the remainder leading to an increase of the population of the infestation. "
1,Able900,75,"Lots of people have experimented with Candex only to find that the infestation grew worse while using it; this includes myself. Candex is nothing more than a source of enzymes, some of which are not naturally made and used by the human body. Your best source for enzymes is a natural form such as Swedish Digestive Bitters which allows your body to make the enzymes naturally as they are needed. Able"

Sulfer, so garlic is out I tried Allicin but that was worse. Coconut is a problem, I even had problems with Brita water filters and it turned out to be the coconut husk they use. Of course I have tried Oregano and a few others with equal results. I did start off with caprilic acid and that was surprisingly ok but you can’t take it for long. I know people will put things down to die off but I have had allergies/intolerance since I was a kid. Started off with cats, penicillin and geraniums. Even vitamin C doesn’t like me, they said take a 1000mg dose and that nearly finished me off. I went down the B12 route to see if I could get rid of the sulfer allergy but it had manitol in it and that not only upset my system but I got blurred vision for about an hour….scary!

8,raster,75,"Hello Mart, I would not put all of your eggs in one basket on this product, I think this is a bit silly. All candex is is digestive enzymes. This has been covered on the forum many times and enzymes can help you recover, but it certainly won’t kill very much candida. Enzymes basically break down the food you eat and help heal leaky gut. Used in conjunction with other supplements such as SF722, vitamins, L-glutamine, probiotics, etc. you can heal leaky gut and start to feel much better. However you need multiple supplements in order to get better and taking just one supplement won’t really do too much, especially just one bottle. I’ve been on pro-gest digestive enzymes for about a year and it hasn’t done anything to cure my candida. It has helped greatly with my digestion though and healing leaky gut. It gives me more energy from the food I eat. This is all it does. There are many enzyme products out there by thorne, integrative thereaputics, standard process, pure encapsulations, and other high quality major brands. If you look at their products you likely can heal yourself much faster with these than what you have tried previously. Additionally, I thought I’d note that it seems you are “allergic” to antifungals. You may be confusing this allergy symptom with die-off because they feel very similar. Have you taken any supplements previously to heal leaky gut and reduce the inflammation of the gut? -raster"
9,mart.hart,75,"Hi Raster thanks for your reply. I have been on a diet for about 3 months now. I gave up wheat first month as I thought that may be my problem, anything containing barley malt (or anything malted) give me huge problems so I knew I was along the right lines. Gluten free bread was no better though maybe the yeast but since making my own bread I have found out its also Guar/Xylitol gums. I understand what you are saying about die off/allergy symptoms. I managed to isolate additives with a 200 plus E number (E221 for example) which are sulphers. I have had a problem with these for many years an example would be Jiff lemon juice, dried fruit. These would not cause die of but they gave me allergy type symptoms. Pain under my left eye, itch in eye, bloated feeling and huge depression/very bad mood. I have also experienced die off symptoms with caprilic acid which are quite different, Flue like and I got a couple of small lumps with white puss inside as I guess it dumped bad stuff into my system. These I can stand in a getting better sort of way. The allergy symptoms are horrific though no real pain but the dark cloud bit gets unbearable."

11,jodie,75,"from my understanding of the inner health brand of candex, its a probiotic, therefore helps to crowd out the bad bacteria and replace with the good helping to control the growth of candida as its a natural inhabitant anyway but the real winner is the Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Boulardii) another type of fungus which i believe also crowds candida but only stays in your system 5 days after taking it. like a bit of a reset to reestablish good gut flora doesnt actively kill candida but in conjunction which anti-fungals and a good diet its a pretty probiotic when you’re trying to regain normality in the gut. im a firm believer that in general, a healthy gut creates a healthy person"

0,caterina81,77,"Hiya, So what I have found is that Cider Apple Vinegar is awesome for Dandruff, it completely got rid of mine with one wash, it came back about 10 days later but much milder. I just wash my hair normally and rinse, then literally pour the vinegar over my head, leave it for a minute and rinse it off. You would think it would smell but it doesn’t once your hair is dry. I can only ever smell it if I get my hair damp and even then its very mild. I buy Cider Vinegar with the Mother – Unpasteurised, Unfiltered and organic.. i’m sure there are many brands about. I’d tell you mine but people will think i’m just a sales rep lol! Also I have been getting super sensitive skin, itchy and my face more than anywhere is dryer than ever. I always use organic coconut oil as a moisturiser now, it soothes but doesn’t get rid of the dry skin so to speak. So yesterday i tried again Cider Apple Vinegar diluted with water 50/50. It completely took away the dry patches on my face I then finished with some coconut oil. I have tried everything for lady thrush, coconut oil etc which again relieves initially but I think my body may just have gotten too used to it and would then not relive it. You can add some vinegar to the bath which helps a lot which would help all your skin at the same time. or 50/50 with water again and apply it directly to your ‘bits’ I also drink the stuff, I accidentally had a vit C tablet that contain Maltodextrin and my tongue flared up, i drank the vinegar about 2tblsp to a small glass or something like a ratio of 20:80 vinegar to water. I think by far the vinegar is my best find for thrush so far, i’m only drinking it once a day but will up it to 3 times a day now before meals, its meant to be great too if you suffer with low blood sugar levels.

1,lolcandida,78,"Candida is caused by a slowed metabolism/hypothyroidism. This condition results from inadequate carbohydrate in the diet which serves to down regulate the metabolic rate, reduce body temperature, reduce enzyme and gastric acid production as well as immunity in general. Looking at candida as solely a pathogen is incorrect and not a holistic way of viewing the body. To beat candida you need to repair your metabolism so that the bodies own immune system takes care of candida without issue. All one needs to do is consume a diet very high in carbohydrate with adequate protein so that the body can repair itself. The problem is that when one has candida the digestive tract will not be functioning well and many types of carbohydrates will not be tolerated by the patient. The solution is to consume very easily digested sources of carbohydrates that even the slowest of metabolisms will be able to digest. These sources include: raw honey, orange juice, other fruit juices, and watery fruits like grapes. Carbohydrates that have a starch component like apples, or sweet potatoes will cause problems for those with candida because these types of carbohydrates digest slowly and allow candida, along with other pathogens that will always be present with this condition, to ferment these carbohydrates and release toxins into your blood stream. When one adopts a high carbohydrate diet composed of easily digested sources of carbohydrates the problem of candida will resolve quite rapidly. It should take less than a couple of weeks to notice drastic improvements in your condition. I consumed well over 3000 calories of juice a day to beat candida and heal my metabolism which now allows me to eat any food without issue. Further, it is a myth that you can starve candida. Candida has a mitochondria and when you restrict sugar from the diet your body will begin to release fatty acids into your blood stream to sustain energy. Because candida has a mitochondria it can metabolize these fatty acids quite well. This results in candida actually becoming more pathogenic because the immune system and beneficial bacteria become weakened in a sugar deficient state. Without these defenses functioning candida will be allowed full access to your body. Notice that no one in this forum has cured their candida with the candida diet. A high healthy sugar diet from natural fruits like oranges or raw honey is the way to beat candida by both strengthening the immune system and the metabolism. Everyone here on a low sugar diet can measure their body temperature and realize what I am saying is true. People here will have body temperature of 95,96,97 none will have healthy temperature of 98+ and this is why the immune system has failed to contain candida. You need to eat a lot of sugar to raise the metabolism which raises immunity and knocks out candida fully."
2,jameskep,78,Stay away from xylitol!! It can disrupt your good bacteria and possibly toy with your blood sugar. At high enough doses it can aggravate your gut. Aggravation of your gut can cause a change in mood. Blood sugar imbalances can also cause a change in mood.

1,TheXtremisT,79,"I’ve been doing them since August, with improvements along the way. I’d say: Try doing one first, 250ml. Wait 2 days then do another with more, then continue upping it to 500ml. If you’re going to do retention, do 2 rounds at 500ml cleansing first, with 1 tsp baking soda in 1L water. Or the lemon juice like you said, but go slowly. Then you could do a retentive enema with the probiotics/nystatin (if ou can get it) at like 250ml or less. I do them no more than 3 times a week to give recovery. Make sure you get rid of all the air bubbles in the tube. And don’t eat too close either side of doing an enema. It took some time to train myself to not get a lot of flatulence shortly after, or the feeling of needing to go. What helped was laying on my shoulders upside down for 2-5 mins after, then on my right side. The flatulence I put down to my gut dysbiosis. I used to get it almost exactly at the 5 hour mark after doing it, but it is not as bad now. But the main thing – go slow, don’t delve in to the lemon and probiotics. If it goes wrong, it’ll put you off doing more."

0,kjones02,80,"Hi Raster, I am writing this because I am just seeking your advice, and appreciate the help. I appreciate everything you have done for me, but I feel like some things need to change. I have been considering finding a different doctor to work with. As much as I enjoy talking to Bernie (he is very knowledgeable), I am finding it hard to work with him for me, due to the distance. I think that is why it has become hard at times to treat me. I don’t know if he has had problems with other people due to this, with a remote location. Bernie has given me lots of great advice, but then other things I find just do not work for me. I think he does get frustrated with me sometimes because I find other alternatives that work just as well that are different. Like some of the standard process products, I found another company that makes supplements, similar to sp; however, all of them are gluten and dairy free, biotics research. I actually think that makes a difference for me. I didn’t make the connection until this year. Now, I am not dissing sp supplements, they are very good, and some have helped me that he has suggested, such as cholacol, min-tran for awhile (till I found out the extra iodine bothers me), betafood, and a couple others. However, I watch very closely what is in my supplements as well. Like I mentioned, between you and Bernie, I have learned so much, how important it is to heal other parts of my body to go along with treating candida. This year I believe I have been making strides on focusing on healing my cortisol levels. I still get mood swings, like a girl, but I believe I am working on it. He has given me some good supplements on calming me down, and I try to focus on that, because I know if I don’t focus on cortisol levels, my digestive system acts up more. Then, I start doing crazy things! Also, I mentioned that other things make me frustrated because I know he says it is the microbes, fighting, killing, and I try to go slow on some of these things, but it just continues to make me worse. I think I am always going to be different, just due to the fact that I have gastroparesis/no colon. Plus, due to the remote location, (I know he wants me to contact him as soon as something acts up), but by the time I feel I do, then it gets here, I feel better. I do appreciate all this great advice he has given me that has helped, like some pleo’s (others make me feel bad): pleo ex, pleo citro, pleo form. Pleo fort, trich, san coli make me feel so bad! Other things that have been great are juniper berry, some homepathetics (nux vomica, and couple others for joint pain, since I found out I have osteopenia). I feel I have made good strides in treating myself, and I know I still fall at times, because I feel good, then mess it up, and get down because it take a couple days to get back on track. However, I know I still got to work on issues because I would like to still include more things in my diet, mainly fruit. I can still only treat myself with blueberries, raspberries, or strawberries every once in awhile. I do think it became harder to treat me, and for the fact, I am not dissing Able, but I think he might have made me worse, when I tried to listen to every single thing he said. I think it damaged my liver, and other organs more! So, I am starting to compile a list to fax to Bernie by the end of the week of all the things that I have tried, he has prescribed, or other alternatives that have worked or not worked. Then, we can evaluate on what to do, whether to continue treatment with him, or if it would be better for me to consult with somebody that I can actually meet here locally. Also, it keeps on worrying me, think it stresses me out more, about money. I already cut back on my consults with him to every couple months, and so many things have came up in the past year, extra bills. Ahhh! I like to feel good with diet, and some supplements, I can tell, if I miss them, I start to get grouchy, and not feel as good. I conclude by saying that if I change doctors, could you make sure to help me find a good one that is just as knowledgable as Bernie. I hate to lose track with him, but it is just hard to communicate through a remote location, I find. I hope if after I talk to him at the end of the month, we can come to a good conclusion on what to do. What do you think is the best thing for me? Others can chime in, too. I would appreciate the advice! Thanks forum."
1,raster,80,"Well Bernie knows a lot of ND’s around the US and so he might know of someone else in your area that is good. I think you are in more of a difficult situation with no colon, etc. Pleo ex makes me feel pretty bad when I take it, gives me really bad die-off. However after a few days or a few weeks of taking it, I can tolerate a higher dose without side effects. I have stopped it because I want to take it after I take boulardii (gonna try it soon I think) and hopefully heavily damage the yeast numbers. I think the ones that make you feel bad means that these are ones in high numbers…so you should try to take smaller doses of it if at all possible. You likely could benefit from someone who can meet you in person just so they can do acupuncture. Bernie’s other big skill is acupuncture and this can be done in conjunction with the supplements for maximum effect. It’ll help you recover from your setbacks faster. The spanish blood test will make everything easier for him. He places people into 4 categories and then into some sub-categories after that. I am in this mineral problem category of his where I may develop osteperosis, etc. later in life. The spanish blood test will reveal what parasites, viruses, microbes, etc. you are infected with. It’ll mention other things such as conditions of organs, etc. Then he can give you the dr. pascual remedies that are simply amazing (centuries old). The one I have been able to try helped get my gums to grow back (the roots of my teeth started to get exposed but no longer a problem). The Dr. Pascual guy is a genius and there is a whole line of remedies he created that are available nowhere outside of bernies office. These might be more effective than the pleo remedies. But the test is like $500+… If you don’t want the pleo ex, I am dying for a 2nd bottle of it! The pleo remedies got banned by the FDA as of now so bernie has to find alternatives. So bernie is kind of more or less guessing how to treat you and its kind of like an experiment with each patient. He has a set plan but its likely on 75% or less of what it could be if he had the spanish blood test. If you stopped the remedies he has prescribed, then you’ll slip back to feeling like you did when this all started and that’ll probably take a few weeks to a month or so to happen. Its a tricky situation for you… I kind of know what you are going through financially because the inflation is really squeezing everyone tight right now. Food prices went up 14% last year alone and gas is expensive too. -raster"
2,kjones02,80,"Thanks for the great advice! That is so good to hear that Bernie knows of other ND’s around because I as much as love that he has so much knowledge; I would like to actually see someone in person every couple months. I think I might understand things in a clearer perspective from meeting and talking with someone. I think that is why you have an advantage. You live there, see him in person! This must be nice. Plus, he rattles off things so fast that it is hard to keep up with what he is talking about at times. I have started compiling my list before my treatment with him, and during my treatment that has worked great, and other things that have not. I think that is why Bernie might get frustrated with me sometimes. Maybe not, he probably just wants me to be better, and it probably is hard to treat from a remote location. Also, I tend to try other things here at different times because like I mentioned, I don’t think some things work, and I have find alternatives that are similar to what he recommends. About the pleo’s, yes, Bernie always tells me to slow down. He said if it makes you feel bad, then decrease the dosage. I have even went down to 1 drop on some pleo’s, but I swear, even 1 drop makes me feel bad, then I skip a day, try again the next. I just can’t seem to handle them. The only ones it seems that have worked great for me, if I do have a lot of gas, 1 drop of pleo fort does help a bit. Also, the pleo citro and form helped me. The pleo form helps so much with my joint pain due to my osteopenia. I just can’t take the die-off anymore because I want to be able to function during the day. I would give pleo ex, but I don’t have that one. The ones I have right now are about 1/2 bottle of pleo fort, then pleo san coli, and pleo trich.You likely could benefit from someone who can meet you in person just so they can do acupuncture. Bernie’s other big skill is acupuncture and this can be done in conjunction with the supplements for maximum effect. It’ll help you recover from your setbacks faster. I would love to try this. I know one of my friends on facebook talked about doing that, and it completely eliminated all of her symptoms. My major detox is tanning for sweating, vitamin d, and relaxation. It is probably not good for my skin, but it makes me feel so good, and so much better!!!So bernie is kind of more or less guessing how to treat you and its kind of like an experiment with each patient. He has a set plan but its likely on 75% or less of what it could be if he had the spanish blood test. Yes, he has mentioned this test for me, and it probably is a good idea, especially for me, with the gastroparesis/no colon issue. It is funny how certain things can feel so good for my stomach (slow), but bad for my intestines. I have thought about just trying to maintain the best I can for awhile. I have started a money jar, to raise money for other things; however, it might go towards the spanish blood test.The Dr. Pascual guy is a genius and there is a whole line of remedies he created that are available nowhere outside of bernies office. Yes, Bernie has mentioned him. I know this magnesium chloride solution I have is made from him. A few weeks ago I got a scope performed by a local gi doctor. My primary doctor wanted me to see this one. I only did half a prep, with the no colon issue. I did find out why I struggle with going to the bathroom, but then yet can do too much to get it out. I have hemmorhoids. I have already been taking cholacol (just 1 with each meal, helps tremendously; I might have to be on this rest of my life, due to my gastroparesis/no colon issue, history of eating disorder, abuse of laxatives I think. It really helps me digest, and takes down the gas.) It really annoys me because I just can’t get it out, but I have to go. Then, my anxiety goes up because my intestines really rumble, and it feels like a blocked door down there. I have to take my middle finger sometimes to open up my butthole. It is probably a history of holding and constipation from my childhood as well. I read on old posts that you took Collinsonia root (in cholacol) and spanish black radish for that. How did that work for you? I try to supplement with magnesium to soften up the stool and make it easier from time to time.I kind of know what you are going through financially because the inflation is really squeezing everyone tight right now. Food prices went up 14% last year alone and gas is expensive too. Yes, it makes me so mad how much it costs to try and eat healthy, buy supplements, etc. Plus, I have had so many other expenses come up this past year for some reason. Also, I have a bad habit of if something doesn’t work, anxiety goes up, and then buy something. Heck, yesterday, I went to my health store to buy some things, didn’t seem like much, but it added up. Part of my problem lately too, is I am just getting tired, and I love to cook, but I need rest because I focus a lot on cortisol levels and stress now-a-days, and that includes rest!!! I hate that we live in such a high-paced society. I am worried about this summer because there is a lot of activities going on this summer. Weddings, vacations, my 30th, and I do want to celebrate! Maybe I can still talk with Bernie, just not a regular basis, just when I feel I need to, which not be very much, and concentrate on a nd, near st. louis here that Bernie might know every couple months. I’ll just have to see what he says about the suggestion. Any more advice would be appreciated? Also, speaking of osteoporosis. Do you know of any good calcium supplements? I think I still really need one! Finally, sorry if I have been on edge this past week. I have missed taking b-vitamins, and I realized before joining this forum, why I felt good on some and others not; it is due to methylation. So, I have been trying to supplement this past week. I feel good, then not, anxiety, then calm. I have been going through mood swings, and my sleep has sort of decreased a little."
3,raster,80,"I do not recommend calcium for males on the diet because it can potentially cause heart problems with males(look it up)…I had a bad experience from supplementing with it. I wish I told bernie I was taking it lol. Bernie is also heavily into meditation and tai-chi but I am not as open to getting into these as he is. He says this is the reason he works so he has time to meditate. If you haven’t done acupuncture, I highly recommend it. Try to find someone with 10+ years experience. There are even specific points for hemorrhoids. As far as treating hemorrhoids, this is something you should talk to bernie about being a big problem. He has a homeopathic that I haven’t had for awhile (unda one) that dissolves your hemorrhoid! Its all related to liver health…the spanish black radish works well for me. Also you can get other physical treatments on it such as a rubber band, laser surgery, etc. that removes it more or less permanently. This likely would benefit you greatly. Mine only gets bad if I eat a bunch of junk for a long period of time and drink coffee at the same time. -raster"
4,kjones02,80,"I’ll ask Bernie about the calcium. Yes, I have thought about meditation from time to time to help with stress. I think it might actually help me. I am a very high anxiety person! As far as the acupuncture, I think I might know of one person that might do it here. I think my old anatomy professor from my college days might do it. I still have his e-mail, and I was one of his best students. He was a nd, not a md; hmm, speaking of that, I wonder if he could help me with some things. Probably not though, he is full-time into to teaching here. Acupuncture, yes, though! I’ll look into it. Yes, I sure do need something for these hemorrhoids because they really affect my bowel habits, and I am tired of it! I hate having the feeling that I can’t get gas and bm’s out. It makes me feel so bad. It hurts my intestines, and then I feel I have to lay in the fetal position to get gas out at times. Like I said, it is like a shut door down there."

0,annab,81,"Review: Ortho Molecular Products – PRObiotic 225 – 15-3 Gr Packets If you’re combating mad candida overgrowth, drop all & learn more about these probiotics! After taking rounds of antibiotics (that killed too many friendly bacteria), in tandem with oral contraceptives and consuming large quantities of alcohol, my gastrointestinal tract was a hot mess. Enter: my nutritionist. Suffering from lethargy, skin problems (persistent acne), and arthrital-like pains for over a year, I decided I needed to reset my body and begin living more in tune with nature and the wonders it has to offer (i.e. organic s***). My “elimination yeast overgrowth” operation consisted of 3 phases, all focusing on serious detox and inflammation reduction. Of the entire cohort of vitamins, cleanses, and supplements I have taken on my journey thus far, these probiotics have had the most positive impact on my health. Paired with Thorne Research’s “MediClear Plus,” my body is on the yellow brick road to recovery & homeostasis! If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this saga focused on a.) detox b.) achieving clear skin, is that an internal balance is the most important factor in determining your overall health. Too often do we fail to conduct our own research & almost blindly follow the orders of our doctors (who are knowledgeable, yet not omniscient beings); don’t underestimate the power of a ~5 minute Google search on your symptoms in order to acquire more perspective. Looking back on my medical records, it’s mind boggling to see that I was prescribed round after round of strong antibiotics to alleviate acne, when all it did was perpetuate the problem (via killing off good & bad bacteria, thus leading to a candida overgrowth and overall imbalance). In closing, I’m glad to see a gradual – if slow – shift away from antibiotics as a panacea, and more of a focus on customized health regimens centered on homeopathic remedies."

2,dorimt,81,"Dear Annab Can I ask you what detox you did, any parasite cleansing? And what antifungals did you use to treat candida, cos with diet alone it doesnt die for sure! Thank you for your help, much appreciated! Dori"
0,Waitingindreams,82,"I have had a terrible candida rash under my breasts, for about 8 years (I have VERY large breasts) I have used antifungal creams before. The first one did nothing…then I was finally given a combination of desonide lotion and ketocazonale cream. This worked perfectly…but as soon as I stopped using them, it came back full force. I do my best to keep the area under my breasts clean and dry, but nothing seems to work. I’ve tried different soaps…including “Candida Freedom” and that did nothing either. I was diganosed with celiac disease in June of 2013, so I am already eating a gluten free diet. Now, I have transitioned into a dairy free, low histamine version of the Specific Carbohydrate diet. (This diet is completely grain free and low carb) I mostly eat grilled vegetables (non-starchy, like zucchini and broccoli), grilled or baked chicken, almond butter (no sugar added), and I sometimes (rarely) eat fruit. If I do eat fruit, I either eat berries or baked apples. I only drink water or sparkling mineral water…no coffee, juice, tea, etc. Just water. Once I get a yogurt maker, I plan on making homemade yogurt. I try to avoid processed salt and go for celtic sea salt to season the vegetables and chicken. I only use olive oil or coconut oil. For snacks, I have roasted pumpkin seeds. No sugars, apart from the few fruit I eat occasionally. I only even eat fruit because my diet is so limited, I need something else to eat! I have tried digestive enzymes as well as different probiotics. I have tried Culturelle, an SCD legal probiotic, and I am currently taking another probiotic from my naturopath. As far as antifungals go, I have taken Diflucan (just one dose) and I didn’t see much of an improvement…and then I tried something called AC Formula II (prescribed by the naturopath) I had to stop taking it due to extreme constipation…and I haven’t taken it since. My diet is so limited that I don’t have regular bowel movements…this is getting ridiculous. I don’t have health insurance right now, so I can’t keep going to the doctor…and i can’t order those creams again or spend a lot of money on probiotics. I need something that works. I do want to use those creams again, because I do feel that once the rash is gone, with my strict diet it won’t come back as badly as it currently is. I use Zeasorb antifungal powder to try to keep the rash at bay (at the recommendation of my dermatologist), but it doesn’t seem to be doing anything at all. I also seem to have minor rashes under my armpits now, that has not gone away despite switching to an all natural, aluminum free deodorant. What am I doing that is so terribly wrong? I read conflicting reports about fruit…some say you need to avoid it completely, others say you can have it sparingly. Regardless, I just recently added fruit back into my diet…the rash was HORRIBLE even before I did that. I do use Bragg’s Apple Cider Vinegar topically as a toner sometimes – it helps with my seb. dermatitis on my forehead. Does it really have any healing properties if taken internally as a cleanse? I am at my wit’s end. As for my large breasts, I was approved for breast reduction surgery, but I was advised that I could not have the surgery unless I cleared up the candida. I would prefer to do it naturally, but I am fed up. I just want to get rid of it. This diet is very hard to maintain and I’m not seeing any results. I am prepared to stick to a modified version of this diet permanently if I see great results…I just want to figure out what I need to do. Any advice? Should I ask for a prescription of Diflucan once I have insurance? Do any of the other advertised antifungals work any better… Candizyme, Candex, etc? Thanks in advance for any advice!"
1,lolcandida,82,"Candida is caused by a slowed metabolism/hypothyroidism. This condition results from inadequate carbohydrate in the diet which serves to down regulate the metabolic rate, reduce body temperature, reduce enzyme and gastric acid production as well as immunity in general. Looking at candida as solely a pathogen is incorrect and not a holistic way of viewing the body. To beat candida you need to repair your metabolism so that the bodies own immune system takes care of candida without issue. All one needs to do is consume a diet very high in carbohydrate with adequate protein so that the body can repair itself. The problem is that when one has candida the digestive tract will not be functioning well and many types of carbohydrates will not be tolerated by the patient. The solution is to consume very easily digested sources of carbohydrates that even the slowest of metabolisms will be able to digest. These sources include: raw honey, orange juice, other fruit juices, and watery fruits like grapes. Carbohydrates that have a starch component like apples, or sweet potatoes will cause problems for those with candida because these types of carbohydrates digest slowly and allow candida, along with other pathogens that will always be present with this condition, to ferment these carbohydrates and release toxins into your blood stream. When one adopts a high carbohydrate diet composed of easily digested sources of carbohydrates the problem of candida will resolve quite rapidly. It should take less than a couple of weeks to notice drastic improvements in your condition. I consumed well over 3000 calories of juice a day to beat candida and heal my metabolism which now allows me to eat any food without issue."

Rabelais  "
3,TheChosenOne,82,"Don’t worry about fruits. Fruits are excellent for detoxing. I felt much better once I included more fruits. Fruits are just simple sugar, which means that it doesn’t ferment in your gut unlike complex sugars. This doesn’t mean that you can start eating candy, because that fucks up your blood sugar. Fruits are known to stabilize blood sugar levels. If you are not confident eating fruits, just avoid the ones high in fructose. Another good source of carbs are foods high in fibers or resistent starch, like coconut flour or chick peas. Avoid simple starches at all costs! (bread, rice, pasta) A gluten free diet is already a good start. What lolcandida says is true in general (the holistic part). But I wouldn’t start consuming fruit juices or honey. Using Rx antifungals is nonsense imho, because it just fights the symptoms (the candida) and does not solve the problem which can be various. Do you have other symptoms?"
4,Waitingindreams,82,"Thank you for the replies so far. Unfortunately, it seems as the two of you are telling me two different things. lolcandida, I appreciate a different view on the candida diet, but do you have any studies to back your claim up, or was this more of a trial/error thing you decided to try on yourself? Was it just the mindset that low carb wasn’t working for you, so you tried increasing your carbs? That’s what I gathered from your post. I am not doubting that this worked for you, I just don’t see how it could work for me. Once I went gluten free, rice and potatoes became a much bigger part of my diet than they ever were. I saw my candida get worse…although the rash is awful, it is nice to have a visual so that I can see what is working and what isn’t. I love potatoes, especially when cut up and grilled, but I learned that I had to let them go. All grains as well. I feel my candida is because of a leaky gut, due to undiagnosed celiac disease (10+ years undiagnosed) You are telling me to increase my carbs and my fruit juice intake. I am trying to keep a rather low histamine diet, so rice and potatoes would be fine…but citrus juice would not be. Also, the last time I had grapes I became rather ill. I blamed it on the natural yeast in the grapes, and I haven’t touched them since. I really don’t think your diet would help me at all, but if there were more proof in that it could work for others, I would give it a try. Also, I am following the Specific Carbhoydrate diet, which does focus on consuming carbohydrates/food that are easy to digest. It is geared toward healing all bowel diseases, and as I have celiac disease I figured it’d be a good start. Regardless, the gluten free diet has not been enough for me. Potatoes are considered too starchy for this diet, as are all grains. Also, to respond to your point on hypothyroid, the SCD diet is also apparently a great place to start for those wishing to control their hypothyroid issues, including those with Hashimoto’s. As far as I am aware, I do not have a thyroid issue…but if I do, this diet seems like the great place to start for everything. thechosenone, I cannot have chickpeas on this particular diet, although I do love them! Especially hummus. This diet is very strict. It does allow some forms of dairy, but i am following a dairy free version of it. What are you using to control your candida if not prescription medicine? I have tried taking extra virgin cold pressed coconut oil orally daily, it did nothing. I am considering doing an ACV cleanse. I’ve added cinnamon into my diet as I’ve read that is another natural antifungal. I’ve heard bad and good things about the others, such as oil of oregano. I know garlic is a good one too, but I have a hiatal hernia and I try to avoid things that will aggravate it. What do you mean by other symptoms? As mentioned I have celiac disease, so I have a lot of complications from that as I try to heal my gut. Seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, etc etc. Major bloating when I eat certain foods, which caused me to have the hiatal hernia. My skin conditions have improved a LOT since I switched to more natural hair/skin products, and cut out problem foods, but the issue still exists. My hands are incredibly smooth and clear, even though it’s getting colder out. Normally they’d be cut up and sore from the cold. It really is discouraging when every time you seek out information, it all contradicts each other. Some say fruits are fine, others say avoid them. Some diets say gluten free grains are fine, others say go grain free completely. Now I’m being told potatoes are fine. I do trust the SCD diet when it comes to healing my gut, but I’m not sure it will be effective for candida. At that rate, I might have to heal my gut completely before trying to go back and kill the candida? Oi. Should I be taking certain vitamins daily? Can you recommend the best probiotics, etc? It seems that this rash is here to stay. Is there a possibility that I actually don’t have candida internally, and the rash is just a yeast infection on my skin? I don’t seem to have yeast issues anywhere else, apart from now under my armpits. (That seemed to start by an allergic reaction to deodorant, it was odd) I am going to try to apply apple cider vinegar topically to see if that does anything."

Your body is detoxing via the skin because your bodies ability to detox toxins is impaired…your body detoxes via 3 basic methods, the lungs, the skin, and the bowels.

6,Waitingindreams,82,"raster, thank you for your reply. I do have low levels of stomach acid, as I have acid reflux caused by a hiatal hernia. I do not take anything for this. My PCP was the one that prescribed me medication for the acid reflux (he didn’t realize I had a hernia, he thought I just had GERD). I have tried taking pepcid, prilosec, etc, and all seemed to make it worse. (Little did i know it was because my stomach acid levels were too low, not too high) I stopped taking them…then months later my naturopath discovered I had a hiatal hernia caused by all of the extra weight of bloat around my abdomen…due to the undiagnosed celiac disease and unknown food intolerances, like soy. (It never ends) So I don’t necessarily feel the need to have my levels checked if I know that they are low. (I’ve done a lot of research, and found out that acid reflux problems means you have low stomach acid, not high) What is the next step? Should I talk to my doctor about supplementing with HCL? I’ve never heard of that! I have had my hernia adjusted twice so far…it came back again after I was severely constipated during a strict candida regimen (Honestly, it never ends…) so right now, I am focusing on getting the bloating down and strengthening my abdominal muscles, and then having it adjusted. I am not very overweight, I just carry a lot of weight in my stomach, all bloat. Some days I would look 9 months pregnant. It’s been exhausting. I do not want to have the surgery for it, as everything I’ve read has been against it. In many cases it comes back…and with my candida problem I can’t have surgery anyway. I read through the posts on the thread you sent me, should I be tested for H.pylori, then? Hmm…this is all very interesting…wow! Lol. I’m going to have to make a list. Also, how do I focus on my liver health? Not really sure how to check in on that. Thank you!"
7,TheChosenOne,82,"Bloating means fermentation which is the main source of candida. Do what raster said, take HCl, which is the most important supplement if you have low stomach acid. Coconut oil is quite strong normally… Other antifungals: caprylic acid, oregano oil, red thyme and brussels sprouts. The problem with brussels sprouts is the fact that it is high in sulfurs. I see that you only drink water. That should be ok. But you may drink other stuff like tea and soy milk (beware! organic). Do not eat potatoes as they are simple starches."
8,Waitingindreams,82,"I drink unsweetened coconut milk and/or almond milk occasionally. I cannot have soy. I avoid all forms of caffeine. I have to stress that my gut problems go far beyond candida, and i have other issues to heal due to my villi being damaged from celiac disease. I am not supposed to have any tea, or coffee. I am on a very strict gut healing diet that lists explicitly what you can, and cannot have. I am on a stricter version, as I have avoided all dairy. The bloating is probably caused in part by candida, but it went down tremendously after doing food elimination diets. Are those the natural antifungals that have worked for you? I have read that all vegetables have antifungal effects…that they all ‘carry’ candida out of your body with them. I’ve increased my vegetable intake a lot, and it doesn’t seem like my rash has improved at all. Caprylic acid, isn’t that found in coconut oil naturally? Isn’t it better to get it from the source? As for taking HCL, I saw a reply in his post that suggests that one get tested for H.Pylori before starting an HCL supplement. Is that really necessary?"
9,raster,82,"Bloating and inflammation have a strong relationship. I would consult your ND about supplementing with boulardii if you want this to improve (its highly anti-inflammatory). Your stomach will look flat like you are a teenager when you are all done with it after a few weeks. Boulardii also produces lactic acid which should help with stomach acid levels. Other acids not only HCl help with stomach acid. As chosenone mentioned, SF722, caprylic acid, etc. can work (don’t do these with boulardii though), coconut oil, ACV. I would consult your ND about stomach acid also. Should help with a variety of things. -raster"
10,Waitingindreams,82,"Okay, great! Thank you for the information. Now, what would you suggest I do to have my liver function tested?"
11,raster,82,"Well a variety of people have co-infections such as h.pylori and candida together or SIBO and candida. It’s important to rule these out if you have a candida problem. The symptoms are pretty similar. As far as figuring out liver health, you should in general focus on detoxing if you are fighting against candida. The candida toxins cause die-off and you need to detox the die-off toxins out of the body in order to get better and feel good. However, if you want to test your liver health, get your liver enzymes tested to see whether they are elevated or not. -raster"
12,Waitingindreams,82,"Yes, I agree. I have suspected that I might have SIBO for awhile now, but my naturopath hasn’t tested me yet. Might need to go to a GI for that. And I will inquire about the liver enzymes as well. Thank you!"

Unfortunately, it seems as the two of you are telling me two different things. lolcandida, I appreciate a different view on the candida diet, but do you have any studies to back your claim up, or was this more of a trial/error thing you decided to try on yourself? Was it just the mindset that low carb wasn’t working for you, so you tried increasing your carbs? That’s what I gathered from your post. I am not doubting that this worked for you, I just don’t see how it could work for me. Once I went gluten free, rice and potatoes became a much bigger part of my diet than they ever were. I saw my candida get worse…although the rash is awful, it is nice to have a visual so that I can see what is working and what isn’t. I love potatoes, especially when cut up and grilled, but I learned that I had to let them go. All grains as well. I feel my candida is because of a leaky gut, due to undiagnosed celiac disease (10+ years undiagnosed) You are telling me to increase my carbs and my fruit juice intake. I am trying to keep a rather low histamine diet, so rice and potatoes would be fine…but citrus juice would not be. Also, the last time I had grapes I became rather ill. I blamed it on the natural yeast in the grapes, and I haven’t touched them since. I really don’t think your diet would help me at all, but if there were more proof in that it could work for others, I would give it a try. Also, I am following the Specific Carbhoydrate diet, which does focus on consuming carbohydrates/food that are easy to digest. It is geared toward healing all bowel diseases, and as I have celiac disease I figured it’d be a good start. Regardless, the gluten free diet has not been enough for me. Potatoes are considered too starchy for this diet, as are all grains. Also, to respond to your point on hypothyroid, the SCD diet is also apparently a great place to start for those wishing to control their hypothyroid issues, including those with Hashimoto’s. As far as I am aware, I do not have a thyroid issue…but if I do, this diet seems like the great place to start for everything. There are no studies backing up the candida diet or any diet for that matter. Studies can only last a few months and the results of diets take much longer than that to fully analyze. In coming to my conclusions about candida I reviewed the work of Ray Peat ( raypeat.com/articles ), and others who have done extensive research into hormones and the effects of carbohydrates on them. ( http://www.abioenergeticview.com/2-7 , http://www.abioenergeticview.com/4-1 ) I searched for years for the solution to candida, I tried all the low carb diets and those do not work to beat candida or hypothyroidism which the scd diet will only exacerbate. I am very confident that I can induce candida in anyone and eliminate candida in any human with diet alone. Everyone’s hormones and digestive tract works the same way. A quick look through these forums and others will show you that no one beats candida on a low carb diet. You are correct that leaky gut is a problem with candida, but the solution is to strengthen the gut lining/metabolism and you can only do this with carbohydrates. Anyone can tolerate raw honey as it is the easiest carbohydrate source to digest, fruit juice is a bit harder to digest, but is far easier than any starch like white rice or potato. You can even increase tolerance to fruit juice or fruit by consuming honey at the same time or adding an organic sugar to the juice. Your tolerances to carbs beyond raw honey will vary, but in my experience the watery and citrus fruits that lack starch are the easiest to digest. Orange juice without pulp is a good option to try after raw honey. You can get 500-1000 calories from raw honey/day more than that may be a challenge which is why I suggest fruit juices or finding a fruit that you can tolerate. You need to eat a caloric surplus to change hormones and up regulate metabolism which cures leaky gut/candida so I think a minimum of 2500 calories is probably necessary to beat candida. I ate around 4500 calories/day for over a month when beating candida of which at least 3000 was from raw honey or fruit juice everyday."
14,Waitingindreams,82,"Thank you for your detailed response. I have read many accounts that the candida diet does not work, but I have not really read anything negative against the SCD diet. So, (to reiterate to make sure I am understanding clearly) you are saying you got rid of your candida by diet alone. No probiotics, or antifungals? No digestive enzymes, etc? Honey is actually allowed on the SCD diet, but I’m not too positive about raw honey. I have a severe pollen allergy (although it seems to have gotten loads better since going low histamine, I’m not sure I’m ready to dive into this just yet, lol) I would definitely have to be cautious when introducing raw honey. I could tolerate “processed” honey just fine, though. And as for your diet, the fruit juice, starches (potatoes and white rice) and raw honey was all you ate? I don’t think I am comfortable eating a caloric content that high daily, could that be modified? As stated, I am not severely overweight apart from the bloating from my mid section, but I need to lose weight to keep my hernia in check. I can’t afford any weight gain. I gained a lot of weight when I became very sick near the diagnosis of my celiac disease, and it is finally settling down. Eating 4500 calories would be horrible! Lol. And what else could I eat? Would I have to give up my regular diet as it is now…grilled vegetables and chicken? Salad with ACV/olive oil? Would this have to be ALL that I eat, or could it be in addition to my current diet? I’ve never heard of anything like this. And how are you doing now, are you back on a regular diet? My plan was to stay on a version of the SCD diet indefinitely, and then have a cheat day once a week (within reason) so that I could eat hummus, rice, etc again. How is your diet now? How bad was your candida when you started? Mine seems to just be the rash under the breast and under the arms, but I feel I must have it in my intestines as well."

So a bit of background – i’ve been ill for many years with on/off stomach problems, headaches, general unwell etc. I finally found a doctor that diagnosed me with candida. Ive been sticking to the diet for around 5 weeks and then a few days ago I went through a pretty bad point in my life (bad breakup) and cheated (well actually i’ll call it what it is…a binge!) for a few days on everything that i shouldn’t and more!! safe to say that right now i’m so annoyed, ashamed and embarrassed. What i want to know is if i’ve undone all my work and is there anything I can do to reverse the damage? Also i’m going back to my doctor next week and i really don’t want to have to admit what i did but feel that i should! Thanks for any input you might have on this!! x"

It’s awful, my jaw aches, my head tingles, my little finger on my left hand has now started to tingle too it’s just so scary. After 8 days I had a couple of good days and thought I was through the worst, that was until today and bam, all the awful head feelings and nausea have returned and worse. I also feel very anxious and depressed today and starting to think this may be not be candida but something much worse if you know what I mean. Please someone tell me this is good and keep going as I am feeling like its all too much and I should just go back to my normal diet. My life is boring, I eat boring food and constantly pop pills.

If you dont feel like keeping up the diet for the long haul, just know that it is not the only way to get better.

3,Doggiemama,84,"well the first two weeks of the diet, i was ready to give up..or blow my head off (Well not really but felt that way) i HATED the diet, i hated what i had to eat and could no longer eat, i had ZERO energy. walking across the room was the hardest thing to do. i stayed hidden in my house,..either sleeping or researching. then after about 3-4 weeks in..i felt great..for two weeks..then i started feeling bad again. now two..going on three months now. now i am up and down. one day good..next day not so good. but i seem to be doing slightly better. today i thought..OMG, i cant eat like this forever..this is crazy. then i thought..i wont have too but i will always have to watch what i eat and how much. that i will have to limit myself on sweets, breads,starches..etc. and that i will always have to take some form of pills..being probiotics, digestive enzymes and probably coconut oil. anyway, i cant think that far ahead or it depresses the hell out of me..so for today, i figure out my plan of whats on the menu..and go from there. as i was saying to someone earlier..this is the worst diet in the world to be on…but the outcome has to be much greater. Fewer Drs to see, less meds to take, and i will be able to function better in society. this is very debilitating so anything is better than this..whatever the sacrifice may be…i will do it. and i know how very hard it is. i struggle in my mind everyday. it will get better…it just takes time and effort and try to not think too far ahead. take it one day at a time..cause if you dont..it can overwhelm you."

CHRIS24, can you explain your comment to me please? Treating severe candida overgrowth cases with a starvation/probiotic/antifungal protocol is very inefficient because the candida colonies in the colon wont give way easy, and everything thrown at it mostly gets absorbed into the blood before it can come into contact with the candida. Only light cases can cure themselves in the short run in my opinion. But we often confuse symptom reduction with curing. That is not the case, the candida can lay dorment in the colon for a long time, and then, when we make a little mistake suddenly cause a huge relapse. So, im talking about enema’s as a quick way to get rid of the core of our health problems. Especially for moderate to severe cases a common candida protocol as the one on this site and well, all over the internet, is a slow grinding, inefficient process. The many accounts of relapse, the return of symptoms throughout, the lack of succes stories, and the timeline up to 18 months are testimonies to this."

CHRIS24, can you explain your comment to me please? Hello, D.M. As you know, our protocol (the one you’re following) is completely different from the protocol that Chris described, and for good reason. The is a quote from statements made by various research journals concerning Candida and the intestines: “The intestines play a role in a variety of health disorders which is why the intestines are the focus of numerous scientific studies concerning these various disorders and illnesses. In the case of a Candida overgrowth, for example, science labs and university studies readily point to the digestive tract as being the stronghold from which the organism gains a foothold in the body.” End quote. The “digestive tract” includes: •	mouth •	esophagus •	stomach •	pancreas •	gall bladder •	liver •	small intestine •	large intestine •	rectum After more than two years of constant research and experience, at least 1 ½ years of which were spent suffering and experimenting on my own body through a Candida overgrowth, I experienced a cure through the protocol and the ‘stricter’ Candida diet. Other members of the forum have testified to this as well. Although it was not my experience, it is my belief that using a Nystatin antifungal enema in the beginning of the protocol as part of the cleanse as well as one or two spaced two weeks a part near the end of the first stage could be beneficial in clearing out some of the dying as well as living Candida. However, no one has offered proof that the enemas, even with a Candida diet, used from the beginning to end can cure a full-blown Candida infestation. Keep in mind that if probiotics are added to the enema protocol, then this is a different situation from using only the enemas and diet. However, I believe that an enema used every week could be detrimental in the long run because of the beneficial bacteria being expelled along with the enema Able"

0,Sarita,85,"Hi, I need advice. I’ve been following Linda Allen’s Yeast Infection No More program. I’ve done all the detoxes and cleanses and now I’m at the antifungal stage. I’m confused about this stage because she recommends taking only 1 antifungal at a time for 2-3 weeks, then take a 2 week break, then rotate to another antifungal and then continue doing antifungals for no more than 8 weeks total (so I’m assuming if you include the breaks this would be a 16 week plan). I’m wondering if one of you pros could look at the following schedule I’ve created and let me know what to change. Should I be taking the 2 week breaks in between? Why? This is my plan which includes probiotics before breakfast and dinner and Candizyme at bedtime : week 1  1-2 drops of oregano oil for lunch (also using 1-2 tablespoons of coconut oil on salads every day) week 2  3-4 drops of oregano oil for lunch week 3 break from antifungals except natural stuff like coconut oil week 4  break week 5 1000-1500mg olive leaf extract week 6 1500-2000mg olive leaf extract week 7  break week 8 break …and so on and I’ll switch out to caprylic acid next and then go back to oregano oil at the end. I’ll be taking Candizyme the whole time and once the 16 weeks is over I’ll take SF-722 for about a month. Does this sound legit?? Thanks in advance."

So, will it still kill my intestinal candida? Although the bottle says to “swish and swallow” I’m not doing that because I want as much of it as possible to go straight to my intestines!

If I remember correctly, Dvjorge here who recommends nystatin both orally and via enemas, he says without sucrose is better, but because nystatin is such a powerful antifungal, the sucrose probably won’t feed them much.  It’s like giving us our favorite food but with cyanide in it. It will kill them faster than they can eat the sucrose.  The only thing I’d be worried about would be feeding other organisms, like bad bacteria or parasites.

0,nate99,88,"Hello, Pretty soon I’m going to start the diet. More than a year ago I gave kind of a half attempt at it. I noticed that the lack of fiber really affected me. Going to the bathroom was often not a pleasant experience. I usually eat quite a lot of fiber during the day from fruit, mainly apples. Even when using psylium husks, it still wasn’t very pleasant. I’m wondering if I can eat the leftover pulp from use of my masticating juicer? If you don’t know what that is, the juicer uses a slow and powerful motion to crush fruits and vegetables that go through it. It supposedly crushes all of the cell walls letting the water and sugar and vitamins and minerals out while expelling the fibrous pulp. My idea was to eat the pulp and just throw away the juice, or give it away to someone. Theoretically, the pulp has no sugar and is pretty much just fiber. However, I doubt I can ever be fully sure it is sugar free. Maybe I would use water and strain it again before eating it. Anyway, just trying to think creatively to keep my bowels moving regularly. Thanks for any help, N"
1,nicole13,88,"Fruit pulp would but be a good idea. You get plenty of fiber from veggies but you should also look into a powdered fiber supplement. I use renew life organic triple fiber- flaxseed, oat bran acacia. It’s sugar free and contains soluble an insoluble fiber."

0,surfside949,91,"Hi… Okay, here it goes… I am probably living proof of reading too much information on the internet and I wish there was a place we could go to for one answer and one “common sense” approach to Candida… after all, we all have unique bodies and each one of us arrived in this place due to many different contributing factors. MY GOAL:  I hope to resource this forum because like most of you, this is driving me CrAzY!!!! On the other hand, compared to some of the other stories I am reading about, my symptoms seem to be minimal in scale however, still extremely MAJOR on a personal level. In order to reach a better understanding of what I am dealing with, I am reaching out for help and asking that you please read the following bullet points which should provide a timeline of symptoms and history. I sincerely your participation and welcome any advice from anyone that has the time to share. More over, I truly welcome a QUICK solution to this mess so I can get my life back. On that note; after reading a post by one blogger stating; “a massive dose of WIld Oregano Oil eradicated Candida out of her in only three days,” I am wondering if this is TRUE OR FALSE? Evidentially, she was going on vacation and needed a quick cure and posted because she had good luck and her symptoms have not returned… Hmmmm?? A LITTLE HISTORY… * I am 47 & started smelling a very foul fishy odor “down below” in the “V” area back in Dec. ‘2013 * No discharge or itch and the odor only emitted throughout the early morning… Upon which, I run to the shower! * Sept. ‘2013 – I was EXPOSED & INHALED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MOLD… yes, I was up close & personal with actual mold & airborne spores in the house I moved into * I became really sick for next several months suffering fatigue, major sinus infections and just felt like “s – – t” all the time! * At this point in my life, I realized my immune system is down due to an extreme life transition… I am out of work after 14 years in the medical industry, had to move home, have no income at all, struggling with emotions and feeling lost in life * To make matters worse, my mattress, box spring and bed frame were also loaded with mold and after exposure, for the next 5 months, I retreated to this bedroom for rest and sleep which happen to be a death trap. (Bed was replaced in May ‘2014) * I also went back on birth control and take antacids on a semi-regular basis * My diet is not extremely bad & consider it to be well rounded. My diet is not extreme in any direction and have always enjoyed whatever I wanted (in moderation) which included; white flour products, wheat, carbs, lots of cheese, meat, chicken, some fish, salads, veggies, apples, ice cream (1/2 the fat), sherbet, yogurt (non-fat vanilla), granola, some nuts (pepitas, sunflower, almonds), RED wine and tons of milk. Most everything I buy is non-fat, I never used to be big on vitamins, my water intake is good & my health is generally in great shape. HEALTH:  Aside from the chronic sinus issues I was experiencing, I felt generally okay. I knew the stress and life situation had me down but, still maintained walking and tried to get a good nights rest. I am not overweight, maintain low/average blood pressure (even after fast pace walking) and luckily, low cholesterol. I never dreamed my issues were environmental due to toxic mold exposure and based on all the symptoms, I was treated with antibiotics for chronic sinus infections which, evidentially, added to this “perfect storm” for yeast overgrowth. Thankfully, the pharmasist noticed the long list of medications and suggested my issues might be environmental?? WOW… what a lifesaver! ANTIBIOTIC USAGE:  * I was on several strong ANTIBIOTICS to include: Penicillin (2 rounds), Augmentin (2 rounds), Erythromycinn (2 rounds), Amoxicillin (2 rounds), Flaygyl, Fluconazole anti Yeast Pill 4 times, Miconazole anti-fungal gel 2 times AND three months of high quality probiotics MEDICAL TESTING DUE TO ODOR: * The Dr tested me for every STD out there including BV and thankfully, everything came up NEGATIVE… she continued to treat for yeast which helped a little but, I am still not feeling completely fresh or anything like my old self at all UGH! I began researching my symptoms and I THINK, I am dealing with “CANDIDA?” After doing lots of research, I decided to following a simple routine and on a scale of 0 – 10, my symptoms might be around a 3 compared to what it was in December. I Still have odor in the morning and want my body in balance again. HERBAL REGIMENT: (all supplement tablets) * I did not cleanse however, I plan to include “Pau d’arco” to my regiment starting tomorrow * Coconut Oil Supplement 4000mg (all good & effective for Candida relief) * Caprlyic Acid 1460 mg (anti fungal) * Grapefruit Seed 1000 mg (parasite remover, anti bacteria & anti fungal) * Chelated Molybdenum 600 mcg (to remove toxins from liver) * Probiotic 50 billion – formulated for vaginal care According to what I have read, due to the Candida’s ability to acclimate to anti-fungals, I am alternating from Caprlyic Acid & Grapefruit Seed… ADDING THE FOLLOWING:  * Wild Oil of Oregano (not sure of dosage and not sure if its better to take in oil form or supplement?) * Black Walnut Oil (” “) * Pau d’arco – tea form is supposed to be best? cleansing agent, anti-fungal, immune system booster, similar to a mild cleansing detox  agent & will help loosen stool DIET:  * Restricting all Dairy, Cheese & Milk except for: eggs, cottage cheese & plain yogurt (I have read those are okay)  * Have basically gone on Atkins style diet & only eating veggies, salads & meat… ugh!  * Drinking LOTS of water, haven’t had any wine or, any Lates for that matter * no salad dressings, sauces or flavoring… is Apple Cider okay in a salad dressing or, only Braggs? In conclusion, THIS IS WAR & NEED HELP! This is so extreme and I get it however, I can’t deal with the lack food enjoyment or lifestyle. After absorbing as much information as possible, I have a better understanding of how the Candida root grows and even how it can adapt to this regiment which is required in order to starve & eliminate it! Yes, its driving me CrAzY!! However, based on the research I have read and after reading hundreds of personal stories, I am hoping I am on the right track but , need some reality so I can balance this out. Bottom line; I hate living like this but, I can’t live with Candida either! I want my flora back and I am desperate to feel fresh and confident again. Note Re; antibiotic usage: Being that I was in the medical industry, I was exposed me to many bacterial bugs & viruses. in fact, back in ‘2011, I was on long list of antibiotics for several months and NEVER experienced this “issue” before. Which is why, considering the environmental toxins I was exposed to, it seems my body served as the perfect host by offering this thing a perfect place for the mold spores (fungus) to manifest and grow. As I previously stated, due to the combination of diet, birth control pills, antacids and massive intake of antibiotics, is this Candida yeast overgrowth and can I do anything else to help conquer this QUICKLY? HOW EXTREME IS EXTREME OR, IS THERE A BALANCE? CONCERNS, QUESTIONS & CONTROVERSIES: “TRUE OR FALSE?”  (please copy & paste to answer back) 1.) I read that our intestinal PH needs to be ACIDIC in order kill Candida but, I have also read, ALKALINE is best? Acidic makes sense  to me and looking for clarification? 2.) I am craving and need milk… I was raised on milk and really enjoy a cold glass of Non-Fat milk. I have read milk is a “NO-NO” and yet, I  have also read, WHOLE FAT MILK on a minimal intake is okay? Also, “ALMOND” MILK is okay? ORGANIC ONLY? 3.) If milk is not okay, why is cottage cheese or sour cream allowed? 3.) If an Acidic environment is ideal then why isn’t caffeine / espresso acceptable….I am dying for a Late and wondering if this is possible? 4.) When eating MEAT, CHICKEN OR EGGS, is it NECESSARY to be COMPLETELY ORGANIC? 5.) Re; PASTA: Is 100% whole wheat pasta acceptable at some point or is there an alternative? 6.) Re; RICE: I read brown sprouted rice or red rice is okay? 7.) Re; WINE: red wine is supposed to act as an antioxidant and wondering if this can be enjoyed on occasion? 8.) Re; BUTTER: Real butter versus using Country Crock? Also, what about spray olive oil?  9.) Re; Chlorine in tap water… if I make iced tea, I generally boil a pot of tap water & wondered if this should be filtered bottled water instead? I feel there has been a lot to gain from all this information and in fact; after being on the above mentioned supplements, my head & sinuses have never felt better which might actually be due to the Grapefruit Seed… I welcome any advice and if there is a way to eradicate this out of me in a fast way, please advise… This regiment seems so extreme and after researching this, I am afraid to eat anything! By the way, it’s Friday night and I would love to have a glass of wine and enjoy one of my favorite meals… how backwards will it set me in the treatment if you indulge one night? After hearing back from this forum, I am hoping to incorporate some reality into my diet and beat this thing. However, I can already advise that if anyone is fighting this in a similar manner, here are some things you might like to know: So far, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND: using & staying on the following before, during and even a little after treatment: > Chelated Molybdenum *cleanses toxins from liver & facilitates cleansing from Candida die-off > Pau d’arco *minor cleansing affect & loosens stool… will help with bowel movements & easily rid waste… may help to relieve constipation > using GREEN CHILI VERDE SALSA for extra fun flavor on salads, fish etc… Trader Joe’s has one and does not contain vinegar, sugar or anything else that will interfere with diet…. Please advise if you found anything fun to add to this regiment. THANK YOU!! Mess at the beach~"
1,raster,91,"1) pH should be acidic in stomach and digestive track but rest of body should be neutral pH. Most people with CRC (candida related complex) have lack of stomach acid which causes lots of bad bugs to grow. 2)No milk but if you occasionally have it, not a big deal but try to drink antibiotic free milk. Almond milk only ok if you make it fresh and soak the nuts first, otherwise the store bought stuff is too high in molds. 3)At first I would try to avoid dairy but in time I would introduce it. 4)Antibiotic and hormone free meat is what matters most, you don’t want the antibiotics to destroy your beneficial bacteria. 5)Buckwheat and rice pasta is alternative but keep in mind that the tomato sauce you put on it has a ton of sugar which benefits the yeast (25+ g of sugar per cup of tomato sauce is very high). 6)I would try to introduce rice later in your treatment and start out strict. Buckwheat groats are a good rice replacement. 7)I would focus on healing first and not damaging your liver and body…wine is something I would avoid for as long as possible. I personally didn’t drink alcohol for 2 years on the diet. 8)Butter is ok occasionally in low quantites but would generally avoid. 9)I would worry about fluoride more than chlorine, but filtered/spring/pure/mineral water is always healthiest My main concern is the amount of antifungals you are consuming. The antifungals will not cure you and only kill the yeast. The yeast will survive either way. When the yeast dies it produces toxins that damage your liver.

2,surfside949,91,"Thank you & sincerely appreciate the information!! I made notes & heading to the store! I never knew you could make your own Almond milk & will be an adventure for sure… Re; toxins & detox, I am really worried about that too and even more so, “die off” affects… I learned from one of the Candida sites about “Chelated Molybdenum” & “Pau d’arco” and thought they were a smart thing to add. This gets really expensive and wish there was some sort of shot a Physician could provide! haha! Evidentially, Molybdenum is used by Chemo patients by cleansing liver & removing toxins and stronger than Milk Thistle… Pau d’arco is supposed to act as a mild “cleansing” agent and loosing stool to rid waste. Used in combination, I hope they will serve to detox as I go through this. I also read one study promoting the Molybdenum to take three days prior to starting this regiment to prepare body which also sounded smart… BTW: any news or information as to ACUPUNCTURE in order to cure this? Acupuncture has proved to heal so many things and wondering if this has been explored? Google, Google, Google!"
3,raster,91,"I’ve used acupuncture for the last 4 years, the main thing it does is help rebalance your body and detox. It shouldn’t be used to fight candida but just improve your overall health. The pau d’arco is also antifungal so it can cause die-off also. Milk thistle is what I recommend. Chelated molybdenum is a chelating agent so it will remove some beneficial minerals from the body. Use it only during the die-off period if possible. -raster"
4,surfside949,91,"Thank you!! I read up on the benefits of Acupuncture last night and can see it would be very helpful for relief as we go through treatment. According the recommendations, one would have to go to a specialist, a “licensed Acupuncturist” that specializes in CANDIDA. I found a few within a 20 mile radius and looking into pricing… Evidentially, it has tremendous positive affects because Acupuncture treats the spleen & kidneys which help to eliminate toxins and relieve issues. There is a lot more to it but, like you said, its all about “over all health.” Just a little note on: Pau d’arco. In its tea form, this acts as a mild detox cleansing agent in the colon. It loosens stool and helps to eliminate waste from the body. I have not added this to my regiment yet but will be starting today (day 11). Being that I jumped into a pretty aggressive anti-fungal routine, I found that after a few days, I noticed my stool hardening up which seems to indicate a good sign & getting rid of all the bad stuff. Based on the intense research I have absorbed to almost an obsession, I decided to cross reference and research every little thing so I wouldn’t waste money and strived to spend money wisely towards healing products. Being that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of things we can add to our diets to help combat Candida, I personally only want to use the most aggressive and proven ones. On another note, I also confirmed that while, Milk Thistle is a very helpful cleansing agent for the liver, Molybdenum, as referenced in “The Candida Diet,” is much stronger and more effective for the “die off” waste… in particular, Acetaldehyde. I found the mineral, MOLYBDENUM, supported and documented by Physicians on in several sites and as we have learned, the toxin released during die off, ACETALDEHYDE, is extremely dangerous and will NOT excrete from the body like other waste. Molybdenum has proven to be the only mineral that will help to convert Acetaldehyde into acetic acid which facilitates the excretion process… it seems like a smart thing to take?? Molybdenum has been documented to be a tremendous help in relieving “flu like symptoms” caused by die off. On a personal note; I am on day 11 and have not experienced any of the horrifying symptoms (yet) and have to attribute this to Molybdenum. In fact, one Physician suggested taking this three times a day for three days PRIOP to detox or cleansing to prepare the body and if this is one of the detoxing agents recommended for Chemo patients, I have to believe, it will be a tremendous tool for Candida waste. I am looking for the fastest, safest way to rid this from my body so I can resume a normal life… and enjoy a glass of vino! HaHa!! I don’t want to compare Candida to any of the devastating and sometimes tragic diseases out there but, admittedly, I feel completely frustrated because unlike most illnesses, this cannot be treated with surgery, laser or by any other means modern medicine has to offer. I feel like this is some sort of punishment but, it has to be one of the most personal things I have ever dealt with and had to keep hidden / private. It’s not like I can chat about this with just anyone and is why I am especially so very grateful for this forum. By the way, I have never been a big fan of dieting to begin with so this is a HUGE challenge and commitment. Most especially, not being able to enjoy a glass of Cabernet while watching the sunset which, aside from my dog, is one of my MOST favorites joys! By the way, I am not an alcoholic by any means and I don’t even drink on a daily basis or over indulge but, I figured “if and when” I was ever blessed with pregnancy would be when I gave it all up… well, this is one way to practice I guess! HaHa! Speaking of which, I also gave up birth control due to the estrogen and hoping all of these contributing factors will help in the long run. I am also adding Ceylon Cinnamon Tea into my daily routine… Its supposed to have amazing properties to help combat Candida. Yes, I am very frustrated, desperate and especially when I consider all the things I used to enjoy… for what? YEAST? To me, this Candida condition is insane and when I really think about it, this has to be one of the most creepy things that can just simply take root and make a home in my body! THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER ANSWER. Apologies for if my response or post sounds a bit aggressive but I have to admit, I am mad. I am darn mad and can’t believe that on top of all the other stress and life issues I am dealing with, I feel horrible, dirty and embarrassed about my body due to Candida. Well, I want to thank you again and will update soon regarding regiment. I am going shopping today and plan to make a few of these great recipes… will be making bone broth for sure and looking for a desert alternative. I have been enjoying Sugar Free Popsicles which are made with Aspartame but, not sure if thats such a smart thing? Hoping for alternatives… Thanks & have a great day!"
5,Birke,91,"I totally symathize!!! Equally distraught! I had this – knowingly – 20 years ago, followed Elaine Gottschall’s book ‘Breaking the Vicious Cycle’, found nothing enjoyable left to eat, went from 52 to 45 kilos and my body image suffered tremendously. My marriage was on the blink already so it had probably been brought on by the stress. At some stage I decided I could not cope and just pigged right out, eating all the foods I’d had before (I had already been on a pretty safe diet, no sugar, wholemeal bread etc when I knew but a fraction of what I know now about nutrition.) I put my weight back on and lived. The last few years have taken another stress toll – I don’t do spirits, ciggys, antibiotics, prescription drugs, but I think stress alone is perfectly enough. I’m tired, irritable, anxious, have IBS symptoms that can be very annoying, brain fag, concentration issues, crawling in the head and occasional dizzies (mild enough so I can do anything but still very unsettling). My practitioner worked on self sabotage, not allowing myself to enjoy my food and put me on easy to digest stuff I hadn’t touched since I was 27 years old (I’m a rather sprightly and active 63year old). Backfired badly. I just found Linda’s site and ordered her book, considering maybe a colonoscopy for clarification, and then the Candida diet. Now I’m very worried because what we are meant to need for good health is now heavily curtailed, where do you draw the line? Alkaline bodies stay healthy – we need as many different nutrients as possible – I’m not huge on green leafies but love fruit, now that’s out – butter -grass-fed/organic- is now a health food and petite ones like me should tuck in but it’s dairy (I looooove cheese but already sacrificed that except for goats feta) – the list goes on. Basically I need to put on 3 – 4 kilos to reclaim my relative voluptiousness so I can like myself again in the mirror, but I’m at a loss how to do that on the diet. Besides, not a keen cook. Also moving home, contents, three horses and a cat from 36 acres onto a new block next month so more stress still! Pretending it’s not happening ain’t the answer. I could put on weight easily on foods normally considered healthy – such a sourdough rye bread with gouda cheese and lettuce/tomato… but then the symptoms get worse. I may not have been much help this time around, just had to let off steam, but it actually helped me reading your story (we’re not alone) and psychologically a support group of sorts is hugely important. Our friends are not that interested. Every time you contact your practitioner, you pay. It gets expensive. All we want to do is be healthy and function! And now there’s a danger: if you get well as a member of the post natal depression group or any other, ‘you’re out’ and alone again. We must safeguard getting subconsciously addicted to our problem so we have a realistic chance of getting over it! Mow, what’s for lunch??? 🙁"

0,princeofsin,93,Anyone ever tried one for candida because I am thinking about it since my friend got great results according to him.
1,Chris24,93,"Wouldnt do coffee. Heard it a couple of times on this forum and was never recommended. Coffee is not going to kill the candida colonies. Why not try a nystatin enema (powder disolved in water), or a water purifier as an enema?"
2,princeofsin,93,I wasn’t aware of that. When I looked online I saw a lot of praise about the coffee enema but I will give what you suggested a shot instead. My question is will coffee do anything?

My question is will coffee do anything? Was the praise in conjunction with candida? I can imagine it would give you an awesome bowel movement, but i havent tried it so i cant really say. However, it is said the mold and the caffeine in coffee would do more harm than good. How bad it is is difficult to say, but you wont clear up candida with it. The point of the enema in our case is to find a quicker way to the colon where the candida colonies thrive, and to let it come into contact with an anti fungal/anti pathogen liquid substance. Because having to go through the stomach and small intestine first is not very efficient."
4,Able900,93,"When you take an enema containing coffee (or any other liquid) it is absorbed into the blood stream. This has the same effect as it would if it were rubbed on the skin or taken by mouth. When you take coffee or another caffeine product into your body in any way, the caffeine will work towards weakening the adrenals which leads to increased inflammation in the body due to low levels of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids. As far as Candida is concerned, it becomes more difficult for the healing process to be successful when the adrenals are weak. In addition, the tannins in coffee can bind together nutrients which are desperately needed for healing. In addition to this, the oxalates in coffee irritate the body tissues. But the most important of these is the weakening of the adrenals and therefore the immune system which in most cases is already suffering due to the Candida infestation. Flora (colonies of beneficial bacteria): Keep in mind that the tannins in the coffee have the ability to kill the flora, which will actually increase the absorption of toxins from the colon since one of the roles of the flora is to break down toxins for excretion. You can’t cure a Candida infestation without sufficient flora in the intestines. Beneficial bacteria in your colon will maintain the health of the colon because the good bacteria are able to keep dangerous bacteria from multiplying and also reduce the occurrence of constipation. An occasional enema containing Nystatin is more likely to be beneficial to your treatment than coffee which would only prove in the long run to be detrimental to your cause. Able"

Second, Able DID do his research, hence why he came up with such a well-written and detailed post. Everything he wrote is of concern for people who have candida, and there is way more evidence to support his information than yours. Coffee is a stimulant and an irritant. Just because it works for some folks doesn’t mean it’ll work for everyone. I, like many others on here have an irritated gut lining and it will do no good for me. Coffee burns out your adrenals and causes unneeded stress for your body when you’re trying to heal. In some people, it may help the liver, but when you’re suffering badly like me and many others on here, it’ll do more harm than good.

The recipe called for 1 1/4 cups. She said she always made this to have on hand in her fridge for recipes. Soooo, I bought a bunch of avocados and now realize I don’t have the recipe. Does anyone recognize this recipe from what I have remembered of it? Does anyone else use this mix in recipes? I am brand new here, and appreciate this blog so much! Thanks for any responses!"

0,kalexandr,95,"I am having it for more than a year. Taking oregano oil 5 drops 2 times a day, liquorice powder 3 times a day, and Lactobacilius and Bifidus probiotic. Three times a day I drink fennel and aniseed powder tea. These have been recommended to me by a great indian yogi and ayurvedic doctor. Can you guys recommend me a good probiotic containing these bacteria? I live now in the US from 1 month and dont know what to buy. Nature remedies I am taking for 10 months for now and I feel much better, but I am not cured yet. I cannot put on weight, feel diziness after drinking coffee, eating bananas – it seems candida is still here. I wasnt able to do any excercise before, but now I do everyday pushups, biking, pullups, swimming. I think I should probably stop coffee, fruits and etc., but haven’t done it yet. Can you guys give me your personal opinion about my case and also recommend me a probiotic? Alex"
1,raster,95,I would try out HMF neuro which is the only human derived probiotic on the market in the US… -raster

0,JBuffington,96,"I found out that I had a Candida overgrowth at the end of June; using online research and an at home saliva test. Since then I have been on the Candida diet and taking several supplements including Yeast-Cleanse by Solaray. I am on the second bottle of it now. This product contains: caprylic acid, Pau D’Arco, grapefruit seed extract,tea tree oil and several vitamins and minerals. Here is a website that lists the ingredients: http://www.drugstore.com/solaray-yeast-cleanse/qxp191334 How many rounds of this product is safe to take? Please give me your suggestions. Thanks for all your help and advice. JB"
1,nicole13,96,Sounds like it had a lot of good candida fighting stuff but I know that candida can adapt to all anti fun gals except coconut oil and garlic ( I think those are the only two). So maybe relying on this alone may not be a good idea. I took coconut oil band garlic daily and rotated my other anti fun gals like game and coconut oil every two weeks .
0,PandaRai,97,"Hey guys! I first off want to thank everyone for all their hard work they’ve put into this forum, I’ve been reading it a lot the past few days and I’ve learned so much. I have tried to search for posts about this but couldn’t find any :s My backstory: In early 2011 I finally discovered I was suffering for the past 3 years from a candida overgrowth, I did the cleanse and diet and got back on track and did phenomenal until two months ago when everything in my life just turned upside down. I ended up eating almost nothing but gluten, sugary food and fruit for two-three months straight from all the stress and developed an overgrowth again. On Monday July 20th I went to my doctor and he put me on Diflucan for two days straight and I started the diet on the 21st. I didn’t do the cleanse as last time I did that I felt way too terrible so I just went straight to the strict diet. I’m currently still taking my vitamins that I was taking every day which are Vitamin D3, B12, Garlinase, Ginko, Fish Oil, and a multi-vitamin. I’ve also added in a probiotic pill in the morning and I started Solaray’s Yeast-Cleanse (close to what they suggest on the main site but I know people on here say it may not be good so I will switch when bottle of done) on Sunday the 27th. I was taking Oil of Oregano but I found out that can inhibit your iron intake so I stopped that. I’m on birth control so my cycle should be set, my last one started on the 12th of July and then I started again on the 30th of July, I shouldn’t be starting for another 1.5 weeks. I don’t remember this happening the first time I did the cleanse, granted then I wasn’t taking vitamins regularly or really taking a solid antifungal/probiotic as I wasn’t aware of them, and it was so long ago. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced this and kinda just curious as to how this happened. I wouldn’t think just changing your diet could affect your hormones in this sort of way, but I’m no expert. It’s just making it hard to tell what is period pain, candida pain, etc etc. Thank you for your time, I hope you have a wonderful and blessed day 🙂"
1,nicole13,97,Changing your diet will certainly have an influence on your hormones and your cycle. I hate to say this but you should really consider coming off of the pill. I myself was on the pill for years. When I started the cleanse I ditched the pills along will all of the other meds I took. I started having normal cycles after a month of being on the diet..pill free! 🙂 A lot of times when you have candida you also have adrenal burnout so your hormones are already thrown off. Hope this helps.
0,mash2100,98,"I’ve been taking inulin along with probiotic and antifungal pills for the past several weeks now. However, after reading this post (http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst7012_Inulin—–Stop-taking-it.aspx), I’m not so sure I should be taking it anymore. I don’t feel like I’ve had a negative reaction towards inulin which brings up my question: If I’m taking 2-3 probiotic pills (30 bil CFUs each) a day and take a teaspoon of inulin along with each pill, wouldn’t the good bacteria get to the inulin first and feed off of it before the yeast can?"
0,HeatherJ,99,"So, I tried Nystatin hoping it would be an anti-fungal I could use for a long period of time. The only form we have here in NL is the syrup…the really sweet syrup. I tried it, hoping it would work out. I stuck to the diet but you can guess what happened. I can always measure the degree of Candida infestation by my toes: when the Candida takes over my toes develop what I once thought was callouss. I now know it is Candida. So, my toes got white, my nails got a bit crumbly and chalky and an ingrown nail began to redevelop. This was my cue to stop the syrup. Total bummer in every way. I’ve since stopped the syrup and resumed what worked for meL coconut oil and oil of oregano. After reading a lot about S Boulardii, I finally ordered a bottle from The States that is due to arrive any day. As I understand it, I need to stop with the oil of oregano and all other anti-fungals. The thing is, I really like all of the other benefits of coconut oil. Do I really have to stop it? Thanks and hope everyone is enjoying their summer."

1,MrNorth,100,"Hey, Folate is the naturally-occurring form of the vitamin. Folic acid is the synthetic counterpart to folate. I think folacin is same than folic acid. Not sure. I am consuming methylfolate daily. This is because I have so called C677T MTHFR (1 copy) gene mutation which is the reason I am not converting very folic acid to folate very efficiently. Methylfolate or L-methylfolate is the form you can directly utilize without convertion. There’s a web page: http://www.deplin.com/folate-for-depression/ I think if someone hasn’t got C677T MTHFR gene mutation, they should be able to convert folic acid quite easily. /MrNorth"
0,wannabhealthy,101,"Hi there, I am wondering how to get started with figuring out if I have candida. These are my symptoms & a description of my current diet. I get sick on average 2 times a month and each time it lasts 7-12 days. This has been happening since I had an emergency c-section 2 years ago. (Someone told me they pump tons of antibiotics into you when you have a c-section and that could have created the problems). Every time I get sick it starts with a night sweat, low grade fever, chills, extreme headache and then the next morning I wake up with extreme congestion. The congestion feels like a sinus infection lots of pain behind the forehead & eyes. I feel sort of out of it, a little weak and start coughing about 2-3 days later. They ran all kinds of blood tests for me recently at kaiser and found nothing wrong. Except a mild allergy to ragweed and now I take flonase for that. In the mean time, I have had horrible skin rashes that again just started after I had my little boy via emergency c-section. I have been to 3 dermatologists that can’t figure out what it is and says it doesn’t “present” itself like typical excema, psoriasis, etc. So they have recommended a biopsy. I am scheduled to go in on Tuesday of next week. I also have cut out gluten, soy, dairy and most grains. I eat a ton of fruit. Every morning a green smoothie, or gluten free cereal, almond milk and berries. I eat lots of fish & veggies too. I drink a ton of water. I snack on nuts, seeds and “lara” bars. I drink kevita, kombucha, etc. I have occasional eggs (organic from my own chickens). I love nut butters. I typically eat all organic and gmo free. When I have a sweet tooth (at night) I eat Coconut bliss (its an ice-cream substitute) and coconut based “raw” cookies. I have given up coffee and alcohol. Once in a while I might sneak in a cup / glass but usually feel worse from doing so. The caffeine makes me jittery and the alcohol gives me an instant headache. I also seem to get very mild yeast infections right before my period every month for about 3-4 days and they go away on their own. I take inner-eco probiotic and drink good belly juice. I feel completely depressed from all the problems when I try so hard to eat right and have eliminated so many types of foods. I need to exercise more it helps me so much mentally but I can’t stay in routine with all of this going on. I take a multi vitamin, wellness formula, herbal immunity tincture, golden seal- echinacea daily. I even did some acupuncture the other day, I will try anything! I want to have more energy for my kids and instead I constantly feel weighed down, headachy, etc. I am grateful to whoever might be able to point me in the direction of getting started on a path to healing. I welcome any advice."
1,Aus084,101,"Hi there, I am new here also and started my diet last week so don’t have a lot of answers but I can tell you what I did/will be doing. I had done a few online tests that pointed towards candida overgrowth and then did the morning saliva test which confirmed it. I had been to three doctors that have given me antibiotics to treat my ongoing uti’s. I have only gotten worse. I am off to see a naturopath next week as I have heard they treat so many people with candida. Maybe this is an option for you?? I feel your pain as I am a mother to 3 boys (youngest 6 weeks old) and I want to be able to enjoy them. I hope you find your path to wellness 🙂"
2,Rabelais,101,"  Take care with online tests. They are often written in such a way that the vast majority of the population would suffer from candida if you were to believe these tests. (Please let it be clear that I am NOT saying that you don’t have candida. All I’m saying is that online tests are unreliable. You should use a reliable test to find out what’s causing your complaints.) The spit test too is unreliable. You can find threads about the unreliability of the spit test on this forum, and you can find a good explanation here and here Rabelais  "
3,Kculver,101,I knew someone that had surgery and it caused candida overgrowth bc of the scar tissue. She went to health dept and the woman DR knew exactly what was going on and gave her 40 days worth of yeast infection medicine. She was very ill from them during the die off stage. I would suggest going to see a naturopath doctor. Eating sugar / fruit is feeding the yeast if that’s what you have. Best of luck
4,raster,101,"The coughing is a symptom of your body detoxing toxins. The body detoxes via 3 basic methods, via the skin, via the lungs, and via the bowels. If your liver isn’t working effectively, the you will detox via other methods such as via the lungs and via the skin. I recommend supporting your liver and detoxing and you don’t have a detox plan. Additionally the goldenseal is basically an anbibiotic which we don’t recommend here on the forum because it will destroy your beneficial gut flora. I would stop this if possible. The headache from coffee indicates inflammation of the gut and you need to eat anti-inflammatory foods and supplements in order th reduce inflamamtion. The kombucha should help do this but there is more you can do. This takes a long time to reverse from my experience. Your diet can get even stricter if you were to remove nuts and seeds, eggs, almond milk, etc. I recommend getting strict and then loosening your diet…right now your diet is more of a late treatment diet. What is in the green smoothie? You likely would feel better the stricter you get. -raster"
5,wannabhealthy,101,"Thank you all, good suggestions!"
6,Kornygirl78,101,"Hi Wannabhealthy, I am new here too. It sounds to me like you do have candida. But of course, tests would be best to figure that out. First, I would find a well-reputed nutritionist in your area. If you are anywhere near Carol Stream, IL, I can recommend a good one. Get them to test for yeast overgrowth. I saw my older sister go through years of candida. I believe she ate way too many starchy foods during those years, which produced way too much sugar – and prolonged her symptoms. I think if she was stricter on her diet, it could have been healed quicker. Anyway, many of the people I have talked to, and a nutritionist friend, state that you should have absolutely NO sugars AT ALL. That means fruit also. Yeast will take any type of sugar it can get to feed off of. NO caffeine, NO starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, carrots), NO condiments, NO chocolate, NO gluten, NO peanuts/cashews, and whatever else Candida diet restricts. You cannot play lightly with candida. You can do well, and then have something sweet and ruin your progress, and have to start over all again. Just remember, it won’t last forever! You will be normal again some day!! The more coconut products (especially coconut oil – organic, unrefined and cold-pressed) you introduce into your diet, the better. The lauric acid in it is a candida killer. I cook my eggs in it, use it instead of other oils when baking, and you can even eat a spoonful a few times a day – but be careful not to do it too much at the beginning, or your die off symptoms can get out of hand. Completely cut out all sugars, fruits, wheat flour, condiments, pre-packaged foods, etc. Basically, eggs, meats and veggies are your safest bet. It is hard to come home from work and wonder what I’m going to eat, after I make my son and husband dinner!! So, I try to have a lot of almond butter on hand, and eggs, and homemade coconut bread. I am taking an organic multi-vitamin, Primal Defense probiotics, Candida Support (NOW Foods), and I’m waiting for my probiotic to arrive in the mail. I would really focus on your diet right now, and feeding only healing, anti-inflammatory foods to your gut right. Also, take an anti-fungal like Candida Support with a probiotic (like ThreeLac) at the same time. But definitely run all of this by a nutritionist first – preferably one who has had candida – and healed themselves. I hope things work out for you!! I’m here if you need anything. I am not a pro at this – as I am new to it myself – but I’ve seen enough of candida in my sister’s life, and now my own – to know that it isn’t to be taken lightly. 🙂 God bless"
0,Spyderdog,102,"I’m 30 days into the program to treat seb dermatitis (face) I also have other candida symptoms such as a coated tongue. I started the antifungals on day 21. Had a massive flare up on day 25 which is slowly receding. Have been extremely strict, tongue is still coated, although my general health and joints are feeling good! The first week on the diet my skin cleared up extremely well but has been going backwards since then. Has anyone else treated their seb derm with the diet? Just wondering how long this is going to take. I’ve have read it can take a month for every year that you’ve had the candida infestation. I’m looking at 20 months which is a bit disheartening.  Would love the hear from anybody that may have some ideas or tips 🙂 Thanks Helen"
1,Danny33,102,"SD, I have posted a few times on treating Seb Derm. This used to be one of my worst symptoms. Whoever told you that the number of years w/ Candida = the months of treatment is wrong and very misleading. When you hear things like that, blacklist them immediately. Seb Derm is a symptom of a larger issue. Typically dysbiosis, candida, etc. I eliminated my seb derm temporarily using Candida Freedom Bar soap and further fixed it treating my candida/dysbiosis. The soap worked within hours and in 2 days 95% of my seb derm was gone. I also got Ketoconazole from my doctor that worked OK, I used it only a few times and stopped since it was far inferior to the bar soap. I can further detail this if needed, let me know. -D"
2,Spyderdog,102,"Thanks your your reply Danny33. I’ve looked up the soap and Amazon does not ship it to Australia! I haven’t been able to find anywhere (so far) that does.  When I looked up dysbiosis it is said that a diet high in fat and low in carbs contributes to this. The candida diet is low in carbs but the only fat I’m having is from coconut oil and cream. I keep beef to a minimum, and have wild salmon and skinless chicken breasts daily along with all the green vegetables that are allowed. Am I working against myself in some way? I’m having a high dose of quality probiotics along with natural antifungals.  If this is the way to go, I’m very motivated to continue, no matter how long it takes. I’ve have found that any doctor/skin specialist prescribed treatments only work in the short term, my skin seems to fight and overcome them.  Thanks again, I really appreciate it. H"
3,raster,102,"The beef could be problematic because it takes 2+ days to digest whereas fish and chicken take hours. You’ll likely feel a lot better if you removed it from your diet. I can offer more suggestions but will leave it to danny, I don’t have any seb. derm…just wanted to chime in. -raster"
4,shottot,102,"I have had seb derm for a long time now. I just recently went on the diet to try to get rid of it as well as the sporadic inflammatory acne that would crop up anywhere on my body. I seemed to notice the same thing, after about a week my skin my looking and feeling great but have seemed to reached a period of slower remission with these past weeks. Although the healing may be slow, it is still some sort of progression. I read that the condition can not be healed but truly do not believe this statement. The diet seems to be working so I plan to stick with it for as long as it takes to see if it is still beneficial to remain on it."
5,Spyderdog,102,"I’m the same shottot. I believe it can be beaten too! The next thing I’m going to add in is herbal fibreblend. That will really clean out built up bowel plaque and parasites. I used it several years ago and it really works. I think in combination with the diet it should give me a bit of a healing boost. That’s the plan anyway. From everything I’ve read cleaning out the intestines plays a huge part in getiting rid of candida there, easing the detox strain on the liver, and helping the immune system get back on track.  I’m in it for the long haul 🙂"
6,shottot,102,"wow it is nice to see someone else out there fighting the good fight with me. I agree, I am in this thing to win it. From the progress I have seen so far, there is no doubt that leaky gut, candida, or parasites are the causes of my skin conditions. My dermatologist said that seb derm is something that I will have to live with most likely for the rest of my life so I CANNOT wait to go back and show him my progress. I plan on doing pretty much the same thing that you are, after I get my body back to its proper running order I think some 7-10 day water fast will be needed, but this is just for my symptoms not everyone."

4,Henschy,103,"The reason people may react to it, and seeds in general I believe is the potentially high amount of mold on seeds and nuts and dry foods for that matter. Soaking it overnight might help removing some of the mold. When I made my own Almond butter I had organic almonds with skin that I let soak for 24+ hours and then peeled of the skin and rinsed them, then roasted them for about 30 minutes before using them, I think they were pretty safe by then, ofcourse that’s abit extreme but very effective 😛 As for it being wrong in you’r smoothie, do you feel worse after drinking it? Otherwise you probably don’t react to it, or not much atleast, still soaking it the night before might help removing some of the stress on you’r body and thus having more energy for you’r battle with the Candida. I make my own protein shake a variation of this recipe:  http://brittanyangell.com/how-to-overcome-candida-recipe-for-delicious-lime-green-juice/ But with organic Hemp protein powder, and 1 lime/lemon, make sure not to buy any bottled stuff containing addatives.

0,SingerCoach,104,"Hi, All! I have 3 silver fillings and 2 root canals. After ignoring my integrative doctor’s recommendation to have them removed, and trying to address my candida myself, I’ve finally decided to take her advice. I ignored her advice because (1) I thought it just sounded too “far out”, and (2) I didn’t have insurance and couldn’t afford it. Now I have Obamacare and can now afford her. After extensively reading about amalgams, and my over all lack of success in beating the candida, I’ve changed my mind. Will do a DMSA “push” to determine if a mercury issue exists, and then will have them removed by a holistic dentist, and will chelate naturally. I am trying to feel the best I can through this. I take EVERYTHING! Yikes. I have terrible brain fog, vaginal itching and TONS of hot flashes and night sweats. Last night I added L-glutathione and woke with very little brain fog and feeling much better over all. I also add a little strawberry jam before going to bed, because I think I just needed to slow down the die-off I have two other issues: I had stomach flu 2 weeks ago with 101 degree fever. 3 days after flu felt AMAZING. Did some research and thought raised temp may have helped kill some candida. So I invested in a SaunaFix (near infrared, not too expensive). Also recently stopped taking Zoloft for depression and candida symptoms SKYROCKETED. Again, research revealed that Zoloft is anti-microbial. Go figure. Anyway, wanted to share. I welcome your thoughts and suggestions on feeling as good as I can before I go through the amalgam removal process.  Your thoughts? Suggestions for feeling better until I start the amalgam removable?"
1,ThomasJoel2,104,"Mercury is a huge issue and likely the main reason you are sick. Do not take DMSA or any other chelator while amalgams are still in your mouth. You will get much sicker! Read this page in it’s entirety: http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/chelationnetwork/chelation-the-andy-cutler-protocol/ Join this forum and ask questions: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/frequent-dose-chelation/conversations/topics The manner in which you chelate is incredibly important and if you follow a bad protocol you run the risk of making yourself worse. I’m currently chelating with DMPS, following Cutler’s low, frequent-dose protocol and am experiencing continued progress. Brain fog has improved, emotional state has improved significantly (no longer feel hopeless), and I’m beginning to tolerate certain foods again. I no longer have to avoid fruit and starchy carbs completely. If you have any other concerns/questions let me know and I’ll do my best to help. Edit: Vitamin C, E, Magnesium all could help you feel better prior to removal. Some people have bad reactions to different supplements though, so it’s always smart to take it slow and start small when starting out."
2,Percyfaith,104,"Hi, All! …removed by a holistic dentist, … Hope you find a good one surely you have good choices out west. I went to 6 so called ‘holistic’ dentists within the state of Virginia. None of them were ‘holistic’ enough for me – mostly just marketing. After more research I decided to go to Scranton, PA to Dr. Blanche Grube who is Hal Huggins trained. She is a teacher of holistic dentistry. I think she may have an office in California too. Google her and watch all of her videos especially the informative videos the last one dealing with root canals is simple enough for a child to understand. Dr. Blanche, as they call her, is as sweet as sugar and as tough as nails. I love her! I have dental issues I am procrastinating about. I need to pull 4 root canal teeth out of 6 lifetime ones all upper teeth. Lost the other two that had to be pulled. It is tough when my family and friends are not supportive. More just my own reluctance and not wanting to face the unknown. I had fillings with amalgam and composite in almost everyone of my teeth, all got replaced overtime to update them. No dams, not detox, no protocols- I am still here and in as good a shape as I am due totally to the Grace of God. I got nice straight teeth from my Dad but weakness from my Mother. That weakness was not helped by years of sugar consumption and poor dental hygiene (I hated to floss) practice.It may be true that you should only floss the ones you want to keep. I used a water pick for a while and have done some helpful oil pulling in recent years but now I floss. It is sad that often we as humans have to have a wake up call before we are motivated to take care. I pray your dental work goes well for you!"
3,Rabelais,104,"  You may of course have your amalgams removed. It sounds like you already decided to do that. You say you read a lot. I fear you used the Internet as your main source. That’s in general a bad idea, because the Internet is full of complot theories and the like. No doubt you have encountered the infamous “smoking tooth” video. Did you also find out that this video is a fake? It’s only intended to make you believe that amalgams are highly toxic – which they are definitely not. Ask any medical professional. Listen to their advice. Or, if you really want to, listen to the Internet. But then, listen to the entire Internet. Which means you’ve got to believe in chemtrails, the dangers of HAARP, the Yeti, and so on, and so on. It’s your health. It’s your choice.  "

My doctor is highly regarded in my state for integrative health, homeopathy and naturopathy, so I’m confident in their expertise, although I will discuss your link with them. I agree completely with you: amalgam removal and chelation must be done correctly. Thanks for the resource. I’m interested in any other info on feeling as good as possible through this process. I am currently using Molybdenum (amino chelated), Milk Thistle, NAC and have purchased the SaunaFix. I also take Candex, Seraptase and L-Methionine. Any other advice would be appreciated."
8,Rabelais,104,"  Removing amalgams is not necessary at all. The only known effects of removing your amalgam fillings are negative. There has never been found any relation between the amount of amalgam fillings and the amount of mercury in the body’s organs.   Chelation is a risky procedure. You are directly interfering with delicate balances in your body. Therefore, chelation must only be done in case of a proven poisoning. Even then, it must be done under careful professional examination. Chelation is not something to play or experiment with. Even if you don’t notice it in the short term, in the long term you may experience some devastating consequences.  "

1,trlevi,105,"Unfortunately, there is no clear answer. It depends who you talk to, the severity of your disease, what stage of a diet you are on, etc. etc. To me,  pasta sounds like a defininte “NO”, but brown rice or wild rice might be ok in small amounts. But, like I said, it all depends who you talk to."
2,Henschy,105,"I would say no in general to those, there are exceptions though, like some Soba noodles made with only buckwheat flour and no other bad ingredients. Or Shirataki(miracle) noodles and shirataki rice are okay because they don’t contain anything basicly, so it’s not going to be nutritional. Most glutenfree pasta I’ve seen is made with corn and starch so obviously that’s a no, just read the ingredients and check with rasters safe food list on which flours are okay."

3,sophie,106,"We all eat carbs, whether they are in vegetables, fruit whatever. Trying to avoid carbs 100% is totally counterproductive IMO. Looking at your overall intake of sugars is the way to go. So you might be able to get away with a small amount of fruit, but you will have to balance that out by being really strict in other areas of the diet. As long as you keep your overall intake of sugars low, you should be fine."

Please read the information about adrenal fatigue as provided by the Mayo Clinic and, if you like, the Hormone Health network. You may not like what they have to say, but I would certainly heed their warnings!    Actually adrenal fatigue is recognized by many of the more enlightened medical professionals. The problem is the lab tests used to check hormone levels. They use such wide ranges that you really need to be in terrible shape to be considered to have adrenal insufficiency. The truth is that everyone has an *optimal* level for each hormone, and the lab tests fail to recognize this. Adrenal fatigue usually manifests in lower levels of several different hormones (including cortisol and the sex hormones). Although the levels might not be so low as to trigger a warning from the lab testers, they can still be well below your optimal level. If you’ve ever had hormone testing, you’ll know that some of the ranges are ridiculous (like a range of 1-12 for example), and you can experience a wide range of different energy levels while still sitting well inside those ranges. Adrenal fatigue generally falls outside of medical practice because sufferers are simply not ill enough for the doctors to care. If you show up with the flu or a broken leg they’ll treat you, but if you tell them you’ve been feeling tired for the last 5 years they’ll likely just tell you to get more sleep. I hope that helps!"
8,Floggi,106,"  This is, indeed, the theory. If the lab tests fail to find low hormone levels, then obviously something else is needed to reliably detect this so-called “adrenal fatigue”. However, no other test is known. This means that the so-called “adrenal fatigue” remains an unproven theory. Contrary to what you say, doctors really do care if someone walks in and says they’re feeling tired for the last five years. They just don’t run after one of the many unproven theories out there.  "
9,sophie,106,"Hi Floggi, I don’t think you read my post thoroughly. I completely agree with you that most people suffering from adrenal fatigue have ‘normal’ hormone levels. That’s because the ranges used by labs are so wide, so ‘normal’ has no real meaning. It is entirely possible for an individual to experience a 50% drop in many of their hormones, and still be within the lab ranges. Their MD will tell them they are fine, when they are obviously not. That’s where integrative doctors and naturopaths become useful, because they look to establish *optimal* levels of the various hormones. I hope that helps!"

0,AngelaL,107,I quite like making curries and they should be pretty much ok – just meat/veg/herbs and spices but the one ingredient I don’t see on the list of things you can eat is tomato puree – I don’t mean tomato ketchup just the puree of concentrated tomatoes. Does anyone know if this allowed? I would only use 1 tablespoon per four curries anyway …
1,Lukey,107,"Hi, I seem to personally tolerate tomato paste just fine.  I use organic TP and ad water, EVOO, cayenne, and garlic salt to flavor it. It’s acid producing and I seem to tolerate acid producing foods better than alkaline forming foods. Joe"
2,AngelaL,107,Thanks Lukey. I only use about 1 tbsp to make my base sauce which can make up to 5 curries. It makes all the difference to the taste so I wouldn’t want to leave it out.
3,Lukey,107,You’re welcome.  Tomato contains lycopene which is a beneficial anti oxidant. 🙂
0,AngelaL,108,"I tried teff for the first time yesterday – and today and I now feel dreadful – weak, sick suffering from diarrhea. Has anyone else had a similar reaction? Sadly though I like the taste and texture, it looks like something I’ll be giving a miss in the future …"
1,Paperstars,108,"I didn’t have quite the same reaction to you, but I didn’t tolerate Teff flour either as one of the gluten-free flours, including Sorghum and Quinoa which are all popular non-gluten flours. I was quite sad to find it that way too since it did seem add a nice texture and have gluten-like properties making the batter sticky when I was making pancakes. But I find adding a little rice-bran helps with that though it seems to alter the pancakes texture and the way they are cooked in a non-desirable way…but it’s still edible 🙂 I personally find I tend to not be able to tolerate some of the allowed food items on the Candida diet and yet be able to tolerate some of the restricted items, like rice and milk perfectly fine."
2,kjones02,108,"I liked the teff, too, but it doesn’t agree with me either. I can actually do quinoa, sorghum, and millet the best for me."
3,kjones02,108,Different from everyone else as well probably.
4,AngelaL,108,Thanks for the feedback. I normally stick to coconut flour and almond meal – I’ve tried buckwheat flour and though I don’t have any problems with it I don’t like the end results. It’s a shame about the teff but it made me feel so ill and kicked off my IBS to the extent that I probably won’t try it again. Having said that I used to have the same reaction to flaxseed but now I’m fine with it – as long as I soak it overnight.
5,Paperstars,108,"Another flour (kind of) I’m considering is hemp protein.

0,Gillian,109,"Yes I am frustrated. I have been fighting a battle with Candida for years. I was able to get it under control when my second child was born and was able to nurse him for over a year. I am back on the “dreaded” diet because I was terribly tired of having yeast infections. Fast forward 5 weeks on a very limited/strict candida diet and cleanse (Innovite) and I still have a low-grade yeast infection. I have been following the diet as best as I am able (no yeast, sugar, carbs and very little meat) but the die-off symptoms seem to flare up weekly. Two days ago I suffered an extreme headache (worse than beginning of the program) and today I have a runny nose and itchy skin, and of course yeast infaction. I feel like I am back in my Candida fog. As mentioned, I am following the Innovite Yeast Busters program and have noticed a very small increase in my energy level but overall I am still plagued by yeast infections and am feeling more depressed than ever (due in part to a lack of success on the diet). I really want to feel better!! My questions: 1. I have started taking Oil of Oregano pills two times a day and they seem to have wreaked havoc on my system. Any suggestions? 2. Every time I think I am eating a “yes” food I read more on the internet and am discouraged for having eaten it (ie. carrots) Is there a day-by-day diet that exists anywhere? I feel I am very knowledgable about what I can eat but I am finding contradictory information on the web. 3. Is coffee going to erase all that I have done to date? I am still craving coffee like crazy. Just one cup…??? 4. The program calls for distilled water. I have been drinking tap water as I felt I have to draw the line somewhere for what I am logically able to do. Is this setting me back? Does anyone have any advice?? Much appreciated, Gillian"
1,raster,109,"Do you have a detox plan? Here is my diet food list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx You likely won’t get better very quickly with coffee consumption because it is inflammatory and because it creates an environment that benefits the yeast (acidic pH). It also drains your adrenals which then drains your thyroid which is the most important part of your immune system. I recommend getting strict with the diet and consulting a naturopath who has treated yeast overgrowth (aka CRC candida related complex) for 20-30 years. You likely would benefit from a holistic approach that addresses healing multiple organs at the same time. Also, do you have a positive diagnosis for yeast overgrowth? For instance, if your thyroid isn’t working optimally (very possibly) then there goes your immune system basically. It might be difficult or impossible to heal if your thyroid health is compromised and you are deficient in iodine. Additionally, if you don’t detox properly, then this will damage your liver which will have to be healed seperately. If you were to address all of these organs at the same time spending hundreds of dollars per month, you likely will get better way faster. For instance, one week with a new plan that is tailored to your health problems might be the same as 1-2 months doing it yourself. I recommend checking out this post here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm52184_Alternative-methods-to-get-better-if-you-reach-a-dead-end-in-your-treatmen-raster-s-perspective.aspx#post52184 As far as water quality is concerned, if your city fluoridates, then I wouldn’t drink tap water.

6,Gillian,109,This is very helpful. Why no tomatoes though? Does it have to do with acidity? I cannot understand why my low-grade yeast infection simply will not go away.

9,raster,109,"There are a variety of supplements out there and I don’t want to suggest any specific ones because you basically need to tailor what supplements you get for your specific symptoms and health problems.

If the yeast isn’t dying then I would try out fatty acids such as SF722. If you have achy joints then you likely have mineral deficiencies. If you have brain fog you should take fatty acids that help heal your brain like flax oil. I can go on and on. -raster"
10,Gillian,109,Yikes. How did you figure it all out?
11,raster,109,"Well there is a whole alternative health system out there where they create supplements to treat various digestive and health problems. If you were to check out the brands integrative thereaputics, standard process, thorne, pure encapsulations, genestra/seroyal, etc. these are the high quality brands that naturopaths borrow from when they treat patients with various health problem. These naturopaths typically have experimented and tried out various treatments with various combinations and become quite familiar with what works best and how to best prescribe them for various health problems. This is why I don’t want to create a treatment plan for anyone because I don’t have this experience and don’t know what I am doing. For instance, I could suggest a variety of digestive health supplements but for some people it makes them worse and they might have bad reactions. Or they just don’t work because this person doesn’t have a need for this remedy or supplement. If I were to create a treatment plan, I would focus on diet, and detoxing to start out…and then you start adding in stuff as you progress. But everyone is going to be different because when they think they are ill with yeast, its typically a multi-faceted (multi-dimensional) health problem that surpasses just yeast by itself. For instance there are typically a variety of co-infections that a lot of people have when they have digestive problems such as problems with parasites, viruses, microbes…or digestive problems such as dysbiosis, not absorbing nutrients, etc. or various organs that aren’t working properly such as galbladder, liver, kidneys, pancreas…I can go on and on. I’m just trying to get you see the big picture and how there isn’t a one single way for everyone to get better. -raster"

1,raster,111,"I would get a different digestive enzyme product that isn’t fish derived and doesn’t contain iodine. You likely developed the rash because iodine has strong detoxing properties.

I recommend checking out the candia5 hypo-sensitization test for diagnosis. For acid problems I would look at taking acid products such as SF722, raw apple cider vinegar, vitamin C, coconut oil, hydro-chloric acid, etc. For back pain you could be having kidney or liver symptoms and/or mineral deficiencies, its hard to say. -raster"
0,rroy,112,"I haven’t started the diet yet and I’m already frustrated. I rather jumped the gun with probiotics as I just got off of antibiotics for a throat infection. Food allergy testing last year indicated that I’m highly sensitive to dairy, eggs, and yeast. I’m also slightly sensitive to buckwheat. It’s no surprise to me on the yeast given that I struggled with ear infections for years, also contraceptives, and I love sugar though I gave up that and alcohol a couple of months ago. What I’m wondering is what I can eat. Most of the recipes call for eggs or greek yogurt. Buckwheat being an issue too is annoying. I cannot make coconut flour pancakes that are edible, which annoys me as I’m very skilled at making pancakes normally. Breakfast is the main issue I suppose. One can only eat so much oat bran and things with coconut. I feel like I need a specialized diet plan for my specialized diet plan. I’m also a multi-sport athlete and a very busy person in general. I find the guide frustrating and almost wish I had physical copies rather than digital. Can anyone offer some suggestions? Anyone else unable to eat dairy and eggs?"
1,raster,112,Try out rutabega as a potato replacement… Try out cream of rice and steel cut oats as alternatives to cream of buckwheat.

2,BeccaJR,114,I’m not taking an anti-fungal at this time. I was advised against it because I was already getting so sick from the diet that it might be too much for me.
3,raster,114,"What is your diet like? Are you constipated? How is your sleep? I recommend considering acupuncture and/or trying other supplements. Can you tolerate liver cleansing herbs? I think you are simply adjusting from a high energy diet to a low energy diet. If you consumed foods with certain bad carbs or sugar, you likely would feel a bunch better energy-wise. Chamomile tea is something that I drink instead of coffee. It is antifungal and promotes digestion also. If you steep it longer than 7 minutes then it gives you energy vs. making you sleepy. Certain foods give you a lot of energy. Rutabega, pumpkin, coconut oil, flax, teff, etc. give you a ton of healthy energy. It could come down to you not developing a good enough diet, atleast right now. -raster"
4,BeccaJR,114,"My diet is really good in my opinion. I eat a maximum of 2 eggs per days (they are my main source of protein and they do not constipate me). I eat a variety of vegetables eggplant, rutabaga, celery, onions, zucchini etc. and those are the foundation of my diet. I bake with almond or coconut flour (I don’t eat buckwheat as I haven’t found a good enough source to be certified gluten-free since my Celiac’s is very sensitive). I eat at least a tablespoon of coconut oil per day through cooking or using it raw in smoothies. I also eat at least 2 tablespoons of chia, hemp and flaxseeds daily. I have tested these all and they do not irritate me. Prior to the ACD I was paleo and off of refined sugars for about 10 months. The only sugars I had previously consumed were from fruits, maple syrup or honey (from our own bee hives) and those were eaten minimally. I felt a lot better on the low-carb diet, probably due to grains irritating the Celiacs. At the moment I take a tincture made from Apple Cider Vinegar with fennel seed, orange peel, ginger and dandelion. I also drink a glass of warm water with lemon and this tincture every morning before anything else. I also incorporate teas made from milk thistle, dandelion root and burdock root, but find I can only drink these minimally. If I come on too strong on my liver I get far worse, I think my body is very poisoned. Whenever I used to eat chia seeds I would get sick because I was so toxic, but after doing some enemas I was able to eat them. I am not constipated and have about 4 bm’s per day thanks to taking magnesium citrate. Also I sleep like a rock. Wake up in the morning not feeling rested at all though. If I could I would sleep all day."
5,lolcandida,114,"If eggs are your main protein source you should be eating at least 6 per day, more like 10. Elaborate more on your diet it is very possible you are just malnourished. Your symptoms do not sound like die off which you should not really be happening much from a good diet change you should notice a decrease in symptoms not an increase. Die off mainly occurs immediately after or shortly following intake of an anti fungal and should not last multiple days."
6,NorwayDude,114,"Hi Becca! Candidiasis is a very difficult topic. And I’ve been struggling with this for 5-6 years by now. And sometimes its been real intense. They say Candidiasis ( candida ) does not produce so much symptoms in males as in females, because of basic physiology. But I’ve had it all. I’ve taken loads of self evaluation tests both with : * the yeast connection, william crook http://www.yeastconnection.com/index.html * Ann Boroch’s ”candida cure”. This book is recommended!  * Dr Whiting’s self evaluation. candidaclinic.org. This page is also highly recommended. In my opinion, based in everything I’ve tried and experienced over the years, It’s a lot of misconception regarding this topic. First of all, many of the diets I see presented with people in this forum and other places are very difficult to follow. And they’re also very nutrient deficient. Secondly, candidiasis and candida starts in the gut – and It impairs gut absorption. So as you can see, it’s all downhill from here unless you start to fight back. And It’s not done overnight, but you’ll see results pretty quick If you are dilligent. Okay, anyways – based on what I’ve read throughout the years and experienced myself by trying out, this is what I’ve had best experience with. I’ll outline this in 8 simple points: 1. Avoid any type of quick sugars ( sugar, honey, molasses, syrup and so forth) . Don’t be so strict about rice, potatoes and these types of things. They still have some valuable nutrients in them. 2. Most people with candidiasis struggle with gluten, dairy or both. The best thing is to avoid both of them – but if thats difficult – avoid gluten 100% (wheat, barley, rye and oats) and avoid all types of milk. Cheese and butter is OK.  3. You Must supplement!! Even though malnutrition isn’t necessary the root cause ( most likely its overuse of steroids, birth control and antibiotics ) it will certainly make it worse. My recommendation is this: use a good multivitamin, extra vitamin C( 1-2 grams a day ), omega 3 (2 grams a day) and a colloidal liquid trace mineral complex ( i recommend TJ Clark, phonix nutritionals or Youngevity. ) AND, Always take your supplements with food. 4. In the case of candidiasis, malabsorption is a problem – because not only does candidiasis create low stomach acid in most people which impairs protein digestion – it also creates intestine problems which ecxarbates these problems further. Thats the reason why dairy and gluten often times is problematic for candida sufferers. I recommend taking a full spectrum digestive enzyme supplements, preferably something like Now Super enzymes, Doctors best Digestive enzymes, Houston Tri Enza or Twinlab Super Enzymes. Take 1-2 per meal , depending on severity of gastric problems. Try eating three full meals a day ( breakfast, lunch and dinner ) and avoid snacking in between.  5. Caffeine is a problem, because usually your adrenals are stressed out from the candidiasis. Avoid coffee, espresso and black tea. Green tea and white tea OK (caffeine contents much lower ). Do not drink after 3 in the afternoon, this will ruin or disturb your sleep. Herbal teas are also great. 6. The literature revolving candidiasis and hydrogen peroxide shows posistive results. Infact, Dr Whiting says candida is anaerobic in nature ( without oxygen ) so food grade hydrogen peroxide formulas will help. NB: Only use 35 % food grade hydrogen peroxide. I recommend Dr Whitings product ”Oxy aloe”. This will take out all candidiasis. You might need 2 flushes. One flush costs about 400-500 dollars. Read this at candidaclinic.org. He’s done loads of research on this. It will definitely be worth the money. 7. You must make sure you get enough Calcium and magnesium everyday , or else your sleep and insomnia will be worse. These minerals are very important. I recommend Youngevity’s OsteoFX powder. This is the best there is. Take with meals. 8. Relax and don’t stress. The results will come pretty fast with this program. It sounds extensive, but it is not really very difficult. A typical day will look like this: 1. Take 2 ounces Oxyaloe half an hour before breakfast – eat ex. 2-3 eggs with cooked vegetables,brown rice or potatoes. Gluten free oatmeal is also ok. Take the supplements with the meal ( multi, C, Omega 3 and liquid calcium) 2. Lunch : take 2 ounces oxyaloe half an hour before lunch. eat glutenfree, lactose and sugarfree. 3. Dinner: take 2 ounces oxyaloe half an hour before dinner. Glutenfree, lactose and sugarfree meal.(take C, omega 3 and liquid calcium with this). 4. Drink 1-2 cups of water/ herbal tea in between every meal. Get well soon!!"
7,BeccaJR,114,"Thank you NorwayDude and lolcandida for your responses. As far as the protein goes I also make baked goods with coconut flours, use a lot of high protein seeds like flax, chia and hemp and every other day I eat meats like chicken and every now and then beef (all meats are from our neighbour’s or from our own farm, hormone and antibiotic free). Eggs are a consistent protein in my diet, farm fresh from my own chickens. I don’t know what to say my typical diet is like, but it involves eggs in the morning with eggplant or coconut flour crackers, chicken or mixed veggies at lunch, and more vegetables at dinner. I mix in protein smoothies with coconut milk and mixed seeds or coconut yogurt with mixed seeds. I have tested all of these foods and none of them irritate me or exacerbate my symptoms. I am following those guidelines without some of the supplements since I have adverse reactions to most, however with my stomach being super sensitive from Celiac I haven’t eaten grains in over a year (been on the ACD for over 2 months now). I tried introducing in oatmeal but my belly got so bloated, it swelled up to the size of a pregnant belly. Thank you for the tips, I’ll see what else I might be able to introduce. I am already using regularly: aloe, magnesium citrate, liquid multi, raw adrenal, B-Complex, chlorella, electrolyte hydrator with added vitamin C, bitters tincture for my liver and colon support. I also integrate a lot of coconut oil, apple cider vinegar and cinnamon into my diet along with herbs like peppermint, oregano, cayenne, cloves etc. I’ve recently consulted a naturopathic doctor in my area and am waiting for test results for Lyme which was sent down to the States.(I am in Canada and I would have better results in getting efficient testing if I were a dog). I am having severe neurological symptoms which seem to be more than what just Candida would cause. Candida and Lyme do to go hand in hand, and I know I do have Candida, just need to make sure I have an appropriate diagnosis."
8,raster,114,One thing I would consider removing is the chlorella which is a chelator supplement…this can cause all sorts of problems too. I also would look into mercury toxicity and consider that someday too. You likely can’t handle it right now I am guessing. -raster
9,linulPA,114,"Hi, Becca, hope you feeling better, if you feeling worse on bentonine, it is strong chelating agent and pulls out not just candida toxins, but all other toxins including heavy metals and can make people very sick.. ask your dr to stop it, ask if you can use use very low dose capryl or Nystatin pills and increase dose gradually"
10,BeccaJR,114,"I removed chlorella from my regime and there was no change even after 1 1/2 weeks. I just found out I have Lyme disease, so I am following through with the Cowden protocol with the help of a naturopath since there are no Lyme-literate medical doctors in my province with only 3 Lyme literate doctors (mostly naturopaths) in all of Canada as recognized by the International Lyme Association. Ridiculous. Thank you for all of your help."
0,moldhater23,115,"So I just got off of a week of grapefruit seed extract, not my favorite taste, but manageable. I am now moving to a week of Oregano Oil and wow. I put six drops in a pint glass.

10,jameskep,115,"I’m curious if anyone has felt better by doing oregano oil(long-term)? It just seems to be such a spicy and irritating oil that it would cause a lot of inflammation in the long run. I am too cautious of the essential oils taken internally that can cause burning or extreme irritation. Seems like these oils can cause a lot of GI inflammation as well. I would rather experiment with essential oils that are more mild on the gut. I found Lavender oil to be just as effective as oregano oil without all the GI irritation. Just a experiment though as the long term toxicity and effects on good bacteria has not been well researched yet. Also experimenting with myrrh oil and spearmint oil to see how they compare with oregano oil. Myrrh oil has eugenol and spearmint oil has farnesol which are both anti-fungal. **I noticed the essential oils to be more effective when they are mixed with olive oil/ high monounsaturated veggie oil. It seems to help sustain the activity better. Enteric-coated capsules are also available. Again, this is just an experimentation and can’t recommend them long term due to the unknown long term toxicity or possible side effects that it might have on good bacteria. Lavender oil: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16178366"
11,kingbean,115,I took oregano for 2 for 2 days and just felt dreadful. Can I really be that sensitive!?!
12,jameskep,115,Its definitely possible especially if you have a sensitive gut or an already inflamed gut.
13,linulPA,115,"try oil of oregano capsules, worked very good for me, 1 3 times a day, but oil of oregano should not be used long term just like any other antibiotics or antifungals, it should be rotated after 4-6 weeks"
0,Wolfman,116,"Hi 6 months ago via Dr Hauss’s stool test, I was told I “have a high intestinal colonisation of candida albicans.” Symptons were small white sores around my anus (given cream), an unpleasant urgency to go to the toilet after eating but not quite diorhhea, and a frequent urinary tract burning sensation I guess is cystitis-like. I had no other obvious symptons, no white coat on tongue for example. The above test revealed :- Candida Albicans 10.5-10.6 HIGH (normal is 10.2) Candida spec – 10.2 (normal) Pathogen secretory aspartic protease – POSITIVE ( this being a a marker enzyme to assess if yeast is harmless) Geothictium spec – 10.2 (normal) Moulds – negative Yeast in mouth swab – 10.5-10.6 HIGH (normal is 10.2) Stool PH – 6.0 SLIGHTLY DECREASED (normal is 6.2 – 6.8) Over past 5 months I have been on a strict diet, taken many pro-biotics such as acidophilus, oregano, garlic, low sugar yogurt with active lactobifidus and acidophilus, and also been on Nystatin capsules. I do feel a lot better, not entirely sympton-free but much better, so I took a blood test via Cambridge Nutritional Services last week,and received these results:- Candida IgG 0.3U/ml (normal range is 0-30) Candida IgM 2.0U/ml (normal range is 0-10) So all looks very good, but I also read somewhere that intestinal candida might not show up on blood tests unless the bacteria has entered the blood stream. How accurate are blood tests for detecting Candida Albicans of the intestines?"
1,raster,116,Dvjorge recommends the delayed sensitivity test that you can do at home…candia5 is the website. This test looks at other characteristics he has wrote about recently in this test. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6671_Candia5-test-kit.aspx -raster

0,AngelaL,117,"Just a small question – has anyone actually done the 7 day vegetable cleanse (with eggs also allowed) at the start of the LR diet – and lived to tell the tale? I need to start the diet soon – but I’m a little put off by this part, however I feel that I need to at least try it or I will feel that I’ve wasted my money."
1,joe,117,"yes it works really good, I won’t lie…it’s not easy but if you have Candida it’s necessary, after the first couple days you start to adjust. You wont be in your comfort zone but then again if your considering the diet you are already uncomfortable with what’s going on in your gut. Just remember and tell yourself your on the road to getting better and you will start to feel a lot better in a few days.But make sure you take a NAC supplement and molybdenum and selenium. because the die off will make you feel like your not getting anywhere. Try not to make the detox drink to strong like I did and have your heart beating out of control. I’m 40 days in and and lost 10 pounds of belly fat in 2 weeks and my stomach is so flat just like it should be.I haven’t had gas or bloating issues as long as I stay close to the diet. I cheat here and there but I can tell the diet really works if you stay on it. Lisa’s advice is solid and cuts right to the chase.  Good Luck"
2,TheChosenOne,117,Don’t forget to add some oil in your cleanse. Flax oil and hemp oil are excellent oils. Do not forget to support your liver.

I’ve ordered the NAC supplement on the internet and it should arrive soon. I plan to take the day off on Friday and start the cleanse then, giving me four full days over the bank holiday weekend, so hopefully it will have arrived by then. I already take flaxseed oil as a supplement and will continue to do so throughout the cleanse and I plan also to include hemp seeds for the protein value. Do I need to take hemp oil as well? Also I take chia seeds and pumpkin seeds as part of my morning shake – do you know if these are allowed on the first part of the cleanse? I could not find anywhere that they were specifically forbidden …"

7,AngelaL,117,"Well I’m on the second day of my vegetable cleanse and feeling pretty lousy. I’m not feeling hungry or missing caffeine or sugar the problem is that I feel awful as if I’m getting the flu – I have swollen glands, earache and a sore throat. This happened to me before on a detox (where I was actually eating meat) and I think it’s because of the lack of carbohydrate. LR says in her book that cutting out carbohydrate can seriously weaken the immune system and I’m worried that this is what is happening. Has this happened to anyone and else and have they any ideas what I can do to prevent it? What non-starchy veg are high in carbohydrates? I’m sorry to say that I weakened and eat two packets of cheese and onion crisps but I have decided to ignore that an carry on – it could have been worse! It seems a shame to give up now as I have really psyched myself up to go the full seven days."
8,MadEmx,117,"Hi, I am starting the cleanse on Sunday. In preparation mode. COuld you be feeling lousy because of die-off?

0,Vegan Catlady,118,"I wanted to start a thread for the people who have had experiences with testing. Did you find the test a scam,or helpful? Was the test conclusive,or a waste of time? What would you tell people spending money on different tests?"
1,Vegan Catlady,118,"My experience here is that I went to the hospital very dizzy (couldnt drive) and told the ER doc I thought I might be battling a fungal infection. He looked in my throat and said “dont see any candida there!”. They took tests and when I asked if they tested for candida ( I didnt know anything about candida at the time, I only just learned of it)all he said was “I didnt see anything that would tell me you have any of that” Asked my regular MD if she could test for it. She told me “there are no conclusive tests that she knows of”. Waited a month to see this guy that did blood analysis at a natural food store. He didnt show up for the days he was supposed to be there, and showed up on days he wasnt. Im glad now I didnt have it done. It costs 50$ I know now that with enough research, you can narrow-down how likely that what you have is candida overgrowth. He couldnt have told me anything I didnt figure out on my own."
2,Vegan Catlady,118,"http://www.thecandidadiet.com/testingforcandida.htm Blood Test An Anti-Candida Antibodies, or Candida Immune Complexes test. There are 3 antibodies that should be tested to measure your immune system’s response to Candida – IgG, IgA, and IgM. High levels of these antibodies indicate that an overgrowth of Candida is present. This is the most reliable test for Candidiasis that you can find. Stool Analysis Your stool is directly analyzed for levels of yeast, pathogenic bacteria and friendly bacteria. However Candida often does not show up in this test, so the blood test is more reliable. Urine Tartaric Acid Test This test detects tartaric acid – a waste product of Candida yeast overgrowth. An elevated test means an overgrowth of Candida. Again, this test can be unreliable so the blood test is more likely to give an accurate result."
3,ThomasJoel2,118,A stool analysis from a reputable lab like Metametrix is probably your best bet.
4,MadEmx,118,"Interesting. I have had the stool and blood test. The stool showed heavy to moderate bacterial growh and the blood test only measured IgG by the looks of it.

0,420biker,121,"Ive been suffering with candida for 2 years now. Ive been treating the candida with the directions of the website for almost 6 months now, it helped quite a bit but never got rid of all of the candida, and anytime i would eat anything with the smallest amount of sugar i would get way worse. It seemed like i got to a point that there was no longer any die off so i needed to do something a little more extreme to starve off the fungus. antifungals werent giving me die off. I was still waking up every morning having to scrape the hell out of my tongue to get the white thrush off. I heard that fasting is very good for detoxing the body so i gave it a try. I had the soup broth while fasting, drank lots of water, and i took multivitamins, and supplements for my adrenal exaustion. Within 3-4 days there was no trace of candida at all, not even when i woke up the next morning. While fasting I also ingested and smoked about $400 worth of purified high grade hash oil i made myself, not sure if that is what helped cure me. When prepared this way, hash oil can cure any cancer in 3 months, even terminal cancers, so i think it might play a role in stopping fungus from spreading as well. Check out Rick Simpson’s run from the Cure: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0psJhQHk_GI The only reason marijuana is illegal is because it cures cancer way better than chemo, and they cant put a patent on it because its a herb. Also, another reason is because the FDA is run by the people who own the banks and pharmacuetical industry, and THC is a better alternative to over half of the pharma drugs. There is a lot of deception behind the miracle plant. I dont recommend this at all, but since i was cured I ate chicken slow cooked in tomatoes to celebrate, then ended up eating a bunch of chocolate chips and granola bars with sugar… still no candida the next day which is a miracle to me! I am now on another fast, this should get rid of the rest of the fungus toxins in my body, but if not i will just do it again. I lived in a house with black mold before my candida got really bad, and shortly after that i was diagnosed with food allergies … allergic to eggs, wheat, gluten, dairy, whenever i eat any of them my stomach swells up inside and usually bleeds. I am told the way the fast works is by cleaning toxins from your bloodstream, and every day you do a water fast it is equivilant to approximately one year of building up toxins in your blood. After doing the fast i felt much more relaxed and slept better than usual. I usually have dark circles under my eyes, those are now pretty much gone. I have much more mental clarity which is good because i have adhd from head injuries. I no longer get anxiety for no reason. I was diagnosed with adrenal exaustion by my naturopathic doctor and have been treating it with vitamins and licorice root for about the same amount of time i have been doing the candida cleanse… about 6 months. The fast has made quite a bit of progress on healing my adrenal glands as well. I take b complex, adrenal support, omega3 and 6, multivitamins and multiminerals, and melatonin that i get from my naturopathic doctor… they cost about $300 a month so hopefully i can stop taking them soon. I took all of them during the fast. 6 months ago when i did the test, i had stage 3 adrenal exaustion, which is the worst stage, and i am only 25. But i have had a series of stressful events and post traumatic stress disorder which caused my sleep cycle to be disrupted, plus the candida was probably attacking my adrenals as well. I suggest you guys check yourselves out on a self test for adrenal exaustion, i have heard that candida and adrenal fatique often go hand and hand. Symptoms are that you have a much harder time dealing with stress, and you never really feel awake in the morning, but at night time you are wide awake."
1,raster,121,Did you juice or eat anything else while fasting? How long has it been since your fast and what are you eating now regularly? This is very interesting except the hash part…I do not think this has anti-candida properties whatsoever and should make it worse lol. -raster
2,raster,121,"Also, on a side note, did you know that melatonin has side effects? It shouldn’t be taken long term because it can cause breast problems in women and it becomes ineffective in time. I take PS-100 aka Phosphatidylserine as an alternative and I recommend that you ask your naturopath about it because it has no side effects. It also boosts brain activity and makes you feel good in general. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphatidylserine -raster"
3,420biker,121,"Its been 2 days since the fast. Ate slow cooked chicken 2 days in a row but had a bunch of choclate on the 2nd day. Pretty much just did a water fast, except had the soup broth from this website 3x a day. Im starting a new fast starting this morning. Yeah melotonin probably isnt the best to take long term but i hardly need it now anyway… just gotta stick to my routine and not stay up late."
4,420biker,121,"Also all water i drink, i alkaline it before i drink it… you can buy these alkaline sticks that make your water the opposite of acidic, it helps keep you from getting too hungry and it helps keep fungus from spreading. Its $15 for the stick and its good for about 3 months, i got it at the naturopathic doc but anyone can buy them"
5,Latka,121,"I have also previously experienced that my symptoms disappeared while fasting. However, at least for me they also returned when I started eating food again (and I was following the strict diet). It seems to me that fasting can give the digestive system a break and allow it to heal. It is however not something I want to or can keep doing in the long term, and I am not sure if it’s a long term solution for curing candida. If it worked for you, that’ s great. I will keep looking fora solution that might work for me."
6,Able900,121,"“(Alkaline) helps keep fungus from spreading.” That statement is quite incorrect. The statement below is quoted from The mBio Access Publication in association with the American Academy of Microbiology. “The fungal pathogen Candida albicans induces hyphal morphogenesis by raising extracellular pH.”  (The higher the pH, the more alkaline the environment becomes.) The pH balance of most of your body normally takes care of itself unless you do something drastic (such as drinking alkaline water) in an attempt to change it. However, in order to cure a Candida infestation, you’ll have to do what is necessary to allow your intestines to develop an acidic pH environment. The reason this is necessary is because an alkaline environment in your intestines will turn the Candida growth gene on and therefore convert the benign Candida in your body into an aggressive, pathogenic fungal form that we know as Candida albicans. This is why you have your infestation, and until you reverse the situation by rebuilding the flora, you’ll have to continue to deal with the infestation. As stated, in order to change the environment of your intestines from alkaline to acidic, rebuilding the population of the flora in your intestines is required; there’s simply no other way to come to a complete cure without this taking place. Consider that that the bacteria are referred to as “lactic acid bacteria” in reference to their acidic nature. This is one of the reasons that homemade kefir and high doses of quality probiotics are recommended in our protocol as they both contain lactic acid bacteria. Able"

But I was under the impression that not eating when you had adrenal fatigue was one of the worst things you could do. I think what you said about adrenal problems is true. I haven’t read much into it, but it seems like staying out of ketosis as much as possible allows your adrenals to rest somewhat. Even most carb-bingers enter ketosis overnight, so people with adrenal issues might want something with some carbs before bed to help support them overnight. It’s probably even more necessary for those with poor liver function, since they probably won’t be able to store much glycogen. As for IF, I’m still not decided on it. It seems to allow the body to do some metabolic “cleanup” on the one hand, improving insulin resistance, increasing autophagy etc, but it’s harder on the adrenals and thyroid on the other. If it makes you feel good and no other symptoms appear, it’s probably a sign that you’re okay with it. Might be a good idea to read up on it first though. The blogosphere seems quite polarised on it, as with most things…"
9,420biker,121,"Yeah i think a veggie fast is the way to go for adrenal exaustion (juice the veggies.. lots of broccoli), but just for a period of time to give the digestive system a break. The water fast seemed to help my adrenals at first but then they got a little worse after… but it could from the choclate i ate. But fasting is definately helpful in adrenal exaustion if you do it right, anyway that you can eliminate toxins without messing them up worse. I totally messed my fast up though.. you gotta do it either before, during, or after the 14 day veggie cleanse they talk about on the site.. otherwise it doesnt do much good in starving bad bacteria. The biggest benefit of the the fast is that you learn what your actual hunger level is, not your comfort zone hunger level… but your actual hunger level. I found it was much easier to eat smaller meals less frequenly now after i did the fast. I just checked out a youtube video on some guy who cured his candida, and other people’s candida by eating fruit instead of meals… the way it works is by powering up your liver with vitamin c so it can overcome the candida. It makes logical sense because sometimes when i get the munchies and i eat some fruit my candida gets better for a while… the trick is you gotta eat it on an empty stomach, and he says not to eat very much food either. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Whe9_6Qo6zo This fruit diet could be our missing link to getting rid of this for good. Attack the problem by the root cause…. your liver… which needs all kinds of sources of yummy vitamin C… not just starving it with boring vegetables lol.. yes i know veggies have vitamin c but i think we probably need all kinds of sources of it. It might be part of why we crave sweets so badly.. maybe becuz we need more fruit in our system?? the guy in the vid says the fruit will bind to the toxins and remove them from your body. im pretty sure you have fruit instead of supper for about 3x a week. Im gonna try this out, we shall see how she goes. If it doesnt work out i can always go back to square 1 and try another 14 day cleanse, but this time do it while im doing a parasite cleanse at the same time.. that would kick some serious albicanis ass. Ill keep u posted"
10,Javizy,121," The biggest benefit of the the fast is that you learn what your actual hunger level is, not your comfort zone hunger level… but your actual hunger level. I found it was much easier to eat smaller meals less frequenly now after i did the fast. This probably has more to do with hormonal changes/destruction during such a long “cleanse”, e.g. increased reverse T3. Your body slows your metabolism down, so you expend less energy and have less appetite, and probably cold feet, hair loss, fatigue etc if it persists. It’s a natural survival mechanism during starvation or massive calorie deficit. There are easier ways to get vitamin C than extreme diets, and it doesn’t explain the potential benefits of a fruitarian approach. High sugar, high mineral diets seem to work for some people, but it depends on what problem you’re trying to solve. If your candida is a symptom of weak thyroid or adrenal function (do lots of fasting if you like this), fatty liver, poor glucose handling etc, then a diet that focuses on those issues may help it. I don’t understand the crappy music link though? Spam maybe?"
11,bullandbear,121,"The results of your fasting routine seems appealing. However, it scares me greatly that I have to fast. I have lost more 6 pounds from March to mid June and then when I started a herbal cleanse in June, I’ve accelerated my weight-loss and from June to now, I’ve dropped another 10 pounds. My diet is not exactly an anti candida diet. I still take some vinegar and supposedly restricted carbs (including fruits, root vegetables, mushrooms etc) along with protein and greens. I figure that I cannot afford to lose more weight with a strict adherence to the candida diet. If anything, I’m eating more and my grocery bills have gone off the roof. I’m just not absorbing my food i think. My condition has reached a point where the weight loss actually freaks me out and stresses me so much just thinking it may be cancer instead because I couldn’t get a proper diagnosis on Candida. My spouse thinks I’m delusional now and I have no support to lean on. I train with weights and resistance and have never thought of wanting to lose weight, if anything, I wish I had another 20-40lbs on my now only 162lb frame. Did you notice severe or rapid weight loss on the fast? That’s something I want to avoid. On the topic, does anyone here also experience rapid weight loss when on a cleanse? I don’t know if weight loss is a symptom of die-off or not. I take a rotation of coconut oil and garlic, Dr Christopher’s Parasite cleanse and Clove oil. I also take a probiotic supplement at least few hours from my anti-fungals."
12,Able900,121,"I figure that I cannot afford to lose more weight with a strict adherence to the candida diet. Are you using virgin coconut oil and eating avocados in your diet? These alone stopped my weight loss from occurring, and as you add more of the coconut oil, the weight slowly starts to return. If you’ve not used it, start with one teaspoon of coconut oil and work your way up to 14-16 teaspoons a day. Able"
13,420biker,121,"Ive had a problem with losing weight too… i havent weighed this little ever since i was 16 and im 25 now.. but when i did the fast i only lost half a pound a day, some days i didnt lose any at all. After i ate something i ended up weighing more than i did before starting the fast. Last night i had a really dry mouth and my candida was starting to spread a bit from all the chocolate ive been eating… i tried eating a bunch of fruit on a somewhat empty stomach… almost right away i could feel the acids of the fruit breaking down toxins in me. The next morning, woke up with a very clear mouth, mouth was not dry at all either. I ate 6 cherries, 1 apple (including eating the seeds.. they cure cancer so they might help candida) and about 10 strawberries, then i ate a piece of raw celery after the fruit. I didnt even take the liver flush, or the fibre yesterday and im not constipated either for once.. one of the biggest bowel movements i have had in a long time. I think fasting would work awesome with fruit.. nothing but oxygen, lotsa and good vitamin c for the liver… plus the liver gets a break since it doesnt need to break down food so much. EAT MORE FRUIT, thank me later 😛"
14,420biker,121,"Holy i lost 9.5lbs over night after i ate that fruit.. its got to be all toxic waste my body got rid of because there was alot of it. I did not lose any muscle tone at all. Dark circles are hardly there at all even though i didnt sleep too well last night, since i didnt smoke up early enough in the night to burn out in time. This morning for breakfast i had some more strawberries, an apple and a bunch of blueberries… mouth is continuing to be very clear. I waited until i was sure i was hungry, then for lunch i ate some sea salt rice chips (sugar free healthy ones), a handful of almonds, and a piece of raw celery. Im noticing that im getting some decent die off from the fruit cleansing ive been doing. I havent even been having any kind of antifungals the last 2 days… who woulda thought fruit by itself would work so well… you would think the sugar in the fruit would feed the candida, but it overpowers this effect by fixing the root cause. The trick is to make sure you eat it on an empty stomach, fruit digests much quicker than any other food you eat, and it needs to be able to go through fast or it will only ferment. The acids break down toxic waste and shoots it out of your body. Make sure you eat the fruit in small bites, since saliva is needed to break down the food, and chew well. Whatever you do, dont cut the fruit… eat it whole. Cutting it instantly destroys most of the vitamin C. The problem with starving off the candida with just veggies is that it cant break down the toxins properly. So in the end no matter how long you cleanse there is still toxins left over. You need to break them down with fruit acid and keep doing so, im going to see if i can finish beating this without antifungals or probiotics, it probably will save me alot of money."
0,KDdid,122,"Hello All, I’ll start by saying that I’m kinda at my wits end. I have a skin condition on both of my feet (soles and outer sides) that I was told by an online podiatrist is called dyshrodosis, which is caused by a yeast infection in the gut and which I’ve had for going on 15 years now and for once, I think this podiatrist is right, because upon looking at the photos for dyshidrosis, it looks exactly like what I have on my feet. The symptoms seemed to have started when I had braces put on my teeth very late in life (14 years ago). The online podiatrist seems to think that the braces were the root of the problem and that is what started the whole thing. I might also add, that I didn’t have this before having the braces put on. The only prescriptions that my doctors at my HMO give me for the condition are steroids, because they are all hung up in believing that I have contact dermatitis. However, I was told (by the online podiatrist) that steroids only worsens the condition. I tend to believe her, because any time I apply the steroid creams or ointments to my foot, the condition worsens. The podiatrist suggested to me that to get rid of the yeast in my gut, I should be taking non-sacarose Oral Nystatin Suspension for three weeks. This medication is not OTC like it is in the rest of the world, and I know that if I suggested to my dermatologist, he’s going to shoot it down, simply because it was not suggested by him. My question is: Is there an online pharmacy where I can by Oral Nystatin Suspension? Or is there anything strong that is natural that I can take for the dyshidrosis on my feet? Any insight or input will be deeply appreciated! Thank you. -Kd"

1,Floggi,123,"  Nothing on your list looks unhealthy. Assuming, of course, that you don’t take enormous quantities of this stuff. So in that sense, your list looks safe to me. The only possible problem I see is that your body (and/or your gut bacteria) will have to adapt to your new food pattern. This adaptation takes some time, and you may experience some (mostly mild) symptoms as a consequence. If you feel nervous, or if you just want to be safe, you could make the switch more gradually. Let’s say you add the components one by one, or you gradually increase the quantities. That will make the switch easier for your body / your gut bacteria. After all, you’ve been in this situation for at least six months, so I guess it doesn’t really matter all that much whether you start the detox today or next week – which means that you can slowly move to your new diet in the course of a week, perhaps even in the course of the next two weeks. But then, these are just my thoughts. I immediately admit that I’m no expert in this field, even though I made some very gradual changes to my own food consumption (sometimes even during several months instead of all at once). So I may be wrong, or sub-optimal. Therefore, if any of the experts on this forum has a different opinion, just forget what I wrote here, and follow the experts. And follow your own feelings of course, because no expert knows your body as well as you do.  "

0,KennyG,126,"Hello all. I wrote the post “This is a MUST read for everyone with CANDIDA.” which explains that mercury is the number one cause of candida. If you search “Candida and Mercury” on google you will get around 1,850,000 results. Candida is from mercury leaking out of dental silver fillings and vaccines. If your mother had amalgam fillings then a great deal of mercury was passed into you while you were born. I have been doing lots of research because many people have no fillings and don’t belive in vaccines, yet they still suffer with candida. I was wondering where does all this extra mercury come from? Why are we all sick??? The answer is chemtrails. What Do Chemtrails Contain? Several independent tests in the United States have shown that chemtrails have contained the following substances: Aluminum Magnesium Barium and barium salts Lead Arsenic Uranium Sharp titanium shards Mercury Mold spores Mycoplasma Unidentified bacteria These substances being sprayed by in large plumes by silver or white military jets are harmful to human and animal life. Some of the aspects of this toxicity are covered in a section below. Mercury mercury is the most toxic non-radioactive metal known. mercury accumulates in the body and causes a myriad of toxic effects, eventually leading to chronic, degenerative disease, and eventually death. Diseases and conditions associated with mercury are: Allergies Asthma Autism (contrary to popular belief, there is very strong medical evidence linking autism to mercury) Nearsightedness & Farsightedness (by altering interocular fluid eye pressure) Autoimmune Diseases (through methionine mimicry and other processes) Amylotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Ankylosing spondylitis Myasthenia Gravis Parkinson’s Disease Alzheimer’s Disease Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorders Borderline personality disorder Anxiety Panic attacks Dysbiosis Leaky Gut Syndrome Acid Reflux Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Learning Disabilities Endocrine-Related Issues Aneurysm Depression Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCS) Manic Depressive Disorder Hyperacusis (sensitivity to certain sounds) Photophobia (sensitivity to light from weak iris response) Heart Arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat) Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) Rheumatoid Arthritis Juvenile Arthritis Lupus Erythematosus Multiple Chemical Sensitivities Environmental Illness Chronic Fatigue Fibromyalgia Sciatica Gastritis Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Colitis Crohn’s Disease Sleep Disorders Anorexia Nervosa Floaters In the Eyes Bulimia Hypothyroidism Yeast Syndrome/Candida Uncontrollable Weight Gain Hair loss (Balding—Elevated DHT) Constipation Flatulence (gas) Shifted Circadian Rhythm (inability to sleep on a normal schedule) Hypoglycemia Hyperglycemia Multiple Sclerosis Immune Suppression (weak immune system leading to frequent general illness or numerous opportunistic infections) Tinnitus (Ringing In the Ears) Grinding Teeth While Sleeping (Bruxism) Insomnia Excessive Salivating Enlarged Prostate (Elevated DHT) Heart Disease High Cholesterol Elevated Homocysteine (increases risk of heart disease) Headaches Mole Formation (especially on the neck, underarms, inner thighs, and feet) Dementia Blood in the Urine Nausea and Vomiting “Brain Fog” Dizziness (loss of equilibrium) Short-Term Memory Loss Cancer White Coating On the Tongue Oily Skin (Elevated DHT) Shyness General Phobias Outbursts of Anger Feelings of Apathy (especially toward property and personal affairs) Suicidal Thoughts Social Separation/Isolation Feeling of a Lack of Self Worth Spider Veins Easy Bruising (and other vitamin C deficiency diseases as mercury displaces vitamin C) Selenium Deficiency Zinc Deficiency Vitamin C Deficiency Iodine Deficiency Magnesium Deficiency Elevated Blood Calcium …and many more. Mold The fact that chemtrails contains mold spores is extremely concerning as mold produces mycotoxins that are very harmful to human and animal life. Mycotoxins have been studied for their application in biological weapons and is the cause of disease and even death in mold infested homes. Barium Barium is toxic to humans and animals and causes a dramatic drop in Potassium levels in the body. For this reason (and others), barium is known to considerably increase the frequency of heart attacks in persons 65 years and older. Aluminum Aluminum is toxic to human and animal life. Of particular concern is the fact that most people in industrialized countries have considerable exposure to mercury through amalgam fillings, coal-burning power plants, tattoos, and seafood. What is concerning about aluminum exposure is when mercury and aluminum combine in the body, the combined toxicity is about 100-times then with either substance alone. Sharp Titanium Shards Under a microscope, chemtrails are seen as extremely sharp, fibrous shards that embed themselves into lung tissue and break down the bacterial/viral-resistant properties of the lining that separate the air from the blood. This is concerning to those who anticipate a flu pandemic because this attribute of chemtrails will likely dramatically increase the communicability of the virus. Health Affects Chemtrails are now commonly associated with certain illnesses. A number of credible reports has demonstrated that respiratory-related illnesses increase dramatically in the presence of chemtrails. Symptoms that have been commonly associated with exposure to chemtrails include: Sinus pain Headaches Candida yeast Fatigue Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) Muscle aches/pain Joint pain Salty or “salty metallic” taste in the air or on the lips Itchy skin Nausea Eye floaters Dark circles under the eyes Brain fog Irritability other miscellaneous symptoms Certain types of chemtrails have been associated with flu-like symptoms particularly chemtrails that leave visible fibrous deposits on cars and on other hard surfaces. Why are you waiting? Get tested now!!! Here is the best urine test I found. 129$ http://dmsachelation.com/urine-test-for-heavy-metals/ The Urine Test shows the presence of 20 deadly toxic metals that might be in your body. Aluminum Cesium Tellurium  Antimony Gadolinium Thallium  Arsenic Lead Thorium  Barium Mercury Tin  Beryllium Nickel Uranium  Bismuth Palladium Tungsten  Cadmium Platinum If you have candida get checked for toxic heavy metals. So there ya go… we can not escape the poison in the sky but we can remove the poison from our teeth/bodies and detox regularly to stay healthy."

As reported by the Swedish paper Katrineholms Kuriren, Hagberg, the first major political leader to come forward on the issue, has openly admitted that these unusual cloud trails, which fail to dissipate like normal contrails do, are actually a toxic mix of chemicals, viruses, and metals that she has collectively referred to as “chemtrails.” According to Hagberg, the sprayings are a joint endeavor by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), as well as the Swedish government in her own country, to modify atmospheric conditions via deliberate aerosol spraying efforts. And included in this “dangerous” mix of aerosols are various chemical components, viruses and viral fragments, and metals such as aluminum and barium, which have already been shown to be accumulating in water supplies and soils around the world.

9,Floggi,126,"  Nice try. You pretend that “officials” have “admitted” something. In reality, a politician has made a statement. For your information, in a multi-party system (more than just the two that you can choose between in the USA), there are always some extremist parties, and some parties that have quite off-worldly views. To name just a few:In Ukraine, Darth Vader is running for president. See the video below.In the Netherlands, there is a “Party for the Animals”.In Sweden, there is a Pirate Party. So please, before mentioning an “official” and hiding the fact that he is in reality a politician, provide some background on him, his beliefs, and his party.    Also note that the site you’re quoting still believes that global warming is a myth and that the polar caps are not melting. That shows enough about their “reliability”. By the way, since you’re so into conspiracy theories, what’s your opinion on HAARP? You must “know” that HAARP is influencing us through electromagnetic waves, and they are modifying the planet’s atmosphere too.  "

For beneficial bacteria, I have NO GROWTH of lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and bactericides fraggillis group. I have 3+ e.coli (good kind) and 4+ clostridium and finally 2+ enteroccous group.  My GI doctor gave me an antibiotic that is NOT FUNCTIONING at antibiotic level, the purpose of it is to empty my stomach faster (my stomach is slownatndigesting after a gastric emptying scan) and LACTULOSE- to keep my bowels moving (hasn’t worked and I have been doing coffee enemas 1 a day) I’m also having vitamin C, magnesium, nystatin and diflucan and probiotics. With this information, I’ve heard lactolose is safe with candida, but is it safe with the bad bacteria in my gut? Also, the antiobiotic, even though it’s functioning at a low grade… Is it still only hurting me? And final question–I feel amazing. Best I’ve felt in awhile. Does that mean the bad bacteria are getting fed? Or would I be feeling worse if the bad bacteria were getting fed."

0,mash2100,128,"I’ve been struggling with candida for over a year and a half now and I’ve tried everything from a change in diet to probiotics to antifungals and still nothing. I’m not sure if this is a dumb question since I know many, if not most, cases of candida infection are caused by the use of antibiotics. However, let’s say if I continue eating healthy and using antifungals (like monistat 7) but I decide to take some antibiotics for a couple of days while also taking probiotics, could this get rid of candida? My logic behind this is that antibiotics basically sterilize your gut killing both the bad and the good bacteria. If I take probiotics, antifungals, and consume healthy food while cleaning out my gut with antibiotics, then the beneficial bacteria will grow back faster than the yeast. Just wondering if this is even possible?"
1,TheChosenOne,128,"No. As far as I know antibiotics have just a small effect on fungi. It will do more harm than good. In a normal person, it takes a few years before the probiotics have recolonized your bowels completely. In someone with candida this is even harder."

The general rule of taking supplements/antifungals is to stop them if you have problems with them. Constipation, rash and bloating are not a sign of die off. It’s either SF722 or the probiotics that cause the problem. Rash is generally an allergic reaction, whereas bloating is probably an enzyme/stomach acid problem (try to take some HCl supplements), you don’t chew your foods enough or it can be related to your constipation. Fruit/vegetable juices can soften constipation as wel as oat bran. Also drink a lot of water."
0,bstar,129,"Hi, I have been advised to take the Candida diet, and have the list of foods to avoid/eat, but am confused with the phase 1 period.

This includes: Breakfast – papaya Lunch – steamed veg/olive oil and quinoa Dinner – Miso soup broth (but now on steamed veggies/olive oil) Advised to have small amount of probiotic yogurt although yogurt gets me bloated (I have IBS) Adding nuts/seeds, then eggs, then fish, then chicken (don’t eat other meat) Would this diet be ok? I am travelling so there are no appropriate grains available, only rice which is not allowed. When at home is quinoa still ok as there seems to be some debate? And gluten-free oats?

0,dvjorge,130,"Hi all, I feel the necessity of expressing myself about a common behavior you see in ALL candida support forums. Since my health went down in 2008, I have been reading and writing in candida forums intensely. As many of you know, there is a limited amount of information in the medical community about this syndrome caused by candida albicans and other species. Normally, this syndrome begins after an excessive amount of antibiotic intake, sometimes combined with a suppressed immune system. Anyway, what I want to say is that there ARE many people who visits these forums who aren’t affected by this syndrome, but they believe so. Those people share their experiences here misguiding candida sufferers many times. I encourage those who doesn’t have enough experience and knowledge about this syndrome to stop advising what they believe is going to help when it wont. This syndrome is really complex and some people need to fight a real battle to recover. There are immunologic and iatrogenic causes linked to it. However, there are BASIC rules that applies to every single case of Candida Related Complex without exception. A low carbohydrate diet is a MUST to recover. Those who encourages increasing carbohydrates and eating FRUITS aren’t helping candida sufferers. Candida sufferers CAN NOT eat fruits when the infection is active. Those who eats fruits without restriction and get better aren’t affected by this syndrome. Same thing happens with a high carbohydrate diet. I won’t follow arguments about it. I am only doing it to help those NEW in this battle to do the things right. I am aware of websites and candida “invented” web naturopath Drs advising fruits. Yes, they exist as many more web protocols misguiding and making profit based on suffering. Part of my personal battle to recover has been reading every single Candida Related Complex book written by MDs ever published. Moreover, I can add my more than 4500 hours of reading candida patient forums and their experiences. So, please if you get better eating fruits and a high carbohydrate diet, it is great and I am more than happy about it. But, don’t encourage others to follow you because candida sufferers CAN NOT do it. A low carbohydrate diet is a must to recover. Dr. Crook mentioned in one of his books that you wont get better eating a high carbohydrate diet even if you take a truck loaded of Fluconazole. True.! There are many here thinking they have this syndrome when isn’t. Those are who gets better eating fruits, etc. Take home the message.! Jorge."

2,dvjorge,130,"Floggi;56726 wrote:   REMOVED BY MODERATOR   I will answer you only one time. This is a CANDIDA SUPPORT forum. Candida support forums are dedicated to people who suffers the syndrome called Candida Related Complex. This isn’t a general health forum, if not a dedicated forum to support those who needs to recover after developing this syndrome. This is about Candida Related Complex, about an intestinal/genital yeast overgrowth and the symptoms it produces. Do you understand it clear ?? I have told you the same thing in 3 different ways. People who comes here are expecting guidance, support, solidarity, care, and advice. An advice based on the knowledge and expertise of those who are battling or battled this syndrome. An advice based on the legacy left by those great pioneer MDs who discovered and studied this syndrome. They dedicated their life to treat candida related complex sufferers. They developed the diet and tested the treatments. Telling new people facing this syndrome they can eat a high carbohydrate diet or fruits openly is criminal in my opinion. It is irresponsible and unjust. People who are suffering this syndrome and follow an advice such as this will aggravate and prolongate their suffering. No matter if it is an open forum or not, we must be responsible about what we tell here. One more time, candida related complex sufferers CAN NOT eat a high carbohydrate diet and fruits openly. The infection will growth out control if they do it. Encouraging them to do it is totally irresponsible. You are a very contradictory person who isn’t contributing to the cause and mission of this forum, imo. Since I began reading your posts, they have been oriented to the controversy and argument. I haven’t read anything coming from you that benefits those who has the load of this syndrome on their shoulders. The only thing I have read coming from you is arguing against most people posting in this forum. It is my opinion, you don believe in this syndrome, so I don’t see what is your intention posting here. I am sure I am not the only one who has noticed your behavior in this forum. Jorge."

4,Floggi,130,"  I apologize for asking to keep this an open forum. Do I understand correctly that if someone asks for what boils down to censorship, nobody is allowed to reply, unless he agrees? Is there still a way for me to voice my opinion that this forum should be open, and that anyone may voice their personal experiences, or is that no longer allowed? In this case, I’m thinking about Vegan Catlady, who was the one to state that eating fruits really helped her. Is she not allowed to say that?  "
5,anna,130,"Hi Floggi You are certainly allowed to state your own opinion. However, starting your post with the below questions was clearly inflammatory and antagonistic. You did make a reasonable point later in the post about eating fruit. If that had been the main focus of the post, I would have had no reason to delete it. Best AnnaFirst: you state that “those with too little experience” should not try to help others. Question: why is it not allowed to help others? Question: how does one know when one has “too little” experience? Second: you state that only your opinion is valid, and all others are false. Question: how do you know that? Question: why are you so sure it isn’t the other way around? Question: how do you know there even exists a one-answer-fits-all approach? Third: you state that “it’s just as I say it is, all others please shut up” Question: what’s the difference between such a bold statement and the statement of doctors who say that candida infections just don’t exist, and who make you shut up if you tell them you think you suffer from candida overgrowth?“In health there is freedom. Health is the first of all liberties.” - Henri Amiel"
6,Floggi,130,"  I appreciate your response, anna. But I still don’t get what is and what is not allowed. For example, I read the post at the start of this thread as mainly stating that Vegan Catlady is all wrong when she testifies that she benefits from eating fruits. The post almost literally states that Vegan Catlady should shut up because she is dead wrong. I find such statements quite inflammatory, to be honest. If not by this post alone, then certainly for those who have followed recent conversations between dvjorge/raster and Vegan Catlady. The post that started this thread is, in my eyes, halfway between bullying and a blow below the belt. I truely do not understand why such a post is allowed, and then my questions are called “inflammatory”. Sure, my questions are antagonistic – that’s only logical given the anger I felt when I saw such a belittling of any view that differs from the poster’s, and a proposal for what is in essence censorship of such differing views. I would hate to see this forum become so narrow as to only allow one viewpoint. That would not be helpful to the many people out there who are looking for diverse and reliable information. Please don’t get my words wrong here. I’m not complaining, I’m not bashing, I’m not attacking, I’m not being inflammatory. All I want is some guidelines as to what is, and what is not considered acceptable. Or, if you don’t like long-winded questions and equally long-winded answers, let’s reshape this into two more simple questions: 1. Is it allowed for Vegan Catlady (and others) to state that she benefitted from fruit, and that she even advises others to at least try out eating fruit to experience what effect it has on their well-being? 2. If someone states that Big Evil Pharma is actively trying to turn our children into autists by injecting them with poisonous mercury because autists buy more of their evil medicine, am I then allowed to write that (at least in my country) no childhood vaccine contains any mercury, with a reference to a reputable source? Again, I’m only trying to get things clear. I know it’s impossible to describe rules of behavior in such a way that they cover all possible cases, but providing a guideline should be possible, I think. I hope you don’t mind asking all these questions. Floggi  "

0,Kelly Ann,131,"I am a 45 year old female who has suffered with candida overgrowth for years and am desperate to get my life back. Between my migraines, muscle and joint pain, allergies/chronic respiratory problems, thrush, fatigue, hormone imbalance, problems sleeping, etc., I am at my wits end. I love essential oils and herbs and have seen improvement with them, but I just haven’t been able to kill the candida. I am new to the forum, so please forgive me if this question has already been addressed, but I was wondering if Candisol along with Syntol, Red Desert Clay, and Zetox are effective, along with diet, of getting rid of candida? I would very much appreciate any help. I am a busy mother of 6, and the candida is affecting virtually every aspect of my life. Thanks for any advice!"
1,raster,131,"All candisol is is a digestive enzyme. There are many other digestive enzyme products out on the market such as pro-gest, zymex, candizyme, candex, candida digest, candida complex, etc. Each one of these products contains different enzymes which essentially destroy/weaken the cell walls that protect the candida. They also help you break down the food you eat, reducing and preventing undigested food from fermenting in the gut (and helping you get more energy from the food you eat). Syntol is a probiotic and there are many probiotic products on the market such as garden of life, megaflora, renew life, dr. mercola’s, hmf neuro, etc. Essentially the only differences between these probiotics is the strength, the amount of probiotics (CFU in billions), and the strains of bacteria. The one I recommend most is HMF neuro because it is the only human derived probiotic available in the US pretty much. There is another 6 strain human derived probiotic available in canada. Megaflora is another we recommend on the forum because it contains the DDS-1 strain which is effective for fighting candida. The clay helps you detox but it also can cause chronic constipation and this is why we don’t recommend it normally on the forum. Zetox is a zeolite product that helps detox. There are lots of other detox products on the market and this is quite possibly the most important thing you need to address when starting out. You need to prevent the die-off toxins from remaining in the body and the best way to do this is to sweat out the toxins (hot tub, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc). and to support your liver. Here is a die-off remedy post for you to check out about detoxing: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9434_Die-off-remedies-post–will-edit-more-in-time.aspx Plan on a 6-18 month recovery to get over candida overgrowth. You didn’t list any antifungal products and this is what kills the yeast. The rest of the products do other things. -raster"
2,Kelly Ann,131,"Thank you so very much for all the information! I REALLY appreciate it! Do you have any recommendations for the best antifungal products for killing candida? I am worried about how I will feel when the yeast start dying off because when I did a chelation treatment last month, my body began going into shock, and I ended up in the hospital for a few days. I am so sick and weak from the candida right now that I can barely do anything. I am very grateful for all the information you shared about detoxing- the dos and don’ts. I don’t have access to a sauna, so that worries me. I just don’t want to end up in the hospital again. One more question: do you think it’s safe to use Pure Synergy while killing the yeast for extra vitamins and minerals? I heard that green smoothies may not be good, so I wanted to make sure to ask before I use Pure Synergy. Thanks again for your advice!"
3,raster,131,"The antifungal product I recommend most is SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne. All acids essentially destroy the cell walls (think battery acid) and specific types of acids are used to fight specific organisms, bacteria, etc. For instance, citric acid is good for fighting microbes and pantethenic acid is good for fighting something else (maybe viruses?). I would start out with one capsule per day and work your way up slowly to whatever you can afford in the long run (I take 9 per day or 3 per meal). The more antifungals you take, the worse your die-off will be so its not a more the merrier type of thing. Another good antifungal that is great for starting out is garlic (raw or capsule). The problem with garlic is it is also anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, etc. (variety of properties). This might be good when starting out because you could have a variety of flora that have overgrown such as parasites, bacteria, h.pylori, microbes, etc. and not just candida. When your digestion slows it benefits all of the bad bugs essentially. There are ton of other ones such as oregano oil, grapefruit seed extract, etc. The next one I would consider is consuming pure organic coconut oil. If you were to consume one spoonful per day starting out, this would be a good antifungal product. The problem is it can be quite expensive if you work your way up to a large dose (like 10+ spoonfuls per day). But starting out you likely wont be able to tolerate more than a spoonful. Coconut oil also contains an acid (I think its caprylic acid) and this has the same properties as the other acids. -raster"
4,raster,131,The main problem with the superfood thing you mentioned is the grasses it contains. These likely will cause you to get the runs (aka diarrhea) within a few days so I wouldn’t consume this product. The chlorophyll could be a chelating agent too and you don’t want that unless you are prepared. -raster
5,Kelly Ann,131,"Thanks for all the information! I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it! I was thinking I would buy the website’s internet program, so I would have a timeline, recipes, etc. But I do have a concern. Being yeast free in 2 months sounds wonderful, but I’m not sure if that is feasible for me. With my organs not functioning like they should, I worry that may cause more damage to them and also prevent me from getting rid of the die-off candida effectively. Am I off-base? Your protocol sounds great! Thanks for sharing and for working so hard to help others suffering from candida!"
6,raster,131,"You should be concerned kelly because the die-off toxins can cause damage to your liver and kidneys, and unless this is prevented, you will have to heal this at a later time. This is why I decided to seek professional advice from a naturopath who has over 20 years experience treating yeast and candida. The treating yourself route can be problematic and everyone needs different supplements to address their own health problems. The best method to get better in my opinion is to heal multiple organs at once all at the same time . Another potential thing that can happen is you feel way worse after trying to treat yourself. For instance, you could harm your thyroid, adrenals, or have perpetual die-off that lasts forever, etc. These are all problems that take special treatments and should not be treated on your own in my opinion. I’ve been on the diet for over 2 years and am symptom free most of the time, but when I cheat it can set me back. Its going to be another few more years for me to get where I want and this is even with a naturopath! -raster"
7,Kelly Ann,131,"That’s what I think, too. Thanks to you and my research I feel I will be better prepared for healing, more knowledgeable, and my treatment will go better. But I doubt I can do this without a naturopath because I have too many problems since I’ve had candida overgrowth for so many years. Thanks so very much for all your advice and sharing your knowledge. I am very grateful!!!! I wish you the best on your road to recovery. God Bless you"

9,Kelly Ann,131,"That makes me feel good. Thanks. I know I can heal. I just know it may take a while, and I can’t wait to be free of this plague. I am so grateful to finally know what it is. Over the years, my doctors have never even suggested it was yeast though a chiropractor suspected it 7 years ago and sent me for extensive blood work. The blood work showed that indeed I had candida overgrowth, and he put me on a low carb diet. It made me feel a little better, but he didn’t explain the problem very well or discuss how to cure it. I’m not blaming him. It’s just that I didn’t understand it at the time or the negative effects of not treating it and forgot about it. Soon I gave up the low carb diet as well. The years of not treating it took their toll, and two years ago, I was desperate to find answers and began the process of going to doctors again. I have spent a fortune in medical bills and had so many horrible side effects from the many medications I was given for all my symptoms- migraines, hormones, asthma and allergies, joint and muscle aches, inflammation, sleep problems, acid reflux and ulcer, thrush/yeast infections, etc. etc. The next recommendation was to start the road to the urologist. I am not criticizing any one doctor, and I don’t have anything against going to the doctor. My brother is a doctor. It’s just it was a long, expensive, fruitless, disheartening journey. Finally, I began seeing a naturopath. My naturopath (actually I see two, and I like them both. One has been in business for years and years and will likely retire before too much longer. The other is young and hasn’t been in business for too many years, but he is also very good) found the candida right off and began the process of strengthening my organs and helping me get rid of parasites, so I would be ready to deal with the candida. But then I had a bad setback with the hospital experience I told you about. Now I am a bit stronger and ready to begin the healing process. I would like to get a good book to guide me as the naturopaths help me because I feel I will better understand the treatment and the condition in general. But I don’t want to go it alone for treatment. I’m scared I guess. I don’t want to end up back in the hospital. Anyway, thanks for listening and for all your help. I am feeling very hopeful. I just pray I can make the diet changes. I need to lose 20 pounds to get to my ideal weight. I know the change in eating habits will help me in a lot of ways, but right now, I crave sugar a lot, and I know it won’t be easy. But I am ready to begin. So ready. Thanks again for your encouragement and help!"
10,pinkyrat2,131,I was just Googled to buy some Candisol and I saw your question. I had a multiyear saga with yeast infections myself. I went to many doctors and took all sort of antifungal drugs to no avail. Then I went to a naturopath who tried a number of ridiculous things before suggesting Candisol. I took it for a couple of months and my yeast problem went away! At this point I can’t actually remember if I used it in conjunction with boric acid suppositories but I probably did. Now when I get the first signs of a yeast infection (which only happens after a ridiculous amount of sugar) I use dissolved boric acid in a dropper for a day or two. If that doesn’t take care of the problem I take Candisol for two weeks and it goes away again for another 6 months or so. I really really love it because it saved my sanity. I always make sure I have some when I am out of town…

I do not appreciate you mocking/provoking me about my health…about my personal health protocol on my birthday of all days, thank you very much. I mean I have an opinion, but you don’t see me picking apart the stuff you are doing in your protocol other than the foods you eat. If you want to attack me, I have some stuff to say to you: I sometimes wonder if the stuff you post is misinformation because its pretty upsetting to have someone come along and say/suggest the exact opposite of what I’ve been doing on here for awhile and then attack me like this. It seems like you have strong beliefs about not consuming meat but this is no need to point things out about another person and this is almost the bullying type of behavior that you spoke out against recently. I am not bullying/attacking you, I am just doing what I’ve been doing here for the last few years which is to try to be helpful also and potentially protect other people with different opinions. I think its important for everyone to consume meat and I honestly don’t think you can get better without it, especially because of my ND’s belief in consuming meat with his 20-30 years of treating people with health problems. If you have serious mineral deficiencies, which most people do who have a candida problem…meat consumption can greatly benefit your health and I am just saying that you should think twice and twice again before suggesting people do drastic dietary changes like you suggest. For instance, my wife was vegetarian for 3+ years and once she started to consume meat 3x per day, her health greatly improved with the candida diet. So I have not one, but 2 people’s experiences to pull from when I share information on here… Eating crappy grade chicken with antibiotics/growth hormones is a big difference when compared to free range stuff…do some research before you attack me on this. I was a cigarrette smoker for 15 years and quit mid december last year and this is why I couldn’t get better on the diet as much as I’d like and make as much progress as I’d like in my personal health journey. But guess what, I still got significantly better and completely healed leaky gut while smoking. You should do some research on candida and cigarrettes because the yeast lives on that shit. I feel a ton better once I quit smoking and I honestly feel like I defeated candida at this point in my treatment. I drank some alcohol today (first time in a year), I ate some chocolate chip cookies, a hamburger and fries, etc. and no reactions or setbacks really. I feel really good in general and this is a big milestone in my health compared to the heart palpitations I used to get, the headaches, the allergic reactions (burning skin), anxiety, brain fog, constipation, fatigue, etc. Those symptoms were miserable and debilitating. I had something like 30+ symptoms, which is a much more severe case than what most people have experienced on here. I’ve cured almost all of it and I honestly think I’ll be going in a healthy direction for life. I’ve helped a lot of people here and I’d hate to have to leave because of paltry attacks like this. I just feel it isn’t worth the energy to have to explain myself like this because of someones misguided efforts. I think someone needs to take a look in the mirror because this post is ridiculous. -raster"

This is only a struggle until you familiarize yourself with the world of veggies, because honestly, there are only hundreds of ideas for meals to choose from, and none of them have to include pasta,rice,or bread 🙂 BTW, you *will* get there….Im hesitant to say im cured but I had an excellent week so far, and it included fruit, brownies and sugared-lemonade….so im getting there 😀"

Thank you!! There are different diets available. The most popular is the more strict diet, which most people follow. It only includes a strict amount of veggies/meat. See the safe food list. Fruits are not allowed on the strict diet. Personally I’d advise against the strict diet for the ones that haven’t tried anything yet. Try to eat as healthy as possible for a few weeks and combine it with antifungals. If the problem solves itself this way, you are better off than doing the strict diet. If it doesn’t, then you have to start the strict diet."
4,raster,133,"I recommend a stage 3 diet first, then stage 2, then stage 1 for a long period of time and then back through the stages later in time.

This is the recipes section: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_topics6_Candida-Food-and-Recipes.aspx The diet by itself likely won’t cure you, the x-factor in most treatments is the supplements they take. Try not to overdo anything at first. Keep in mind that the more antifungals you take the more die-off you’ll get. Also, come up with a detox plan before starting if possible…this is essential to do this safely imho. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9434_Die-off-remedies-post–will-edit-more-in-time.aspx -raster"

They can advise you on the correct products to get for your budget. I think a basic setup costs less than $100 and you have to replace some of the tubs every few months or so (these are like $20 each)….its very much way superior than a brita, etc. If you have any kind of skin/scalp problems you should get something else for the shower… =raster"

4,ThomasJoel2,135,"Thanks for the heads up. Here’s the blog post: After watching some reviews on YouTube and considering the recommendations given for Berkey water filters, I went ahead and ordered the Travel Berkey along with the Berkey Fluoride Water Filter- PF2. http://www.berkeyfilters.com/ http://www.berkeyfilters.com/berkey-water-filters/systems/travel-berkey.html http://www.berkeyfilters.com/berkey-water-filters/specialty-filters/fluoride.html The Black Berkey filters that come with the system filter out 99% of arsenic, but the fluoride filter takes care of arsenic as well. Between the two, I should have virtually NO arsenic left in my water. http://www.berkeyfilters.com/berkey-answers/performance/filtration-specifications/ I can see why the Berkey systems are so popular. The filters last 16 years if you use a gallon of water a day, 8 years if you use 2 gallons a day. Someone calculated that out to be 2 cents a gallon. All of the Berkey’s are freestanding, so they don’t have to be hooked up to a water supply, so they’re portable and easy to transport. The water tastes very good, and looks sparkling clear. It took me several days of watching videos and trouble-shooting how to prime the filters, but we finally got it. Our water pressure was low in the kitchen sink, so we ended up soaking them for a couple hours to better prime them. Even with that though, the flow rate was slow to none. We then tried the faucet in the laundry room, which has much better water pressure, and the filters quickly beaded up as they’re supposed to. The Black Berkey filters go in the top tank (where you dump the unfiltered water), and the fluoride filters go into the bottom. They screw into each other, so the bottom tank ends up filling with the filtered water, and you dispense from the spigot on the bottom tank. It takes a couple hours for most of the water to filter through, and there’s still an inch or so that remains in the top tank. I believe it said in the manual that it’ll take about 20 gallons to reach the maximum filtration rate, so we’ll see how things speed up with time and use. I’m relieved to have water that is virtually metal free (95%+), fluoride free, virus free, bacteria free, and largely chlorine free. I can now drink in peace 🙂 Here’s a couple YouTube reviews that I found helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC9iN_Kyico https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph3D6OVGJsA"
0,Nowhere,136,"Hey guys I’d like to share my approach to fighting my Candida with y’all and see what you guys think. So I stumbled across this website after trying Gaps out and doing a lot of hard yards and feeling stuck. http://drlwilson.com/index.htm now Dr Wilson is an interesting guy, hes written about 1000 articles about health related issues and it’s all there for free for you to read about. Some of the stuff he talks about is pretty strange at first but a lot of it just makes sense and it resonated with me. He offers a “Nutritional balancing” program and thats what I currently do. Because its a lot to read through I’ll summarize and tell you my favorite things he’s taught me and that I hope are helping cure my Candida. Ok so firstly he taught me to eat meals in a relaxed manner, eat only one or two vegetables with 150g max of protein at a time and to relax for 10 min after. Don’t use many flavourings, keep it simple and take it easy. Next he suggests the use of a near infra red sauna, which heats your body up and relaxes your immune system, which aids digestion and helps your body do its repairs. Candida likes the cold so the heat can help disable it. Also another goody for Candida specifically is deep breathing which helps to oxygenate your cells, and this is bad news for the anabolic Yeast. Finally he taught me about Macrobiotics… A lot of people disregard this or just don’t believe it’s true but it makes sense to me, so basically his recommended diet cuts out Yin foods, and Candida is a Yin condition. Anyways read about it if your interested, I love reading articles from his site, their fascinating, especially all the spiritual stuff. I don’t agree with everything he says, like to watch Fox news : / but I am in a pretty good space following his program although it’s hard when you cant meet with your practitioner face to face. He responds to my emails though which is nice. I recommend getting on the program. Also this is something new I found which has really refocused my life positively. It’s a bit heavy and deep, its spiritual stuff and its controversial but it kinda blew my mind and really profoundly impacted me. I love it, if you’ve got an open mind and patience and courage you might be interested in this http://www.truthcontest.com/entries/the-present-universal-truth/ I think my body is kinda happy atm, I’m not cured of my IBS and all my problems, but I think I am on the right track and all it needs is peace and time to fix itself. So in the meantime I don’t feel like I need to focus on the Candida and all this spiritual stuff has become my primary focus it gives me a reason to live beyond just trying to fix my body which had been my obsession."

2,Nowhere,136,"Yeah I always make meal time special now :). I meticulously cook my food to perfection, at the right temp not to burn or over heat, with the right amount of seasoning, all in balance and enjoy it in as peaceful a setting as I can find. I then practice the meditation I linked from the truth contest, which I think is truly marvelous and I can usually sit there perfectly happy for like an hour if I have the time. It’s all about enjoying the journey, no matter how bumpy the ride. Anyways I know all this stuff is a lot to digest, it’s taken me about 2 years to go from someone who’s life was riddled with addiction and angst and despair to the peace loving philosophical life loving state I’m in now. Make a choice and take the first step to happiness and forgive yourself for any mistakes you make along the way because it will get easier you will go from glory to glory if you stay committed. People underestimate what their capable of, I believe Jesus was just an ordinary human being, and look what he did. Also thought I’d add to that list of highlights from Dr Wilson. The Near Infrared Sauna is a gentle way of detoxifying the body of heavy metals, which have been talked about on this forum as a source of Candida. Also he gives you a whole bunch of Supplements to take, and the most important one in my opinion is the Digestive Enzyme, best taken halfway through or at the end of a meal to let your own enzymes have a chance to activate, it helps to kill Yeast in the stomach and also improves digestion."
0,pinkbow,137,"I love nuts, peanuts in particular. I eat them on a daily basis and often over-indulge. But I am almost sure my body has difficulties digesting them.

I will try for a week to cut them all out now and see if there is a difference. Anyway, I read that soaking nuts and then sticking them in a dehydrator will make them easier to digest. And then from there I can make some butter and control how long I have them stored for rather than buying them pre-made. Has anyone had any success with this method?

I also knew people that didnt want to hear when some new virus was labeled, what the life expectancy of someone with their habits was, or what the chances were a storm would hit a month from now. Basically they took things as they came, lived for today, and rarely experienced drama. Those people bored me,lol.

Pretty much like-attracts-like, and birds-of-a-feather….you get it.

I read the encouraging information now, because its my experience that my attention on the positive is serving me much better than my attention on “but if you dont take this,rotate that, buy this,have this test done,ect” .  Seriously, I spent alot of money and got increasingly depressed. You’ll notice that for all the tests and supplements and routines, there is no one in line waiting to post that they are cured (meaning no preventative supplements). So take these articles into consideration. Humor them. If nothing else, if you choose not to change your perspective, atleast these articles took time away from worrying more. “Optimism seems to reduce stress-induced inflammation and levels of stress hormones such as cortisol. It may also reduce susceptibility to disease by dampening sympathetic nervous system activity and stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The latter governs the so-called “rest and digest” response – the opposite of fight-or-flight.” http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128271.700-heal-thyself-think-positive.html#.UzrmB6L-pj5 “Assessing a patient’s mood and attitude may now give orthopaedic surgeons a better forecast in determining recovery.” http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/46615.php An article 10 years ago!  “The scientific recognition of a mind-body connection in health is gathering steam. Once the purview of new-age books that claim to show the path to healing, the evidence is in the rise in clinical trials: The NIH last year funded $143 million of mind-body research, with estimates of $149 million for 2004 and $153 million for 2005.”  http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-10-12-mind-body_x.htm Candace Pert = brilliant. “More recent research by Candice Pert, a neuropharmacologist, explained the workings of neuropeptides, the chemical messengers that are essential to the mind-body relationship. She found them on both the brain’s cell walls and on those of the immune system. Their presence in both demonstrates their close relationship, which means the brain and emotions are closely related to the immune system as messages are transmitted back and forth. Pert also showed how the endocrine system with its hormones plays a part. Simply put, as long as it is all balanced, health is maintained. But, as Cannon showed, once a stressor causes an emotional imbalance, the immune system suffers and disease can overcome it.” http://www.naturalnews.com/023656_body_cancer_stress.html Why you might want to choose uplifting material: “The new biology takes this further. It is not just the power of suggestion, but the actual thoughts and words chosen by the person which changes brain chemistry. We have 50 trillion cells in our body which communicate through neurochemical and vibration signals. Bruce H. Lipton, PhD, has done a large amount of work in this field, which is called epigenetics. The word epigenetics literally means “above the genes”, i.e., the mind controls the genes. Dr. Lipton says our minds can re-write our genes. He compares the cell to a computer chip, as each is a bit of information. Both can receive information through different routes and cause a reaction. Epigenetics changes our paradigm of control. The old physics believed the universe is based on matter. The new biology is based on the idea that the universe is governed by energy.

1,Vegan Catlady,140,"“An experiment done by one university showed the effects of the emotional state on how the body responds to cholesterol. Four actors were hired to play two couples who had been close friends for years. They were getting together to share a meal (pizza) and talk about fond memories. A blood sample was taken prior to the meal, and another sample after the meal. The blood (after the meal) was then tested for cholesterol. Granted, it was there, but later, when tested again, it had “disappeared.” Something in the blood had broken it down. The experiment was repeated, but this time each person was to act as if they were almost mortal enemies, and anger and resentment permeated the meal. The same amounts of pizza were then consumed by each person, complete with the same precisely measured amount of cheese. This time, the cholesterol did not dissipate within the blood sample. Remember, the only variable was the state of mind, yet the cholesterol (lipid) in the blood was measurably affected. It becomes evident then that to really be healthy and do the best we can, we have to take into account beliefs and mental attitude concerning food.” Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/027134_food_beliefs_body.html#ixzz2xeczGmvU http://www.naturalnews.com/027254_body_emotion_food.html I purposefully left out all the newest info that sounded too new-agey for people to get into,even if it is supported by a science-based outlet and audience.

It’s something that is very hard, and often even impossible, to explain to those who are in a fearful or antagonistic state of mind. It’s kind of self-psycho-therapy that really helps change one’s attitude, one’s perspective, one’s state of mind – and, therefore, one’s well-being and one’s health.Vegan Catlady;56079 wrote: I read the encouraging information now, because its my experience that my attention on the positive is serving me much better than my attention on “but if you dont take this,rotate that, buy this,have this test done,ect” .Right!!!

What you are describing here is like a double-edged sword: you are reducing the stress that comes your way, and you are changing the way you react to the remaining stress.Vegan Catlady;56079 wrote: An article 10 years ago!This is indeed nothing new. In fact, I’ve just finished the book Thinking, Fast and Slow of Daniel Kahneman. He did a lot of experiments to investigate the effect of human attitude on well-being. One of his experiments involved asking the subjects to put a pencil between their teeth. The pencil was from left to right, the subject had to gently bit it in the middle (just enough to prevent the pencil from falling), and they were not allowed to touch the pencil with their lips. This was a trick to make the subjects smile without them being aware that they were smiling. But even this kind of a very twisted smile made subject feel more happy. Their increased happiness showed in lots of experimental results. That’s how simple it can be to radically change your life – go figure!

0,emzie89,141,"Hi all, I am looking for some guidance and help, and hoping anyone can help. For the past 3 months i have been living with a 24/7 spaced out feeling that is ruining my life. I have sensitivity to light/sound. My light sensitivity is so bad that even bedroom lights are really hard for me to tolerate, and i often have to have to turn lights off, and resort to lamps with less bright lighting. Also highly sensitive to noise, even someone coughing can sound really loud to me and bothers my ears. I also have chronic post nasal drip, itchy ears, reoccurring vaginal yeast infections, terrible digestive issues (although i had digestive problems a few months before all these symptoms started), sore throat, constant dry mouth, which makes me thirsty, achy all over, especially my neck, shoulders, tingling in hands and feet, and temple headaches.I also have had urgency/frequency/burning while urinating. I have been to a urologist for this, who said there is microscopic blood in my urine. He did a cystoscopy to rule out anything serious, and said everything looked fine, but we still have not found the underlying cause for this problem. Watching tv, driving, and computer make this worse as i really have to concentrate, and react to certain foods. This all started when i found out i was pregnant in December, and a week previous to that i had some dental work done (The pregnancy was a bit of a surprise). I would start feeling spaced out every now and then and get mild headaches while pregnant, but it would come and go and was not constant. I put it down to hormones and pregnancy. A couple of weeks later i miscarried, and was fine for 3 weeks. Then, randomly out of nowhere one day the spaced out feeling came back, and has been constant since. I have had a ct scan which came back normal, celiac was negative, and diabetes and anemia were negative. I did see a gastro who prescribed me nystatin, as my stool sample came back with a little more yeast than usual. He did not explain to me about candida, or a diet, he just said to take the nystatin for 10 days, and it did not help at all. I actually wondered what too much yeast meant, and googled it and came to find candida, which i had no knowledge about beforehand. My questions are: 1) Does this sound like yeast overgrowth? I mean it really sounds like what the issue is to me, but i don’t know if it is where to start 2) Is it true people with only weakened immune systems have systematic candida, like those with HIV/AIDS/Cancer? I also have no history of recent antibiotic use before this occurred. Can pregnancy cause this? 3) Why don’t doctors recognize this as a problem unless you have HIV/AIDS? This is seriously making me miserable. I had to drop out of my last semester because i cannot think straight, and my head is always foggy/and i feel constantly high. If candida is the problem, this is torture, and i don’t know how doctors don’t help people with this. 4) What doctor can help me? I was talking to someone who said they to had all tests run for everything to come back normal, and when yeast was found through a doctor she went to, he prescribed diflucan. With the diet and meds, it completely cleared up and she felt normal again, but the problem was as soon as she finished the meds, it came right back. Can anyone offer me advice, and also do some people just never get cured from this? I can’t imagine living this way forever. My husband and i want to start a family, but i can’t feeling this way."

Im glad your addressing this, as you will MISERABLE if you start a family before getting this handled. You will be giving the baby your illness, as they will wind up with bad colic for months, pain, thrush, bleeding diaper rashes, its awful. My baby suffered, and not one doctor knew what the hell was going on. Not one. I was given antibiotics for a kidney infection during pregnancy. He had cradle-cap (candida) Thrush (candida) Bad diaper rash (candida) Colic that had him crying in agony for hours on end,everyday,no exception. I had to be treated with nystatin topically since I was nursing him. So….with all this said, where to start? After doing research, I totally freaked out thinking I contracted some deadly disease that made me immuno-compromised. I had jobs in my past that required testing, and to this day I test negative for HIV,hepatitis, and few others I cant pronounce. So why are we all getting yeast over-growth? For everyone its different. Some have high mercury or lead levels. That will cause yeast overgrowth according to research. Some have taken antibiotics,some quite a bit of antibiotics (thats my problem) Some have coupled a very poor diet with illness,which allowed for the vulnerability to yeast overgrowth. If you do some reading on this forum, you will see many many reasons. Bad nutrition,deficiencies, poisonings, different things can lower the immune system, including adrenal-burn-out and backed-up lymph. Your job is to detect your issues, and then one addressed, the candida will be easier to treat. It will take a year to take care of. If you get pregnant before then, it will not be fun for you or the baby. Doctors do NOT acknowledge this. I saw a regular MD and an ER doctor,both laughed me off. Thousands of dollars later, I want only for them both to get a bad candida infection,lol. Consider seeing a naturopathic doctor. They acknowledge candida overgrowth. My MD called herself “naturopathic” because she sold vitamins out of her office. Do your research and find one that isnt quick to throw pharmaceuticals at you, because most infections do not respond to them long-term. You CAN get better.It will just take time 🙂"

Since you had some dental work done recently, it can point in that direction. Combined with a change of hormones, it can have pushed the candida ‘over the edge’. Do you have any blood results?

This is because candida is not really a disease on itself. It is more like a symptom of a sick body. Taking antifungals without adressing the real problem only suppresses the symptoms. A lot of things can not be seen in a blood test. For example, adrenal insufficiency can is very hard to diagnose via a blood test since cortisol levels should be different during the day. The best way to figure out what you have is to look at your symptoms. Most people have adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism. Search around (on the forum) to check if your symptoms agree. Blood tests usually only show things when something is seriously wrong (eg Addison’s disease). You should go find a naturopath. They usually understand how candida works and how it should be fixed. This is recommended but not necessary. If you don’t find a naturopath (lilke me), you’re kind of on your own which is perfectly feasible. It will only take longer. The closest I came to a naturopath is an allergist.emzie89;55976 wrote: Can anyone offer me advice, and also do some people just never get cured from this? I can’t imagine living this way forever. My husband and i want to start a family, but i can’t feeling this way. There are a few success stories on this forum. But curing chronic candida is hard, because you have to treat everything at once. An if you can’t find the underlying problem (in your case it can be the combination of antibiotics and pregnancy), you’re gonna have a hard time curing yourself."

Amalgam fillings are 50% mercury, cause serious health problems, and are a very common cause for developing candida in addition to numerous other symptoms you listed such as sensitivity to light and sound. Check out the link below. If you have/had amalgam fillings this is the cause you will want to investigate. Even if you haven’t had any amalgams I still encourage you to investigate this issue. http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/chelationnetwork/chelation-the-andy-cutler-protocol/"

I keep reading about being seriously ill to have this happen, so it really worries me. The effects of mercury poisoning are often not felt immediately. It takes time to accumulate a toxicity. It is very common for negative effects to be delayed for quite some time, even decades, making it very difficult for many to identify the source of their health problems. This is why mercury poisoning goes so often undiagnosed."

I keep reading about being seriously ill to have this happen, so it really worries me. The effects of amalgams on the amount of mercury in the body have been studied over and over again. No effect was ever found. This means that your observation is correct: you’ve had those fillings for many years, and (of course) they never caused problems – and they never will cause problems. Since there is so much scaremongering since the Internet allowed such fear to spread faster then ever before, even more very detailed studies have been performed. Researchers even went so far as to resort to the best testing method available: they took samples of almost all organs of deceased persons (who, of course, allowed this in their will), to rigorously measure the amount of mercury in their bodies. The result of this study: there is no relation whatsoever between the amount of amalgam fillings and the number of years these fillings have been in the mouth, and the amount of mercury in whichever body organ. There is also no relation whatsoever between the amount of amalgam fillings and the number of years these fillings have been in the mouth, and the complaints or illnesses that were reported by the deceased before they died. As usual, you only need to follow the money. Who would benefit from an amalgam scare? The answer is obvious: those dentists who offer the (generally expensive) replacement of amalgam fillings with composite fillings. Luckily, most dentists adhere to scientific findings, and they keep the best interest of their patients in mind. These responsible dentists do not go after the big easy money. A minority, though, does go for big easy bucks, and they offer needless and useless interventions. Please stay sane. Don’t fall for them.  "

0,Vegan Catlady,143,"If nobody tells you,how do you know what to look for when taking a new supplement or food? Many of us will only give advice from experience, and even then it does not mean that what is recommended for you to try is SAFE FOR YOU. There are risks to taking antifungals, some of them can cause a great deal of stress and adverse reaction. The same with new foods,vitamins, and probiotics. For example, those on medications should be researching every new thing they ingest to see if they are contraindicated. Even grapefruit can be devastating with some prescriptions. Some people with bleeding issues should be aware that many of the most-recommended supplements can cause excessive bleeding. Pretty serious with an ulcer, or other medical condition. These are some examples: Some antifungals (like garlic,oregano,cayenne,cinnamon,clove,turmeric,peppermint,ginger,ect ) Medicinal herbs including red clover,chamomile,anise,fenugreek,licorice, parsley,and foods like flax, berries,grapes,citrus,honey,cider,vinegar,onions,celery seed, olive oil ect Omega 3 fatty acids like flax, fish, fish oils Vitamin E Devils Claw and Vitamin E are a guaranteed bleeding risk. This list is by no means exhaustive. Please research every medication and supplement you ingest. Dont assume because they are “natural” or many people have taken it that there are no risks. Always research. I was inspired to post this due to wanting to take ibuprofen (thins the blood) for pain and knowing that i could not with all the antifungals in my body at the time."

0,annieamanda,144,"I have been sick (like not able to leave my house sick) for over 2 years now. Started GAPS diet soon after – been on GAPS diet for 1 year 8 months now. Spent entire life savings on every doctor and specialist in CA (8 MRIs, allergy tests, CT scans, etc). Been to 6 different homeopaths, accupuncture, chiropractor, reiki – you name it I’ve tried it. Flew out and spent two months admitted to the Cleveland Clinic. Diagnosed with systemic Candida (at cleveland clinic) 1.5 years ago. Followed by 3 months of prescription anti fungal 2x a day. Along with Candida Diet (on top of GAPS) and supplements (l-glutamine, fish oil, coconut oil, etc). Daily coffee enema. Still struggled with daily symptoms or I would get better for no longer than 3 days then all my symptoms would come back (no cheating – EVER!). After 6 months GAPS/Candida I started BodyEcology diet. Symptoms got worse even after 6 months. Now 1.5 years later I’m still GAPS/Candida and now I think I have a Salicylate sensitivity on top of everything. Still daily symptoms – still can’t leave house. Still too dizzy to walk from room to room most days. Still brain fog and feels like stroke symptoms after eating. Had to give up all kraut, supplements and coconut oil because of salicylate sensitivity. All 3 gastro docs, intregrative specialist at cleveland clinic and homeopaths all have now given up and each in turn has asked I not make new appointments (seriously, each in their own way said “I can’t help you anymore – go see your primary doctor”). Primary doctor threw his hands up over a year ago and said “just keep searching” I am down to 5 foods I can eat (and still have symptoms everyday). Leeks, cauliflower, iceberg lettuce and fermented raw milk viilli yogurt. Even chicken broth gives me symptoms of asthma, brain fog and stroke now. Still have candida overgrowth. Truly at a loss! Please help!!!"
1,annieamanda,144,"PS. No amalgam fillings. Done chelation for 4 months and Alpha Liopic Acid for 6 months. Didn’t help. Taken homeopathic supplements for parasites, viruses and etc. Didn’t help."
2,Wiley200,144,Have you looked into to hormone imbalances such as low cortisol or low thyroid hormone.
3,annieamanda,144,"Wiley200 – Thank you for the reply. Yes, I have had my thyroid tested 4 times in the past 2 years. All tests normal. Someone suggested I try the Raw Milk diet. Is that beneficial for Candida? My diet now is 75% viili yogurt fermented from raw milk. When combining the Candida and Histamine/Salicylate diet I’m left with: asparagus cauliflower green beans beef (allergic to chicken and eggs) leeks  celery iceberg lettuce I still take Vitamin C, B12, Amazing Foods scoop in the am, Zypan (digestive enzyme with HCL) And absolutely no supplements to combat candida like coconut oil or grapefruit extract. Has anyone dealt with both? Any ideas on how to treat both? Am incredibly depressed with suicidal thoughts. I tried eating a handful of almonds 2 weeks ago which brought on throbbing colon (diverticulitis likely) with migraine headache that lasted 6 hours a day for 7 days straight after eating anything at all even water. They got so bad I woke up from being unconscious for about 10 minutes a couple times. Wished I hadn’t woken up at all. amanda"
4,ThomasJoel2,144,"First off, sorry to hear you’re doing so poorly. Having suicidal thoughts has got to be terrible, but I urge you to stay strong and keep looking for answers. When you chelated with ALA did you chelate according to the Andy Cutler protocol with an every 3 hour dosing schedule? If you have a mercury problem and take infrequent doses of ALA you can make the problem worse by inadvertently moving mercury into the brain. This can cause depression and suicidal thoughts like you mentioned."
5,TheChosenOne,144,What TomasJoel2 said. Improper chelating can significantly worsen your situation. Have you been diagnosed with mercury poisoning? When was the last time you have been diagnosed with candida? Why do you eat such a low variety of food?
6,annieamanda,144,"How do I do a mercury poison test? Through my primary doctor? I haven’t been diagnosed with candida since cleveland a year ago but I continue to have symptoms (raging yeast infections, brain fog, short and long term memory issues, etc) and the spit test is always positive for candida. My low variety of food is based on a combination of GAPS, Candida and Salicylate diets. Whenever I try to add anything my symptoms get exponentially worse: uncontrollable dizziness, migraines that last for 5-7 days, spastic colon, severe back pain (I’ve spontaneously ruptured 1 disc and herniated 3 more), stroke like feeling and much more – I just can’t get my brain to form the words."

The best test for mercury is a hair elements analysis test, which you can order online without going through a doctor. Here’s a link: http://www.integrativepsychiatry.net/hair_elements_hair_analysis_test.html If you were to go to your primary doctor and ask to be tested for mercury they would likely give you a blood test which is an ineffective diagnostic tool. Since mercury is stored in various bodily tissue, a blood test would only be useful in the case of an acute exposure. What was you’re dosing schedule when you used ALA? The reason I ask is because if you take ALA improperly (anything other than an every 3 hour dosing schedule) and you have a mercury problem you can make yourself significantly worse by moving mercury into your brain. This would explain the neurological symptoms you’re currently experiencing. If you did use ALA on an improper dosing schedule I highly recommend you check out Andy Cutler’s chelation protocol. He has two books that are must-reads if you are mercury toxic: Amalgam Illness and Hair Test Interpretation. I should mention that I’m not in any way financially tied to Cutler, I just think if you’re going to chelate his protocol is by far the safest and most effective method presently known. I will also add that just because you don’t have any amalgams doesn’t mean you aren’t mercury toxic. Mercury exposure can come from other sources: toxicity passed in utero (if you’re mom had mercury toxicity/amalgam fillings), fish, vaccines, flu shots or other inoculations. I became poisoned after eating a high fish diet and am currently convinced that mercury is the major catalyst behind my health problems and that chelation is a necessary and major part of the eventual solution. Here’s a torrent of Cutler’s Amalgam Illness, in case you’re strapped for money: http://kickass.to/andrew-hall-cutler-amalgam-illness-t6533350.html"

Please help!!! I hope this proves that limiting our diets might offer some symptom relief- but it does NOTHING for the candida! You cant starve it! It adapts! I am no authority and havent been suffering for years yet, just months, but I refuse to live low carb. The reason is that it seems the longer I eat low carb, the sharper the punishment is when a food is too high in natural sugar. I believe eating low carb teaches our bodies to exaggerate our reaction to sugar, and limit our diets further. This cant be the answer. Our immune systems demands calories. Any clue how much lettuce and cauliflower you need to eat just to maintain breathing? I have a clue. Going raw vegan for a little while teaches you to consume on a much larger scale. No one hear is going to get any relief when they are restricting calories. I dont know much, but I do know that. Just stressing eats calories. Our brains need glucose. Thats what im told. We aint getting glucose on a low carb diet unless we eat more. I can see this candida diet working if the consumption of calories is adequate. I was getting terribly depressed about this. I got mad and said screw it and ate an entire pomegranate tonight. Im waiting for hells bells,no lie. Turns out, pomegranate might be slightly anti-fungal…the sugar elicited only a slight reaction (although the reaction could be heartburn,too, from a messed up diet that has transitioned from raw to whatever-will-not-make-me-postal.) BUT the fructose changed my attitude 100% and tonight I will not panic-attack myself to sleep. Point isnt to throw your hands up and eat fruit, but to consider experimenting with small bites of different high calorie foods to keep your brain and immune system happy. When was the last time you had a blood panel done? Have you had your vitamin levels checked, like D and Iron and B12? I know that some people take supplements but never absorb what they take thanks to yeast or whatever, so they really arent catching up on any deficits. Even though Dr. Jeff McCombs doesnt cater to a vegan, his candida plan makes sense to me. Of course im new, so maybe I will find it useless over time…but I like his theory that we have to keep candida from fighting our antifungals by allowing the yeast to live, and keeping it from from transitioning to its fungal form. I think Low carbing makes it go fungal because its freaking out for food…and then it stays this way and makes us terribly ill. I mean, a pomegranate shouldnt give someone heartburn. Not normal. I hope you get relief <3"

Did you take supplements to support your liver? Or you have have some serious immune problems. You should check your adrenals and/or your thyroid. I agree, just take your body temp a few times a day for the next couple days and see what it’s at. That’s one of the best ways to see how your thyroid is doing. When I first started I was around 95.8-96.0 now I’m around 97-98. Look into buying a bile acid supplement, jarrow makes a good one called bile acid factors. The liver is a catch 22, it can completely regrow and heal itself, but only effectively in the presence of bile. So if your liver is already damaged and bile production is low it wont heal as quickly. Supplementing with bile will trigger it to heal. It will also help to sanitize your small intestine and I’m almost positive you have stuff in there that should not be there. I think it’s also important to look into how your body is detoxing. Are you helping it? Sauna, rebounding, massage, bowel movements(at least 2 a day)? I think impossible has said that some people genetically can’t detox certain mycotoxins, I don’t know enough about that but maybe if he reads this he can give more info."
12,annieamanda,144,Thanks guys – I am looking into hair testing for mercury. I was tested months ago with muscle testing and it came out negative – but going to give it another go with hair analysis. Amanda
13,raster,144,"So you need to tell us what supplements you have tried and complications you have had from them. Another thing to keep in mind is that all of this testing does not always indicate a problem…for instance you could still have a thyroid problem even though it doesn’t show up in the test. The testing can be completely inconclusive as you can see… You are starving yourself by limiting the foods you eat and you need to start branching out some if possible. Have you tried SF722 undecenoic acid? If you want to go to my naturopath here in Portland, he can treat people remotely. I’ve sent 4-5 other forum members to him who have reached dead ends and he has helped them all. Another thing I would do is stop panicking! This is a long term battle and don’t worry about the past 2 years… Have you tried anything to reduce the histamine levels? Have you tried allergy shots? It sounds like you are dealing with real bad leaky gut. One thing my naturopath stated about the reactions you have is that you are getting better not getting worse. Your body has become pretty clean and so anything can upset it. Its normal to react to sugar, alcohol, etc. What kinds of homeopathics have you tried? What manufacturers? -raster"

I was tested months ago with muscle testing and it came out negative – but going to give it another go with hair analysis. Amanda I’m glad to hear you’re looking into the hair test. I should tell you that when/if you get your results back you can’t just look at the levels of mercury being excreted in your hair in order to diagnose mercury toxicity. Often those with the most severe mercury toxicity (like autistic children) show very low levels of mercury on their hair test yet they remain highly toxic. The reason for this is that their body is so overwhelmed that they can’t excrete hardly any mercury at all. Because of this one has to look for deranged mineral transport which only occurs in mercury toxic or pregnant/lactating women. A hair test can be used to look for deranged mineral transport fortunately, via the use of the counting rules which Andy Cutler developed. His second book Hair Test Interpretation explains how the counting rules works, but they are also explained online. Here’s a link which explains them thoroughly: http://home.earthlink.net/~moriam/HOW_TO_hair_test.html You also might want to check out this website as it’s another valuable resource: http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/chelationnetwork/chelation-the-andy-cutler-protocol/"
0,rambolincoln,145,"For the past six months I’ve been having a constant sinus infection. After finally figuring out that my issue was with candida I begun putting a drop or two of Orageno Oil into my nasal rinse, which would stop the fungus dead in its tracks and make me feel a ton better. One or two days later the familiar facial, eye, and head pressures would come back again, though, and I was forced to do an Orageno Oil rinse daily to keep it away, sometimes twice a day. However, after learning that Orageno Oil can damage the mucous membranes, I found another solution. I poured a capsule of probiotic into my nasal rinse and took it after doing an Oregano flush. The next day I was feeling a lot better, but still felt some pressure, and continued to do the probiotic rinse for 5 days. For the next couple of weeks following the pressure and pain has been completely gone. Had I used Orageno alone, the pressure would have come back within a day or two. I was cured. For me it has been empirical evidence that probiotics are effective candida fighters. I used Bacillus Coagulans by Thorne Research, but I’m sure others would work. I believe many species have the tools to displace and fight off candida. If it works for the gut, why not the sinuses?"

The immune dysfunction causes the production of prostaglandin E2 to be increased in the body, and prostaglandin E2 inhibits the body’s normal immune response to Candida.

2,Lauren,146,"John, You can do this!! It might seem hard but it something that anyone can do. I know you can because I have. Take one step at a time. I love food and I love sweets! I come from Italian family that eats wonderful food that I can no longer eat. But I still can eat good food. It better for me and it is the only way I will get better. There are great recipes out there, check out the recipes on the forum. Whenever you think about eating something that you should not have, think about all the months it will put you back on getting better. Think of all the extra time you might have living a great life if you dont eat that thing. The hardest time for me personally is going to family events where great food is there and you can eat it. If you have a fantastic family like I do they will have choices that you can have. When I go to other family events that this is not the case I usually bring my own dish that I can eat (such as a egg casserole dish)or eat before and snack on a salad while they are eating. Hope this helps, Lauren"

I am hoping that both you and I stick with it and can start reintroducing foods one day; until then, know you are not alone, and that many of us find the initial process really sucky, too.

0,BeccaJR,147,"It is my goal to not make this too long, hopefully all works out to favor any eye strain. First and foremost my name is Becca and I have been sick for almost 10 years now. I am 21. My symptoms started out as being “typical” youth issues: depression, anxiety, eating disorder. It wasn’t until I was 18 and had begged doctors for years to listen to me and figure out why I had such severe issues, I was diagnosed with Celiacs disease and all of those issues dissipated. What hadn’t dissipated was extreme lethargy, fainting spells, constant dizziness, brain fog, irritability, lack of proper bowel function, hypotension (low blood pressure), anemia, random loss of co-ordination, headaches, the list goes on. I had been dealing with these issues believing what the doctor had told me, it may take up to 2 years for my body to normalize after beginning a gluten free diet. It had been 3 years, and although I had been feeling better, previously mentioned issues would come and go, except for lethargy which is always present. It’s a very one sided relationship that I’ve tried to end numerous times. So last April 2013 (exam time) things got brutal. Brain fog was the worst I have ever experienced (I would forget my name, age, slip on words); lethargy was as bad as when I had mono (couldn’t stay up for longer than 2 hours at a time); and my co-ordination got really bad. By August 2013 I lost the ability to walk and my doctors thought I either had MS or lupus. Everything came back negative, and as great as that was, coming back empty handed was quite gut-wrenching as the doctors told me to consider seeing a psychiatrist. Things have gotten better. Before a few days ago I was following the GAPS diet, however was unable to do the introductory diet. I am very picky about food, make everything myself, hardly ever eat pre-made foods. I also drink a lot of water and do at home enemas(I make sure everything is pure and sterilized). These changes helped greatly, but I find when I take 3 steps forward, a week later I take 2 steps back. My goal is to stop that trend and only progress. So, last Saturday I cut out all sugars after reading more about Candida and thought even if it wasn’t Candida it would be beneficial in a fight against parasites and pathogenic bacteria which I very well think I may have along with leaky gut. Heavy metal toxicity is another suspect on this game of diagnosis which I believe is a huge issue considering every time I take a chelator (chia seeds, flax seeds, chlorella) my symptoms are worsened. Adrenal fatigue has been confirmed. Funny how the symptoms all overlap one another? I have also been slowly prepping myself for a detox since mid-January 2014 by working on my digestive system and toning my liver. Taking natural anti-fungals like garlic and ginger have been a regular part of my routine for months now. So one question is, I cannot find this highly recommended diet by raster? I tried the search, but goodness, there are so many posts, even the exact phrase search came up with 73 pages worth of information. As well, how are you all doing with things? Any helpful tips would be really appreciated. Thank you to all who read this, and have helped not only me but others. Best wishes to everyone in overcoming this."
1,Vegan Catlady,147,"Hi Becca I have only been treating my candida since January, but already I feel like I have turned a corner. I remember in January I thought that day would never come. Alot of your symptoms do sound like adrenal exhaustion. Most people have it to some degree, and most candida-sufferers have it really bad. Since I have been treating mine, I have seen a big improvement in symptoms. I just popped-in to say it sounds like more than candida going on. Detoxing is a great idea, but since you have so much going on, my advice is to go a gentle route, otherwise you risk your adrenal exhaustion getting alot worse. Here is the famous raster’s safe food list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx 🙂"
0,pakalla,148,"Hi all. Just thought I would share this. If you miss fruit flavors in your life, try brewing some flavored herbal teas and mixing stevia into it. Brew them strongly and drink hot or chilled! Delicious and cuts flavor cravings. Hope this is useful to someone! Kim"
0,moldhater23,149,"I just picked a bottle of this up, anyone use it before? Anything to expect or side affects? I was pressing garlic cloves into water, but then my breath was unbearable, and not doing it on a regular basis so I wanted to switch to a tablet."
1,Keto42,149,"I’m using it now. Strong side effects for me. It says to take 2, but I’ve upped to 3 with each meal. 30-60 minutes later my joints start to crack and pop, which is the die off toxins in full effect. Within 2 days of continuous use I get migraines.. But having discovered Molybdenum amino acid chelate, it removes the acetaldehyde poisoning from Candida. My joints stop popping, no pain in my feet, no migraine/headache. I started with 250mcg, but switched to 500mcg about 60 minutes after each antifungal dose (or when I recognize die off symptoms). I also use N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC) to protect from acetaldehyde poisoning. (The same toxin from alcohol poisoning, aka the hangover side effects)"
2,moldhater23,149,I’m only take 2 2x a day with a meal. I’ve been on the Molybdenum amino acid chelate for about a month now so maybe that’s why i’m not feeling any side effects. Maybe I’ll up my dosage some. I’m about ten weeks into the diet and 2 weeks symptom free!
0,rob321,150,"Hi all, I got bad oral thrush 2 months ago and through natural remedies it had cleared up a lot but I have recently started a large dose of nyastin despite its sugar content to try and rid my symptoms fully. I am making progress mixing this with many natural treatments like coconut oil and collodial silver. I was curious to try a sort of spit test even though I’m sure there not exactly accurate. This morning I spit into 6 shot glasses, one with just warm water, one with Apple cider vinegar and warm water, one with baking soda and warm water, one with xylitol and warm water, one with brown sugar and warm water and one with nyastin oral suspension and warm water. No 1 (the control) had thin trails from surface to bottom. Apple cider vinegar it seems like it died and is only floating on top, no trails, baking soda had tiny trails from top, coconut oil almost discintigrated all spit with only a little sediment at the bottom, xylitol had big trail from top to bottom, brown sugar smaller trail comparably and nyastin had little clouds through out and was hard to see properly but there ya go apple cider vinegar and coconut oil definitely eliminated it!"
1,Vegan Catlady,150,"I decided to look more into cider vinegar,even though many have said you cannot place importance on a spit test. The first thing that came to mind while reading this was that there are no studies that prove conclusively that apple cider vinegar has an antifungal role *in candida* .  I looked, I swear. If anyone has links to conclusive evidence,im all ears. What I did find however was that many diets out there (GAPS, body ecology,ect) use apple cider vinegar to break down biofilm.  Apple cider has different phenolic acids that allegedly break this down…. why is so hard to find the studies supporting this? Apparently its used on an empty stomach for kids with autism too,since candida issues are a common occurrence there. I guess im posting this in hopes that I may directed to something that will encourage its use. Its super cheap, and if effective, would eliminate the need for these bad tasting,yucky enzymes. Not sure what to say about the coconut oil, however. A part of me just wants to blame the fact that its in oil form, that the spit gets bound by the oil. I use it and love it, but im not getting any die-off from it or anything, so im not sure how far its effect reaches."
2,rob321,150,"Well the coconut oil (pulling method) gave me the best results in getting my thrush which was really bad to this stage where it’s almost gone so I am a big believer in coconut oil, I usually hold and swish it for 15 mins 3 times a day if I can, and I do the same with collodial silver and kiefer now, I am trying same method with apple cider vinegar and will report back with any results, it’s a very curious and hidden world when it comes to candida healing so I figure most things are worth a try!"

Just be very careful with the ACV! It will dissolve your teeth. Im all about the coconut, although im personally at a stand-still with it. Looking forward to reading more 🙂 I think its important to journal, even if what you do seems unimportant at the time. Im journaling what I try on my thread, incase i do something that can help someone else."
4,Keto42,150,"I’ve used ACV for a long time for Candida but it didn’t work by itself. It’s also great for removing external yeast infections and has been used for hundreds of years for that purpose. So it’s no surprise it would have an effect on internal yeast overgrowth. The trick though is in using Organic ACV, w/the Mother. Filtered will just be high acidity with no enzymes, taking out everything that fights Candida, and replacing it with fermented goodness that Candida will love. I used Braggs brand of Organic Apple Cider Vinegar w/The Mother. It works well. I recently switched to another cheap generic brand because I couldn’t make the trip out to the grocery store that carried the Braggs brand. I quickly noticed I LOVED the taste of the cheap brand.. which was the first warning sign. I was having no die off symptoms and no change at all, so I realized the cheap brand was not organic or lacked the enzymes required. I found the Braggs brand in “upscale” grocery stores. I use at least 2 TB. diluted in about a quart of water, taken 3-5 times daily."
0,RachelY,151,"I just want to advise caution with regard to drinking Kefir as a probiotic, if you still have candida in your system. I had successfully followed a sugar, wheat, gluten and yeast-free diet for over a month (basically eating green veg, some meat and brown rice/quinoa – not easy as everyone knows). I had experienced quite severe die off, but was begining to see some real improvement in my symptoms and allergies and general energy levels/well being. I decided, on the basis of advice given on this website, to add kefir to my diet as a natural probiotic. I bought a starter kit and drank a small glass 3 days in a row. My symptoms all started to get worse and I felt pretty bad. Note, I did not change anything else in my very strict routine/diet. I immediately stopped the kefir and am back on track. It’s heart-breaking to have this happen after so much effort following the diet. Luckily I seem to have bounced back without too much of a negative effect on my health. Please think twice before using kefir – at least until you feel that you are fully clear of candida."
1,jameskep,151,"Also mention that kefir like vinegar is a high histamine food. So some people might have a sensitivity to kefir and think their experiencing die-off like symptoms with kefir when they could be actually experiencing a histamine overload. http://www.foodsmatter.com/allergy_intolerance/histamine/articles/histamine.html “6. Avoid fermented foods such as cheese, wine, vinegar, fermented sausages, soy sauce and sauerkraut as these naturally contain high levels of histamine.”"

1,Tdog333,152,One of the supplements I took was ellagic acid. I think it helped out. Its only like 5 bucks and ellagic acid is naturally found in berries. Ellagic acid is a strong chitin inhibitor
2,Vegan Catlady,152,"I have looked in a few places for ellagic acid supplements…couldnt find them. I would definitely pursue that if I could find it. AND… another forum member here testified that he believed strawberries helped cure him. He held strawberries on the tongue to remove thrush,too. Interesting thread he had. Nutritionfacts.org did a short 2 min video on strawberries curing esophageal cancer I believe, there might be a connection there if candida was a precursor or a symptom."

Is water kefir going to be any helpful since i cannot have milk kefir."
2,raster,153,"Well its pretty clear you have a toxicity problem. The toxins first affected your lungs (hence the respiratory problems) and then the toxins affected your skin. Your body detoxes via 3 basic methods, via the bowels, via the skin, and via the lungs. For some reason your body broke down and is no longer detoxing via the liver and thus it has to detox via other methods such as skin and lungs. So in order to heal yourself you need to detox the toxins. You can do this by taking specific liver supplements and homeopathics, or you can detox naturally by sweating out the toxins by doing a steam room, sauna, hot tub, jacuzzi, etc. I also shared a post recently about other detox methods: http://drlwilson.com/detox_protocols.htm Here is a different post where I talked about detoxing and you can find more and more of them on the forum if you did a search: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst8053_Die-Off-remedies—-Able-I-would-appreciate-your-advice-please.aspx The dandruff could be related to yeast, but it also could be related to parasites. No need to worry, you won’t be able to kill off all of the yeast or parasites but only reduce their numbers. Skin conditions could be related to deficiencies in HCL (hydro-chloric acid) per Dr. Mcoombs and if you supplement yourself with HCl you likely would notice an improvement in your skin. Antifungals alone won’t cure your infestation; all they do is kill the candida. This shouldn’t be your only goal. You need to change the environment within your gut internally in order to get better. Probiotics and prebiotics can do this. It also appears you are going the western medicine route. This is unfortunate because as you can see all they do is throw antibiotics and medication at the symptoms. They don’t treat the cause of the symptoms and they don’t treat gut flora disorders. And the symptoms don’t completely dissappear either… You’ll need an immune system in order to get better and it’ll be hard to get your’s back in check quickly. This takes years of work. I am not the best person to ask about how to boost the immune system. I shared some products by standard process recently such as congaplex which boosts the immune system. It also sounds like you may have a deficiency in minerals because your body needs the minerals to fight candida. So I would supplement with minerals and consider eating meat which contains minerals as well. You also need to reduce the inflammation of the gut in order to get better and heal leaky gut. As you can see you need a multi-faceted holistic approach and will need to spend a bunch of money on supplements. A good naturopath can heal you, but it costs money. Check our super silica (for hair), its $50 per bottle. Check out SF722 its $30 per bottle (best antifungal). Fermented cod liver oil is $45 per bottle (reduces inflammation). HMF neuro is $40 per bottle (best probiotic). And I can list more and more stuff that can help you but it costs money. And this stuff might not be the most effective for treating your ailments… Check out the product lines of standard process, integrative thereaputics, thorne, pure encapsulations, harmonic interprizes, seroyal, etc. These are the products that heal the body and are what are used by naturopaths. -raster"
3,hopefrbest,153,"firstly i can’t thank you enough for your reply. i know my body is really messed up and it literally has been abused by the use of antibiotics over the years and the anti acne regime i followed for a month(i hate myself for that stupid decision). i literally have tears in my eyes because i was a kid then and didn’t really knew what was right or wrong i have just turned 20. when you get ill you go to the doc.that’s the norm.that’s what i did,n i followed the prescribed medication. how on earth would a 14 year old know about antibiotics n their side effects, i think i cannot be blamed for that atleast. i continued using them because i got relief ,though i complained to the doc that why do i have to come back repeatedy,he said it was due to dust,pollution in the air. anyways i know allopathy isn’t a true and complete solution,and i completely agree with what you said.a year back i decided to follow a new path(that’s when i started to lose hair and the dermatologist prescribed me anti fungal shampoo,creams, n advised me to use minioxdil).i refused the latter at the very moment.i used the shampoos n i have literally cried after looking at the state of my hair. you misunderstood me, I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO FAITH LEFT IN (WESTERN) ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION(atleast for the past year or so). i am currently seeing a Ayurveda doctor(he is healing me holistically,through natural herbs n treatment). funny thing is that he too said the same thing that you said that it will take a long time and a lot of effort to get better.he too is focusing on the immune system(which he says is very very weak). n i think i am much better than what i was a year ago. i would say the symptoms have reduced by 25-30%.it has been 4 months only. at first , i thought i had dandruff n all the problms due to dairy,yeast intolerance,eggs. what do you think about that?is it because of candida? do i even have candida, i want to test for it,since tests aren’t that expensive here.i am also thinking of taking a basic body test that will look into my liver,kidneys,blood etc. i think that one wouldn’t cost me less than $50. how do i get to know which mineral/vitamin i am deficient in?  i did the iron test(S.FERRITIN) lst year the value was 36,the range was 28-300.but the doc said it was fine. the main problem was i live in india, not u.s.a i don’t think the brands you mentioned will deliver here though i will check it. please read the second post again n tell me about the probiotics. i can ask help for money from my mom,but atleast the product should be available n feasible(mega flora would cost me $ 100 for 60 cap.) i can’t afford that. n about kefir as well, water/milk? which one? will the water one be equally effective? i am ready to fight this, i know it may take a few years to heal myself competely but with the help of others who can guide n advice me in this process, i think it would make this horrific stage of my life somewhat better. many thanks"
4,healinglight,153,"I know how difficult it is to follow the candida healing plan in India. It took me about 11 months research, finances management, and sources to provide me with all supplements and probiotics I needed on the plan…and am still going on without some that I cannot find here. And even if things are available, they are way too expensive in Indian rupees. I can think of a few things that may help you in low budget. I went through the probiotics links you’ve sent, but they have too low potency. Is it possible for you to ask someone to send you your stock of probiotics like I did? Purchasing it in the US was less expensive, than what it was with the shipment (if at all I found some company shipping it). I have already given you a list of supplements I have been taking in a PM, I understand that you feel the list is too long, but I feel my body had so many mineral and vitamin deficiencies because of candida that I feel the list is great (reading more on the forum about why we need it might give you an insight why it is recommended)! I would like to add that accupressure and detoxification methods like steam, dry brushing, oil pulling are great. I am taking regular Neem water enemas (and sometimes retained enemas) and it really helps me. I have a self enema kit to do so, which is not very expensive. Also there is a yogic kriya Laghu Shankh Prakshalan that helped me. You may find details on internet searching or else you may ask me about it. For ENT issues I take Steam (add carom seeds/ajwain and turmeric powder while boiling water), do salt water Neti and gargle. Oil pulling is great with either coconut oil or sesame oil. I also have a simple handy book on accupressure and color therapy and do that on my own because I had some prior idea about it. Also, you may do simple deep breathing, nadi shodhan, kapal bhati, bhastrika and bhramri pranayamas to detoxify the body. But just remember to start with a very low count, and slowly. Gradually you may increase the number, and speed. Personally, I would not like to see any specialist right now who would not know about candida, and I’d rather follow the forum. Sometimes, if ayurvedic medicines are prepared by the practitioner he may add honey or raisins or anything else sweet to it, so please make sure you are taking Ayurvedic medicines free from sugar. Also, I know that topical use of coconut oil and camphor really help resolve even long term skin issues, but am not sure in your case, may be you can read more about it or read over the internet. All the best."
5,hopefrbest,153,"thanks for replying. i really appreciate it. sadly,i don’t know anyone who could ship me the probiotics otherwise i would have given it a try at least. i am a person who believes that the food should provide for all the essential nutrients ,etc.i would like to test first for any nutritional and mineral deficiencies before taking any supplements of an sorts.any test that could cover all the aspects? if anything comes up i would definitely be ready to start taking any supplements. i have heard that enemas help but i get too scared to do it. i wouldn’t be able to do it myself,i know that. my ENT system is much better now. for the past few months it hasn’t been a major problem. chewing a clove works for me though i would try the steam therapy next time . i will search about all the yoga exercises and start doing them for a few minutes. i myself don’t want to consult an allopathic doctor. their way of treating is pathetic.symptoms are relieved which come back after stopping the medication. a nutritionist i would like to consult,just to have better knowledge on food.maybe even better diet plans and other stuff . you were right about sugar in ayurvedic medicine, one of the syrup contains raisins(approx. 20%)though the other tablets and powder seem to be fine. i couldn’t find honey listed as ingredients. i will ask about them on my next visit and probably would also ask to stop the sugar containing solution or atleast prescribe me one which would have the least amount of sugar.i want to continue my treatment with them as i feel much better even if their medicines contain any form of sweet ingredients. i don’t know what is working for me so i wouldn’t risk stop doing anything that i have been doing for the past three months .moreover,the diet of both are more or less same(with ayurvedic one being lenient with wheat,sugar) i also will inquire about enema from them. again, thanks for your help."

7,healinglight,153,"I too believe in taking nutrients through natural sources, but here we must understand that candida has robbed our body of nutrients to an extent it is very difficult to meet with just natural sources. You may take herbs, like you mentioned Amla (Indian Gooseberry) in your other post, if you wish to avoid supplements, though it may be a good idea to prepare a list of the supplements you are not apprehensive about taking, prepare a budget and go ahead with it. I would switch to the forum’s strict diet. I am highly in favor of it. It is tough to follow, but it works. Have you read the forum’s posts in the link below? http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst4622_Useful-Links-and-Forum-Posts.aspx This might be helpful to you as it was for me. As far as I know,FOS are very much allowed on the diet. I have no clue about pets being around (I have none), but why don’t you search in the forum’s posts? I guess mold is the real culprit, but for some people even if there is moisture and seepage there may be breathing issues and body ache and so on. Yeah, starting with whatsoever is available is a good idea. I thought of doing that too had I not found someone who was ready to help me with this."
8,ProbioticsEtc,153,"I can see there are a lot of experts here who seem very knowledgeable. Obviously I am quite late to this topic and forum.

0,saurusboy,154,"I’ve been suffering from a weird fungus that grows incessantly on my scalp, under my eyebrows, in my nose, all throughout my mouth and on my lips. It’s been a nightmare (seemed like a mix of seborrheic dermatitis and cadida). I don’t want to make this super long and I’m also not sure if others have posted about this, but after I drank this homemade mixture, the white fungus on my lips dried up and came off and the fungus on my tongue scraped off easily with a tongue scraper (this all happened within a half hour after drinking it). The fungus on my scalp doesn’t grow as quickly and it’s been a miracle for me. Knock on wood. 1 tablespoon of baking soda 1 tablespoon of maple syrup (I used Aunt Jamima) Mix both thoroughly in a small glass of water Drink it That’s it. I felt like I had a duty to post this info because I would have given my world to know about it years ago. It works best on an empty stomach but I do it maybe twice a day, sometimes after I’ve eaten food and it still works well. They say the concoction is being used to treat cancer? And they say cancer is a fungus so it makes sense why it’s been dying off for me. Apparently the syrup absorbs the baking soda and gets it in your system better than drinking the baking soda alone. I don’t know the logistics, all I know is it works for me. I’d been washing my hair with baking soda, apple cidar vinegar, you name it, and the results weren’t great. But I finally realized you need to start with inside your body and annihilate the root of the fungus. Lemme know if you have any questions!"

This post has to be a joke.And they say cancer is a fungus so it makes sense why it’s been dying off for me. Can you tell us who “they” are? Is this a scientist who happens to live next door? First of all, cancer can be caused by many different factors but none of them are called “fungi.” Basically, cancer first occurs when a normal body cell mutates and then multiplies; eventually the mutated cells begin to grow out of control causing tumors, etc. In addition, cancer cells contain membranes and fungi cells do not, so we’re talking about two entirely different things here.

4,lockie86,154,"Thanks Sean. So you really don’t think that cancer can be caused by candida being loose in the bloostream? That’s really reassuring if so! :-)) I’ve seen websites like this one http://candidacleanser.com/ which claim that candida loose in the bloodstream leads directly to ‘most cancers’! Here’s what they say: 1. First the Candida fungi roots itself in the deep connective tissue (in the various organs.) 2. The fungus then expands, the body responds by attempting to encyst the fungi colonies, with the outcome being the formation of neoplasias, basically a tumor forms around the fungus. 3. Growth both in the surrounding tissue and other areas of the body (metastasis). 4. Progressive exhaustion of the body with consequential total body invasion. This is obviously very alarming if true, but then the site does seem to be very unprofesssional, full of typos, and preying on everyone’s worse fears over cancer. And I know there are other schools of thought on here that say the symptoms of candida are due not to the candida itself travelling beyond the gut, but the many different toxins that the candida creates within the colon which then enter the bloodstream. So do you think candida itself gets into the bloodstream, or just the toxins it produces? I presumed that is you had a ‘leaky gut’ that the candida would be getting out into the bloodstream along with the food particles? Would be great to hear your thoughts on this. Those Candida Cleanser people do seem like scammers, but it’s hard not to worry at the same time! Many thanks, Mark, UK"

Just remember what “scientific standard” means.. @Able, aren’t you confusing eukaryotic cells such as fungi and human with prokaryotic cells, bacteria?

8,Vegan Catlady,154,"Wow, its really not that hard to find the dozens of articles on the connection between cancer and fungi. https://www.google.com/search?q=cancer+fungus+connection&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=sb For someone who hasnt been a researcher long and doesnt look for the references that the article writers use, the connection between cancer and fungus would appear huge and overwhelming. THE POINT (if anyone reads the articles) is not that you have candida and then it turns into cancer, but that candida can create acidosis if left untreated long enough, by the eliminatory glands and organs getting overwhelmed with toxins and the lymph becoming sluggish. Adding baking soda,alkalizing the body, is a well known path some people take. Cancer thrives in an acid environment (not to be confused with the acidic gut). Im not saying this is accurate, I am saying the possibilities are evident. I feel bad for the person who started this post- All I interpreted as a result was ” if we havent come to the same conclusion prior to you posting your experience,your dumb for having posted it”. At the risk of being thrown off this forum, the response here was cruel 🙁"
0,Vegan Catlady,155,"Okay, so my first week on the forum I bought a bunch of herbal and other to get a handle on the candida. One of things I got was Candidase (cellulase and protease) I read somewhere here that this isnt helpful, and only took one dose. Upon further reading , there are posts that say its okay and works on biofilms. All it is, is cellulase and protease. Since I am at a point where I am okay with some sugars/carbs in minute amounts (like occasional beans or toast) I am not especially concerned with the convert of fiber to sugar, since I believe I read it doesnt happen in large amounts AND you cant really starve candida anyway since it can adapt to eat all kinds of things. Any strong opinions? Since probiotics disagree with me, I have to try something else."
1,Vegan Catlady,155,"Spent hour reading nothing but reviews, this doesnt make sense if you are trying to repopulate the gut with good bacteria. If it breaks down the fiber that good bacteria need to ferment and bloom, then it its self-defeating,no?"
2,fireman22,155,"I’ve been using virastop + candidase on an empty stomach and also digestive enzymes with food. Pretty good results so far but I cleared up a lot of my candida(or whatever is wrong with me) with antifungals and the like before starting these. It’s only been a couple weeks since I started taking them but so far I like the results, hopefully it sticks when I’m through with the candidase and virastop. I will most likely just stick to probiotics and normal digestive enzymes for a bit afterwards."
3,Vegan Catlady,155,"Do you find it makes your tummy feel weird to take it? I was uncomfortable, it was gurgly and felt like it was foaming lol. Does that go away? or maybe the dose was a good dose for you and too much for me ? I hope you testify later on when your completely cleared up on your protocol 🙂"
4,fireman22,155,"I don’t recall feeling too uncomfortable when I started candidase. I only started using 1 pill instead of 2 at a time and worked my way up. I was always bloated and using enzymes seemed to work the best for that. Maybe you should try sticking with it a bit longer and see if gurgly/uncomfortable feeling goes away. Remember to take at least 2 hours after or an hour before a meal. I’m not using any antifungals besides this, enzymes and probiotics so maybe those are having an effect on it? I don’t take any supplements within that time frame either and try to let the candidase + virastop do their job."

I think it’s just too much for your system to handle especially since we are treating ourselves for months and months. At least it seems that way for me. It’s been a real slow battle for me but I am definitely feeling better. When I first tried probiotics I didn’t feel any difference. After I felt a little better with using antifungals I tried probiotics again and finally noticed a positive effect, so I keep on trying out new things. I just try to make sure I’m not using too many things at once so I’ll swap stuff out. Hope you get better it’s hard to learn this stuff on your own!"

I’m 27 and for 3 years have suffered from what I’m being told is lichen planus and another unknown rash. In also have several other symptoms such as constipation, chronic migraine, sinus issues, and on and on. I purchased a product called Now Candida Support but have not started taking it. I just read that products like this are not good because they cause resistance. My real question is what would you all suggest I use as I’ve never done this before and am pretty overwhelmed with all the conflicting info. Thanks so much!"
1,Amanda_Grace,157,"I recently put two and two together also. I scoured all over this site and have been making the suggested recipes. I searched other sites, but this one is my favorite. I am going to buy the book so I know exactly what to do, and I like that it comes with a cookbook too. I can tell you that as soon as I cut out sugar, my symptoms dramatically decreased. Also, I make the recipes without any sugar or substitutes. I read about stevia and xylitol and am not sure I am okay with the possible side effects, so fyi. The most important thing I’ve learned is that rutabaga is awesome, but do not eat a lot of it at once!!! LOL, it will give you a stomach ache if you do! As far as the conflicting info, I did see that too. I decided that if something was said to be okay on one site, but not okay on another, I avoided it. Once I feel my symptoms are totally under control, I can re-introduce those foods and see if there is a reaction. If there is not, then it is okay to eat. Honestly, I really didn’t feel the other sites I looked at were as good as this one though, so this is what I’m using as my main guide. About your new pills, I would research the ingredients and see what you find. I would think that they probably wouldn’t hurt, but with the symptoms you’re having you really need to adjust your diet. After all, it’s the sugar that the yeast need to survive and as long as you are providing them with that, you are going to keep having symptoms until you get it under control."

I definitely notice that I have cravings for sweets immediately when I quit smoking, also that when I quit smoking I get incredibly gassy and it smells super bad. Directly related somehow- as I have attempted to quit several times always with the same immediate side effects. I don’t notice that it is a consistency for all people who quit smoking, but I’ve been following a lot of my symptoms to the Candida category. Kombucha makes a great probiotic drink called gingerade.

The patch contains a variety of chemicals in it…the chemicals are so potent that some kids take the patch, open it up, and smoke it. This can kill you and is dangerous. The first week is the worst and the cravings should last about 3 weeks or so and then it will gradually decrease to no cravings within 6 weeks. I used the cravings to fuel my motivation to quit because isn’t fun. I recommend consuming fruit while getting over it…to help with blood sugar. For me, low blood sugar was a trigger. -raster"

I read somewhere on the internet that every year you suffer candida it will take that many months to recover from it, I don’t know whether that’s true or not.

I’m continuing to take 4Billion CFU twice daily but I notice that my bloating, gas, and respiratory problems are still the same, maybe a little better but. Could it be that my Candida is already under control and my Probiotics are just causing excess bloating and gas that’s unnecessary? I stopped taking my probiotics for two days and my bloating,gas, and respiratory symptoms resided alot, but my forehead started to break out ALOT. I’ve had previous die-off last month with skin rashes, acne, fatigue, and sore muscles and joints, I also did have to urinate ALOT (around three or four times every hour) but this month it’s been consistent gas, bloating, and minor respiratory problems, but I do have regular bowel movement. Is there any possible way to tell that this isn’t die-off? As of right now I’ve lowered my probiotic dosage to one 4billion CFU capsule perday, still experiencing minor bloating and gas.

I’m a beginner in all this and so far I haven’t had much time to study it all."

Chlorella and cilantro can be extremely dangerous to those with mercury toxicity and I would argue against their use. I want to say again… they can mess you up big time if you have a mercury toxicity issue. The reason they are so dangerous is because the half-life of a chelating agent is extremely important and the half-life of both of these substances is unknown. See whenever you chelate, you want to keep a steady level of whatever chelating agent you are using in your bloodstream. If the level of the chelating agent within your bloodstream is at a certain level and then drops below that level those mercury ions that were once attached to the chelators are now being dropped and then redistributed around the body. This causes unpleasant symptoms, oxidative stress, and other damaging health effects to the body. The goal of a chelation protocol should be to maximize mercury removal and minimize the redistribution just described. If you suspect mercury toxicity I highly recommend you check out Andy Cutler’s book(s) Amalgam Illness: Diagnosis and Treatment and Hair Test Interpretation: Finding Hidden Toxicities. Both are full of information and should be read by anyone suffering from mercury toxicity. There’s a Yahoo Group dedicated to those recovering with his protocol and I wanted to leave you with a post from there regarding the use of cilantro/chlorella to detox mercury. Hopefully this scares you enough to avoid using cilantro/chlorella for detox: Cilantro nearly killed me, and many other members have gotten horribly worse from it. I really hope you are OK with the improper protocol, but to put it bluntly, you are playing with fire. I don’t know about you but I wouldn’t want to play russian roulette with my health. I’m not kidding when I tell you that improper chelation can CRIPPLE you to the point of suicide, severe depression, severe loss of well being, psychosis, etc. Not everyone gets horribly worse but if you do the research you’ll see LOTS of people got horribly and often permanently worse from improper chelation. I’m talking like 10 years to get back to somewhat normal. No, this is not your typical case, but neither is getting mercury toxicity from amalgam fillings. Most people with them are fine. A lot of people who chelate improperly are also fine, some get sicker and others lose it all and get really, really messed up. BTW, chlorella cannot chelate anything if you look at the chemical makeup it is a “sulfury” food with a single thiol. It’s often also contaminated with heavy metals. The only thing that has helped me recover from my improper chelation has been ALA in low frequent doses per Andy’s protocol. As I said, don’t take this personal because I am only here trying to help you and other members. I took cilantro and chlorella for a few days and it screwed me up big time. Severe yeast overgrowth, my liver stopped clearing toxins, I got severe neurological problems, could barely get out of bed, etc. I’d say it added at least 4 or 5 years to my chelation journey. Is that really something you want to risk over a few capsules of Chelex?"
5,Blue Poppy,160,"Thank you, ThomasJoel2 And I ordered two bottles 🙁 So, is ALA ok?"
6,ThomasJoel2,160,"Blue Poppy;54323 wrote: So, is ALA ok? It depends on how you use it. 😉 First off, do you have dental amalgams in your mouth? If so, don’t attempt chelation until you get all amalgams safely removed. If you chelate with amalgams in you will get much more sick. Second, after amalgam removal you must wait at least 3 months before using any ALA to chelate. Third, when chelating with ALA or any other chelating agent like DMSA or DMPS you must chelate according to the half-life of the substance. If you were to take ALA every other day or once a day you’re running the huge chance of making yourself MUCH worse as a result. The dosing method is extremely critical. Don’t rush into anything yet.

How do you suggest I dose ala? Check out that link I posted and read through that page in its entirety. It will answer your question for how to dose ALA. Despite the fact that you have had your amalgams removed you will want to make sure via x-ray that you have absolutely no remaining fragments. If you have any root canals, crowns, or dentures you will also want them taken care of before you take any chelating agent. Attempting chelation with any remaining mercury in your mouth is a guaranteed way to make yourself worse instead of better. Sorry if I’m beating a dead horse here, but I really want to hammer that point home. Here’s a page that details how to go about dental revision: http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/drclarknetwork/dr-clarks-clean-ups/dental-clean-up/ I’m incredibly lucky in that I’ve never had any dental work done; my sources of mercury exposure are limited to vaccines and a high-fish diet. Because of this I don’t have the personal experience to draw upon to warn you of everything that you need to look out for when it comes to dental revision; I can only point you in the right direction.

Are this things chelating in any dose? Cilantro is a true chelator in the sense that it is a double-thiol compound that crosses the blood brain barrier, meaning that it can remove mercury from the brain. Despite this, its half-life and method of action are unknown, so it’s impossible to know how often one would need to take it in order to keep your blood levels at a steady level. Without a steady level of chelators in your bloodstream you would constantly be dropping off mercury within your bloodstream which would then get later redistrubted somewhere around your body. This can cause lots of damage and is the reason why any proper chelation protocol should be aimed at minimizing redistribution and maximizing excretion. There’s no doubt you would get much worse in the long-term if you were to start eating cilantro. How you would immediately react would depend on how poisoned you are and how your symptoms manifest due to your individual biochemistry. You’d probably respond, at the very least, with strong fatigue, emotional disturbances, anxiety, etc. Chlorella is not a actually a chelator because it is only a single-thiol compound. This means that it will pick up mercury ions and move them around in your body without excreting hardly any mercury. This causes oxidative damage in your body and would cause the same symptoms that you would experience from taking cilantro."
0,Thomas,161,"Hi Able, I felt very good now for about 4 days. My symptoms where nearly gone, I had only very very little symptoms in the stomach. But suddenly I was hit again with a Panic attack. This came after I had one capsule Probiotic on a empty stomach today in the morning. Searching the net I found interesting information I would like to ask you about and hope you can bring light on as I don’t understand it fully. what does that mean? Other studies have highlighted the fact that abnormally distributed gut bacteria profile cause IBS. The medical condition whereby the gut bacteria species are abnormally distributed is a condition called Intestinal Dysbiosis.’ http://www.ibs-irritable-bowel-syndrome.com.au/IBS_intestinal_dysbiosis.htm A healthy gastrointestinal tract is one that has a particular set of bacteria living within it. Normally it is difficult to change the number and type of these healthy bacteria and they are remarkably stable over many different populations around the world, even though we live in different environments and eat different diets. It is becoming widely recognised that alterations in these bacteria population and count can adversely influence our health. This is because bacteria in our digestive tract produce many vitamins, micronutrients and chemicals that maintain the health of our bodies. When these bacteria are not normally distributed, chemicals that are detrimental to our health might be produced in larger amounts and can cause dysfunction. That is why so many bacterial supplements (probiotics) have become available. For example probiotics containing Lactobacillus acidophillus and Bifidobacterium are common and their health benefits are greatly touted. Unfortunately it is not as simple as talking probiotics. Often these common bacteria are overgrown in the gut resulting in increased amine production, which in turn causes cognitive and attention deficits, depression and tiredness. Yesterday I had for the first time a little organic chicken. I felt great and didnt have any reactions. In the morning when I woke up I had a warm glass of water with a half lime and one capsule of Probiotic. I felt all in all great. Then I 30 to 45 min later I went to the compute to read our forum and …wham it hit me…. cold/ warm sweat, dizziness, heart palpations, cold hands, shivering in the muscles, panic attack starting to take over. Then I drank glass of water, talked to my wife to calm myself, and slowly the worst goes down again but I am still shaken. What does it mean in the text: abnormally distributed gut bacteria creates problems. Did I do this by taking the Probiotics? I felt so good since I started to to take the Probiotic and now I got a chock after this attack out of the blue. Can you help me out? thanks Thomas"

0,SickofCandida,162,"Hello all, I am new to strict dieting. I have tried to cut out refined carbs with little success, but I am so sick of it now, I’m going hardcore warfare. I have had little to no carbs for the past two days (I’m basically eating nothing but chicken/beef, bell peppers, onions, garlic, celery, eggs, and avocados), and also started diflucan (150mg every other day… but I decided to take it the first two days based on when I tried to get rid of this crap before… last year I went through two rounds of diflucan, and both round were daily dosing… still didn’t completely get rid of it… and then it just came back.) The no carbs, in addition to the extreme die off, is killing me. So I saw on the strict diet list that you can have some complex carbs – like oat bran and quinoa. Today (I’m on 3rd day), I went out and got some oat bran. I ate some for lunch and… I’m feeling itchy now. Not sure if it’s coincidence or what… but is it possible the oat bran did it? Also in the oat bran… I mixed in almond butter (made of pure ground almonds, nothing else), a couple spoonfuls of plain yogurt, and 1/8 teas stevia. I have had the yogurt before and it didn’t bother me. A confounding variable… In the middle of the night last night, I woke up with my belly feeling like it was on fire, pounding heart, and alternating between hot flashes and chills (I’m in my 20s… so it’s not menopause 🙂 ). I think it was due to the zero carb thing… so I panicked and had a small glass of milk to soothe my stomach and a couple (tiny) handfuls of cheerios. So… it could possibly be that, but the itchiness happened so close to the oat bran, and I had only a small amount of milk/cheerios, so….. I don’t know. I woke up this morning feeling so good, so I was somewhat relieved thinking that I hadn’t totally set myself back with the milk/cereal. Ugh. I hate this. Please let me know if any of you have trouble with oat bran, and if you do, let me know what you did about it. I need some carbs. I’ll note that I think I have leaky gut based on what I’m reading. I have a lot of food sensitivities, and I started having bizarre/random allergic reactions (eyes swelling shut) several months ago. They happen so frequently and randomly that I can’t pin point what’s causing it."
1,raster,162,"I don’t know what strict food list you are referring to but here is mine: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx The beef can set you back because it takes 1-2 days to digest whereas chicken/fish take hours to digest. The beef and pork can cause constipation. I don’t know where you read that you shouldn’t have carbs, but you need them to be healthy…the yeast feeds on everything strict diet or not. Oat bran does contain gluten so this is why you should be very careful with it as a food item. On my food list there is an asterisk next to it, which means it can cause problems. You need to learn about testing foods properly and what side effects to look for. As far as milk and cheerios, that shouldn’t be on the diet as you may know… For a great replacement for oat bran, I recommend cream of buckwheat which has a similar texture. -raster"
2,TheChosenOne,162,"Buckwheat is an excellent substitue for oat bran. But oat bran itself is also pretty safe. It doesn’t contain gluten by itself, but it is usually produced in a gluten environment. Even people who have coeliac can usually safely consume one cup a day. Bobs Red Mill Oat Bran doesn’t contain gluten. Whatever you do, just try it a little bit in the beginning and add more day by day."
3,SickofCandida,162,"Thanks so much for the replies! I was going off the strict diet list on the main website… and it lists oat bran. I did buy the gluten free (bob’s red mill). Thanks for the tip on beef. I try to mainly eat chicken… that’s the easiest anyway. And the list you provided was very helpful also. I’ll be trying to get my hands on some buckwheat flour… Stevia… I am reading that it potential affects hormones? I’m concerned because my symptoms are extremely sensitive to hormones, and I also have other conditions related to hormone levels. It seems like anything I do that might mess with them will mess with them…."
4,raster,162,"There are 3 forms of buckwheat; buckwheat flour used for baking, cream of buckwheat (bob’s red mill) which is like oatmeal (also can be used for baking), and buckwheat groats which is similar texture to quinoa/rice. For stevia, I recommend trying it out or atleast using it for special cheat items or dessert. I haven’t had any problems with it and its seen as generally safe from over 90% of the people I have seen on the forum (over the 2.5 years I have been on here). -raster"
5,SickofCandida,162,"Thanks Raster… every time I see a post from you and Able on this forum, I perk up. It is really nice to have people on here who take the time to do this. I do have another dilema now. I am losing hope because my husband and I are going to try to have a baby soon. I am going to finish the diflucan before then and probably get in about a week of herbs from my acupunturist that stimulate my immune system. I have chronic fatigue and those herbs have helped so much before (it is a capsule containing these: radix rehmanniae, cortex eucommiae, fructus corni, radix aconiti latera preparata, cortex cinnamomi, colla cornus cervi, rhizoma pinelliae). The first time I took this supplement, it caused some die off, so I think it will be good to do. I’ll also continue taking fish oil supplements and a prenatal vitamin, and probably some extra vitamin c, and probiotics. When we start trying to have the baby… that’s when I get cautious… and I will severely restrict what I put in my body in terms of supplements/extra vitamins. I am even nervous to do supplemental probiotics (I’m hoping kefir/yogurt will help). I am wanting to do a candida-conscious diet, but, obviously, I can’t be too restrictive while pregnant. Plus, what little will power I’ll have will probably be toast when I get those prego cravings (I’ll still do my best, but ugh… I just remember what it was like and it was so hard). Do you have any advice for someone who will probably be pregnant soon? I just recently had two back to back miscarriages (the drops in hormones both times made my yeast symptoms fairly severe)… so I think getting pregnant will happen quickly (hopefully), but… we’ll see if this one sticks. I think getting pregnant actually helps my symptoms, but I’m betting it’s because my immune system function drops… not because the yeast actually goes away. I could use some help with kidney/liver flushes too. I tried going on milk thistle before doing all this to prep my liver and I got a kidney infection, plus had some liver pain. Not sure if it flushed a bunch of junk out and clogged my kidneys or what, but milk thistle is out. Sorry to be so needy; I’m trying to hang in there, but I’m overwhelmed and then adding the trying to have another kid on top of that is throwing me for a loop."

0,TheChosenOne,165,"The intestinal tract is an ecosystem ruled by checks and balances. In a balanced system, pathogenic organisms are kept in check. Upset that balance and the pathogenic organisms can take over and play a role in determining the composition and function of this system. This relationship is exemplified between the Lactobacillus bacterial species and Candida albicans. Lactobacillus strains are known to inhibit candida through their overwhelming numbers and their production of acids, peroxidases, and hypothiocyanate. Taking antibiotics destroys the balance in this ecosystem allowing for pathogenic organisms like fungal Candida albicans to take root and grow unchecked. Once candida begins to increase in numbers, it plays a regulatory role and shapes the composition of the intestinal flora by increasing certain bacterial species, such as Enterrococcus strains, and inhibiting others, such as Lactobacillus species.

1,Vegan Catlady,165,"“In spite of companies marketing their probiotic formulas and fermented foods to the contrary, probiotics have not been found to be a successful way to treat systemic fungal infections. Once candida has established a strong fungal presence, probiotics alone are of little use. Researchers at the University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, Wisconsin, found no clear benefit in treating candida with probiotics alone. The overgrowth of the Enterrococcal strains can be another factor that prevents the re-establishment of pre-antibiotic flora.” In our home, we have been taking probiotics in both food/suppliments for years. I wouldnt have COS if probiotics were as aggressive as often touted."

0,BenHarris,168,"I would like to start by saying I am a 29 yr old male who has been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. After a serious bout of antibiotics about a year ago I started getting severe genital thrush infections. I used to get them from time to time and would just treat them with topical cream. After the Antibiotics it was so severe that I was taking 6 x 3000mg of Olive leaf extract everyday and cream every morning. After doing a whole heap of research I discovered about sugars and carbs being terrible for the growth of candida albicans. This is my story and what worked for me. It took 12 weeks. I was so sick of these infections I was considering circumcision. After much study I decided to give “The Candida Diet” a go. This is what I excluded from my diet. All fruits except tomatoe & lemon Sugar Honey Starchy Vegetables (Anything white other than Zuccini & Cucumber) Carbs: Rice, Bread, Pasta, Gluten Coffee & Caffeine This is what I Included: Green Vegetables & Bell Peppers (Capsicum) All Meats (I ate bacon although I know a lot of sources say not to eat bacon and I also ate Gluten & sugar free sausages) Coconut flour baked goods Mayonaise Eggs All Bran Cereal (Once or twice a week after a month on the diet) Stevia Diet Ginger Beer Copius amounts of Low sugar yoghurt (No fruit – you can beat in Stevia for sweetness) I do not do things by halves and 1stly I would like to stress that this is not a diet, but rather a way of life. I was so sick of my infections that I was willing to do anything. And that means not “Cheating” not having “Off days” not “Bending the rules” but making a decision to kill this thing. I jumped straight into the diet with no detox or cleansing diet. This worked but also made me feel like I was dying. Having fibromyalgia means that I am used to feeling sick, but this was like my body was full of poison. I drank plenty of water and toughed it out, feeling like I had been hit by a truck and like I was going to throw up I was determined to see this thing through. My “Die off period” lasted 2 days. I ate Bacon Sausages & eggs for breakfast. Omelets, scrambled, whatever combo i could come up with.  I ate Chicken salad for lunch. This was sometimes exchanged for Steak salad. I used Paul Newmans Creamy Ceaser Dressing. (Do not use diet version it has double the sugars and double the Carbs. For dinner I ate Fried cabbage with stevia sprinkled on it. I then would fry up chicken and or steak and place that on top. Stir frys with spinach instead of noodles and basic vegetables and steak combos. I took Probiotics everyday and Stayed on olive leaf extract for about 6 weeks at 2 x 3000mg. I would like to stress that I saw no relief in my Candida symptoms for 9 weeks, though after treating it with topical cream, it would take 4 or 5 days to return instead of the next day. I would also eat plenty of Garlic."

The probiotics I used are called Swisse Probiotic 100 Billion, but then switched to Swanson Ultimate probiotic formula 66 billion (ebay) I ate plenty of Yoghurt. Fruitless Unsweetened. Many yoghurts that say unsweetened still have a high level of “Natural sugars” so I made sure that Carbs did not exceed 9gm per 100gm and sugars were around 6gm per 100gm. I would class my symptoms as Chronic. I remember thinking that I can’t imagine anyone else has it as bad as me. I had discharge and infection pretty much everyday and it was often painful. Most of the times intercourse was too painful. Before taking the Antibiotics in question I was still fairly symptomatic with an infection every week, but If I was to not take my Olive leaf extract I would get discharge that day. Kefir was not part of my diet."

I am a very lean person naturally (5 9″ weighing about 65kgs) but can eat incredibly large amounts of food. I could quite comfortably eat 2 bigmacs, and chicken burger, 2-3 fries and a drink to wash it down in one sitting. But, I do not want to risk my hard work going to waste. However, I started eating 1 Carb meal to start off. This was Pad Thai (Thai Noodles). After this meal I ate diet again. Next night just so happened I had another carb Meal. (Salmon on a bed of Rice). For the rest of the week I ate diet. I avoided sugars for another two or so week after seeing no infections. I started sugars with bananas (Which many sources claim can actually beat Candida). I also did not avoid dairy like so many sites recommend. In saying that I did not find that Dairy made my symptoms worse pre-diet. I have not eaten any white bread yet, but have had rye breads etc. And in all fairness I have had a few McDonalds burgers recently (Which is worse than your store bought white bread) I honestly feel as though I could eat any food now, but weather it is not wanting my hard work to go to waste or just the fact that I like having more energy, I still eat less carbs than I ever did prediet.

On top of this I would drink anywhere from 5 to 12 cups of coffee a day that had two teaspoons of sugar each. I remember that If I drank an energy drink without having olive leaf extract that morning, I would get a thrush flare up within 3 – 4 hours. On my diet, before eating ANYTHING I would check the label religiously. If the product was greater than 3 or 4gm/100gm in sugars, I wouldn’t touch it (Save yoghurt)"

0,jackrackblack,170,"First of all I started out the diet with a detox. During the detox I juiced all green veggies three times a day for five days. I also drank lemon water, a few clay/chia drinks and alot of dandelion/nettle leaf tea and milk thistle. On the fifth day that juicer stopped working, so I returned it. The two days following that I basically pureed the veggies three times a day. One thing that amazed me is my tongue actually started to clear. I could actually see pink on the damned thing for the first time in god knows how long… Well on the eighth day I decided to eat 2 eggs mixed with raw spinach and white onion with a little broccoli and asparagus on the side. This was for breakfast. I did a pureed green veggie shake for lunch and then some steamed bok choy for dinner. Throughout the day I noticed my tongue was slowly becoming coated again.. I can’t really see what could be the problem. Unless I just literally can’t eat anything but eight or so green vegetables… Anyway, this morning I got up and I actually felt pretty damn good (tongue was white, but much less than before.) I ate the same egg recipe and some asparagus spears for breakfast, took vitamin D3, A, C and Super B Complex and left. I actually felt healthy for a few hours there. It was amazing. BUT I just got home and made myself a salad with organic romaine, organic spinach, cucumber, and 1 egg sliced. In the middle of eating it the brain fog just body slammed me… My vision closed in, head felt stuffed with cotton etc… It was literally instant… I can’t under stand it.. How did I feel so good and my tongue was so clear and it just vanishes in an instant? There is one thing I didn’t mention, but I don’t see how it could be a problem. For the salad I made a homemade dressing with cucumber, olive oil, one avacado, sea salt, black pepper, cilantro, a small bit of a shallot and a small bit of coconut oil. Could any of these things have triggered my brain fog? On a side not I also made a “hot sauce” that has garlic, white onion, celery and jalapeno in it. Could that damage me this early on? Sorry this is so long. Had alot on my mind and was quite frustrated when this fog slammed me so hard."
0,ChinUp,171,"I have been meaning to post for a few weeks, and since more people have been asking about pain in their right side, I’ll share my experience. I am about 11 months into treatment but have had candida infestation for about 2 years prior to that, and one of the major concerns that I have had once I started treatment is the pain in my right side. Note that upon starting, I was on a strict diet, diflucan and herbal anti-fungals. It has ranged from dull to sharp on the right, just under the rib area. My doctor ordered an ultrasound to check my gallbladder and liver area for gallstones. The ultrasound did not find any stones. The pain only got worse, especially during heavy die off. After doing some searching around, I was led to find that I may benefit from a liver flush, Dr. Clark’s liver flush: http://curezone.com/cleanse/liver/huldas_recipe.aspI followed the steps for the lemon juice version. I was curious to see if I would get any, and after only the first attempt, I had hundreds of stones ranging from marble sized to small “chaff”. I was shocked at how many came out! You can tell they are stones because they float, and many are pea green colored – some are tan colored, but when you dissect them, they are bright pea green on the inside.The pressure on my side was less, and the pain was less, but seemed to return after a few days. I later read that this is typical, since the stones further up the bilary ducts get pushed forward once there is room from the stones in front being expelled.I performed another flush 2 weeks after the first one. I did not follow the rule of eating no fat for breakfast and lunch, which is a key step, and had less stones, but still in the hundreds.I performed my third flush 2 weeks after that, and had less stones than the 2nd try…until that evening! I passed 4-5 stones the size of a small egg – HUGE! The next morning I passed 5-6 more! 2 weeks later, fourth flush = less small stones, 5-6 large (ping pong ball sized) at night, 5-7 more in the morning.I am planning to do my fifth flush this weekend. The pain before starting this was constant and strong, and now it is dull, usually only noticeable after meals. I have had seemingly never ending die off – candida in stool and on penis glans. Only after the 3rd and fourth flush did it finally start to seem under control. I am not passing candida and the glans are not flaring up. It seems as though lessening to burden on the liver and increasing bile flow is the hump I needed to get over in order to reach the next stage. I will keep you all posted on my progress."

One thing to note is that she recommends apple juice to soften stones prior to the flush – I of course did not drink any apple juice, but I do drink Apple Cider Vinegar daily with a meal. There is also the option of taking Malic Acid to soften the stones. I also recommend a high quality olive oil – I used Braggs. It can be difficult to drink a 1/2 cup of olive oil!"
3,flashas9,171,"http://curezone.org/forums/fm.asp?i=496806#i Did some background reading on this, and apparently bile is directly connected with keeping good bacteria intact. Research showed, that problems to produce bile, lead to bacterial overgrowth problems. Appendix is involved. It can be both SIBO and Candida, parasites we all are dealing with, and struggling for a longer time to restore organ functions and dealing with bacteria in more difficult – fight back mode, instead of fixing liver functions directly with a flush and herbs. Do you truly believe, that candida release that many toxic waste, and 100% of it disappears easily to the blood or out of the body? The guy who posted in curezone.org link i provided, noticed it wisely, they accumulate and make it hard for us to clear out. Candida is essential for immune system, when working with other bacteria. Do some reading, you will be surprised."

0,d5greene,176,"I am a 25 year old male and about 2 years ago I went on a trip and chain smoked and didn’t brush my teeth for a few days while I stayed by myself. I woke up and my lips were stuck together and came home covered in white stuff which looked like thrush. Now every 4-5 months I get an outbreak and I can feel it happening. My tongue is completely white and the trush covers the back of my throat, sides of my mouth, and even on my lips. I can see it coming and it spreads and takes 2-3 weeks to go away on its on. I have been using salt water all day to rinse my mouth but I can still continue to see it spread. As of right now it is very small and you cannot see it but in a few days the white will be ALL over my lips and will make it very hard for me to eat or even go out in public as it looks disgusting. I have went to two doctors and both of them gave me nothing to help or told me nothing of what to do, probably because I don’t have insurance. I want this to go away permanently as it is ruining my life. I don’t have a lot of money and no insurance. I have been dealing with this for two years and it constantly comes back no matter what I do. Even when I feel it coming on I will use rubbing alcohol, peroxide, salt water, mouth wash, and nothing seems to fight it off. It’s going to show up, spread around like it does, and go away in 2-3 weeks. I am so confused as to what I am reading from all of these places. I read these stories of people thinking they have candida because they are “tired” and I want to slap them in the face. Try walking around with white stuff all over your lips that bleed when messed with and burns when you eat or drink anything. You really think you have a problem now? Someone please help me I don’t know what to do"
1,ThomasJoel2,176,What is your diet like? Do you have any other health problems?
2,bouncygal,176,"Hey,hey,hey tiredness is a shit, i lost my job because of my extreme fatigue! But still what you have sounds awful, i would try some antifungal things like coconut oil and apple cider vinagar, i would treat it like girls do with yeast infections down there. and then i guess a change of diet is a good start too. CUT OUT THE SUGAR Bouncy"
3,Blborden,176,Try oil pulling with coconut oil every morning. Make it a part of your daily hygiene routine and your problem won’t return. I suspect you have a fungus lying dormant beneath plaque. When the plaque is disturbed by brushing the fungus is released and you have an outbreak. The oil pulling will kill the fungus as it is released and eventually remove all dormant fungus and plaque. You can google the methods of oil pulling. It has been done for hundreds of years. The key is consistency. Good luck.
4,stifoo,176,Neem oil tastes like poo but is a strong antifungal. Brush with that and baking soda only. Rinse with hydrogen peroxide. Go get a strong probiotic and have yourself tested for candida overgrowth…take the probiotic many times throughout the day and never smoke another cigarette…full of fungus. Stop eating sugar and drinking all alcohol immediately. Good luck!
5,Vegan Catlady,176,"The fact that your body can make it go away eventually tells me you have a functioning immune system 🙂 The fact that it comes back tells me there might be habits worth breaking that lower your immunity,even temporarily. Coconut oil gave me a terrible reaction, since it can if the candida is really out of control,but drinking coconut milk is helping. If pulling oil gets too intense, try the milk. Oil will be stronger and more helpful though. Build that immune system up if its lacking. Does the candida come back after a fun weekend of drinking? Is your diet a healthy one? Are you working out your kidneys with high protein? Making any organ “tired” will lower immunity 🙂"
6,dwa,176,"Try a mouthwash of Citricidal grape fruit seed extract but be careful with it. It’s strong stuff and there is a good deal of literature available that suggests it’s active ingredient is in fact synthetically added Benzethonium Chloride, which is highly, highly toxic and is not approved for human consumption in Europe or the USA. However, when used diluted as per the packet instructions I think it’s the most effective short term anti-fungal. I have used it against colds, sore throats, oral thrush, stomach parasites and a few bad attacks of candidiasis for about 15 years and I’m OK. I am prepared to risk taking something poisonous and unnatural if it kills the symptoms quickly when used with caution (don’t exceed the concentration/dosage on the packet). I imagine it’s bad for your tooth enamel as well, so if it’s not working within a day or two, give up on it. For longer term anti-fungal (and in addition to the citricidal) swallowing coconut oil and garlic should be helpful. Swilling olive oil round your mouth has a temporary effect on oral thrush and should stop it growing. The main thing is that you need to give up smoking -if you’re still smoking, that is probably the immediate cause of your problem and the reason it does not respond to mouthwash etc. Also take sugar out of your diet immediately."
0,kjones02,177,"I thought I share this b-complex vitamin that I take from time to time. I have varied with a lot of b vitamins in the past always trying to find the right one, since last year. Then, I started taking country’s life b-complex vitamin. I thought it was good, kept me calm, but I worried about the soy in it. However, I know a few of the supplements my nd (raster’s nd) has gave me has soy in it, but one is to help me sleep, and plus a little is good for memory. I just watch it, and don’t take it all the time. Anyways, I found this new and improved b-vitamin that I have been trying off and on for quite awhile. Sometimes it is too much for me; other times, it really helps me get stuff done in the worst candida die-off mode where I can still function on doing something and get the energy to get it done amazing. Then, I think, wow, I must be really absorbing this complex. I feel the energy almost instantly; I can’t say that with other b vitamins. Also, I can say that I think that is does a better job of keeping my sugar balance in check if I stray a little from diet because I have had problems with sugar highs and lows. Actually, I have dumped half the capsule of 1 into a empty capsules I have and made it into 2 doses for me because my body is sensitive. Only take this vitamin in the morning, unless you want to be up all night. My nd said it is best to get vitamins in their active form, and this has it. I haven’t taken the full 2 capsules recommended for this vitamin, maybe some people need it, but I am fine with just a teeny amount. I am a very small guy, due to my history of candida, gastroparesis, and no colon now (lots of problems). =0 I just thought I would share this because it is a very advanced vitamin, and I think can help some of you candida sufferers like me put you in a better mood and give you some energy on those rough days, or days you know your going to do a lot.

0,Misty,178,"I’ve been on a candida diet for several months now; I’ve eliminated sugar, gluten, corn, soy, etc. even though I’ve found some great healthy and creative ways to get the food I need, I struggle with sticking to a healthy routine. I don’t eat the foods on the ‘no’ list, but I tend to go overboard with the foods that I can eat. For example, I can’t just eat a little bit of nuts, I crave them and find myself eating way too much in one Sitting. Even a bag of raw almonds can drive me crazy. Oftentimes I’ll eat a full meal ( like veggies sautéed with eggs or a salmon pattie with avocado and veggies) and I’ll still continue grazing afterwards. Like a LOT. When I’m not even hungry anymore. I feel out of control, and that I’m sabotaging my progress. At this rate, I feel as though I will never get relief from my symptoms ( brain fog, low energy, bloating, constipation, irritability, depression…) does anyone else struggle with eating too much? Usually I do fine for most I the day and struggle with cravings and overeating in the afternoon or evening."
1,raster,178,"Hello Misty, If you were to address your nutritional deficiencies, this likely would solve all of your problems. Your body is craving the foods because it is needing something that you aren’t feeding it. You could do a general vitamin and/or mineral test to see what are your deficiencies and then try to address those. This should reduce the cravings. -raster"

3,Misty,178,"Thank you, I am definitely still struggling. But I know the triggers and am recognizing my weaknesses, so I can avoid being in a situation where it’s easy to go off the path of eating healthy. I actually have been tested for deficiencies before, and while I think that’s part of it, a lot if it is emotional as well. It’s hard To have everyone around me eating whatever they want, when I have to be so strict. Lately, I haven’t been putting in the effort as much, and I’ve given up a few times, thinking I’ll be good the next day.

1,TheChosenOne,179,"Do you know what the cause is of your migraine? An under functioning thyroid can be the cause of that. Caffeine drains your adrenals, which you need for your immune system.

I can say that since being on the diet that the ‘regular’ headaches have diminished greatly! I think the meds may have maybe 65mg of caffeine, similar to Excedrin, or equal to maybe a cup of coffee. At this point I don’t have an alternative to the meds. I will just try to go with the smallest dose I can."

My doctor lately has diagnosed me with IBS and i am confused and well kind of on edge. I feel like a mad person running in all directions with no help at all, heres whats confusing me the most: From what ive read green leafy vegetables can cause the bloating and gas with regard to the IBS symptoms, and with candida those are the most vegetables that you should be eating, it seems to me that green leafy vegetables are good for candida diet but not good for IBS. What vegetables do i eat?Theres not much vegetables left if i think about it that can help my condition or am i suppose to be doing a candida diet at all?

Should i be seeking any professional help?Can a dietitian help me, im a working student so its quite heavy on my pocket to go through all this but im tired of feeling drained with nothing and no one out there to help me 🙁 If this is the diet thats going to help me, Im from South Africa where can i buy those 3 meds before i start the diet from? Please help!!!!Im desperate"
1,Thomas,180,"Hi mate, you cant address these two issues at the same time. If you guess around it will drive you nuts. As long as you dont have prove that you have candida you should not only assume you have it. If you have an IBS with constipation than the high fibre diet here fighting against candida will be good for you. So dont worry about that. If you have an IBS type overflow IBS, that is high speed of digestion and diarrhoea, you should NOT follow this diet as it is high in fiber which will irritate your guts more giving you more diarrhoea. Check first if you have IBS and heal yourself. I found IBS the essential guide from Professor John Hunter a great book. There you can find out which type of IBS you have. If you have constipation type of IBS you can safly do the diet here as it is high in fiber and in this case will only help you. You see there are different types of IBS. If you suffer like most IBS folks from stress and anxiety. You should test EFT from Gary Craig. Its free on-line and helped me a lot. hope that helps cheers Thomas"
2,Able900,180,"Hello, Nabs.From what ive read green leafy vegetables can cause the bloating and gas with regard to the IBS symptoms, and with candida those are the most vegetables that you should be eating, it seems to me that green leafy vegetables are good for candida diet but not good for IBS. What vegetables do i eat? Theres not much vegetables left if i think about it that can help my condition or am i suppose to be doing a candida diet at all? The fact is that when you have a Candida infestation, bloating occurs with basically all foods part of the time and at least some foods all of the time. In other words, it’s difficult to avoid bloating when you have Candida unless you do something about it.  Of course the best thing to do is to cure your infestation. But since this can’t be done overnight, the next best thing is to add Betaine HCL (hydrochloride) to your diet right away. Take one table during your meal. If you still experience terrible bloating, take two tables during the next meal.  Another important thing to remember is that, the trigger foods for IBS are often the same foods that you should avoid on a Candida diet. For example; extremely greasy foods and cooking in a lot of grease should be avoided. FYI: Your body needs to have a certain amount of oil every day, and there are ‘safe’ oils which will not aggravate IBS. Other foods which aggravate IBS and can also be avoided on a Candida diet are pizza, red meat, French fries (all potatoes should be avoided during a Candida diet), and extremely spicy foods (such as pizza), also milk, cheese, ice cream and gluten. Since a lot of vegetables eaten raw cause problems with IBS, you can lightly steam all of your vegetables on the Candida diet if you need to. Be sure to use extra virgin coconut oil or EVO.  So the bottom line is, you can and probably should go on a good Candida diet. The link below is a post concerning the connection between IBS and Candida; you can read it for more information on curing both Candida and IBS. Candida, Leaky Gut Syndrome, Allergies, & IBS Connection  Let us know if you have questions about the protocol (link below). The Protocol Able"
3,Javizy,180,"You could try a 2-week diet to see if you can relieve your bloating before starting the candida protocol. Vegetables like bok choy, carrot, celeriac, courgette, cucumber, green beans, parsnip, spinach, sweet potato and turnip should be fine. You want to keep things as simple as possible to find out what you can tolerate. Sticking to olive oil for fat and chicken for protein should allow you to avoid any potential allergens. Sweet potato, parsnip and carrot contain some carbs which should help the initial transition to low-carb eating. Cutting carbs out completely in one go can make the initial die-off even more horrendous, if not dangerous in some cases. If you get relief after two-weeks, then you can start introducing new foods and removing the starchy vegetables as you shift to the candida protocol. The diet is basically just a “safe” foods list for IBS and IBD sufferers. I wasted a lot of time by jumping straight in and assuming everything would work out. Asparagus, broccoli, cabbage etc gave me a lot of problems and I was eating them daily. There’s always the potential you’re sensitive to eggs, coconut and other staples on the protocol, so easing into it is a good way to play things safe. It’s a long-term commitment, so it’s best to go about it methodically."

I would like to try to eat something besides just vegetables and meat, because I feel very draggy without any carbs besides what’s in my vegetables. Any thoughts?"
1,TheChosenOne,183,"Hi Jennybear. How long are you on the diet? Most things you mentioned should be quite safe and most of them aren’t ‘real’ grains. So, I’d suggest there is something else wrong. What kind of symptoms are you talking about?"
2,jennybear1978,183,"Hi. I’ve been struggling with the diet for a month or so. I started just on an anti-inflammatory diet, not realizing I had Candida. It was only when I had a strong reaction to antibiotics that I realized what was going on. I’m waiting to see a naturopath on Thursday, so I haven’t had a complete confirmation yet, but all the symptoms and the improvement on the diet seem to fit. The symptoms I have are very histamine related. I get a sinus drip, and a headache all around my head. I’ve noticed this same reaction to eggs and legumes."

4,raster,183,Vitamin C has been shown to reduce histamine levels by 25% so be sure to be taking vitamin C.

0,marxoxoshizzle,184,"I’m a 25 year old female who believes Candida is the cause of all her issues. A few years ago, around 2008 or so, I had sex with a guy I was seeing who didn’t know he had chlamydia. I found out when I got my very first full blown yeast infection. When I went in to my OBGYN to get it looked at, they did some tests…Called me a few days later and said, by the way, you have chlamydia. They gave me 1 pill to clear it up (I can’t remember what it was) and medication for the yeast infection. It cleared up, but a few weeks or a month or so later I felt symptoms return. This then became a pattern. Prior to this I was able to have sex as much as I wanted and would not experience any infections or irritation of any sort. Now I am in a relationship of 5 years and it sucks because I get a yeast infection almost EVERY single time I have sex. It used to be every few times, then every other time, now it is every single time. So just a month ago I got another infection and ran out of my usual prescription of Diflucan. I called my gyno and she told me that she couldn’t keep giving me antifungals for the rest of my life and reccommended I see a “holistic doctor.” She gave me the name to an acupuncturist I have been seeing me who has been treating me with herbal remedies. That was all good and well. She claimed she could cure my “damp heat” (what they call candida or yeast) and after all of the research I have ever done, I was skeptical. So this past week I went in the gyno again to have my annual exam and asked if she could get me a lab order for a Candida antibodies blood test to be sure. Sure enough, I get a call today saying the test came back positive for it all in high levels. Now I am unsure of what to do. I have done lots of research on these cell wall suppressors with little evidence that it works…Not many reviews out there unless I dig through forums like this one for hours. I am curious about CandElim and the TotalFlora15 combination. I read good things about it but one person on here said it worked and then it stopped working a few weeks after the treatment was finished. I cannot say whether or not my Candida is severe. I can list a few of the things I feel…. Overall extreme fatigue and lack of energy headaches every now and then severe allergies to grass that I didn’t always have (I can’t skip a day of Claritin-D now) recurring vaginal yeast infections decreased libido (although I attribute this to 10 years of oral birth control pills that I quite 4 months ago) foggy thinking and bad memory muscle weakness So really I don’t feel terrible except for when I try to exercise, after I have sex (bc then I get an infection) and the fact that I don’t sleep WELL every single night and wake up often, sometimes sweating. I have never been a regular pooper, although now I am taking these Juice Plus fruit & vegetable vitamins because I don’t eat either fruits or vegetables really…These vitamins are making me go to the bathroom every day if not every other day. Which is extremely regular for me, and I am happy about this. But I want to know what you guys think I should try. Something that isn’t too complicated and requires a sort of plan that I can stick to. I am good at remembering to take things on a daily basis a few times a day if needed. The only thing I worry about with the cell wall suppressors and all that is that I am worried about the die-off I’ve been reading about. I am afraid to get really sick from it. Some people report no die-off or very mild, others so severe they can’t go to work. I cannot afford not to go to work obviously. I would really like to try CandElim or products OF THE SAME type as that, that can kill the candida and such. So please, if you have tried any of these things I would like to know and how well it worked for you. I don’t eat any fruits or vegetables at all, no. Instead I supplements with multivitamins by a company who makes something called JuicePlus. They are “the next best thing to fruits and vegetables.” And I have noticed a difference in my digestive health while taking in them because as I said in my post, I never go to the bathroom (#2) more than maybe 3 times a week if that. When I started taking the vitamins I started going every day if not every other day. A normal day in what I eat usually consists of this: breafkast: A bowl of frosted mini wheats or frosted flakes cereal (I work in an office 8 hours a day M-F) lunch: usually skip this, if not I have a bowl of microwavable mac and cheese. on occasion I have pizza or Chinese food. Dinner: depends on the day. Either baked Chicken breasts, fried pork chops, usually with white rice or mashed potatoes. I may go out to eat occasionally to Outback or something I usually just order steak and baked potato. So my diet consists of mostly meat items with whatever side item I choose, but it’s usually a potato type dish or pasta. Every Wednesday I cook spaghetti & Meatballs for dinner. is there ANY WAY I can change my diet without resorting to eating nothing but fruits and vegetables??? What people don’t understand about me is that I do not CHOOSE not to eat fruits or vegetables. I simply do not tolerate their taste. I have not eaten fruits or vegetables probably since I was an infant, and that is not simply because I don’t want to. Because I do know just how important it is to have them in my diet…I just can’t stand them. The only fruit I tolerate, and I say tolerate because they’re the only ones I’m willing to say, oh, this isn’t gross, are: peaches, pairs, mandarin oranges, nectarines. So far those are the only fruits I can stand. As far as vegetables go? None. Zero. Zip. Zilch. There is not ONE vegetable I find tasty, appealing, delicious, or even remotely tolerable. They all make me gag. I don’t know why, or if I have overactive taste buds or what. Maybe I was a T-Rex in my past life, who knows. As far as making sure I get enough calories through out the day, I can TRY this, but because I am so busy at work I just forget sometimes to stop and eat. Which is why most of the time I may only get by on 2 meals a day and a small snack in between. I can say that I do spend most of the day feeling hungry and sometimes even really light headed and starved…But I am so busy I don’t have time to stop and eat. I know I am killing myself this way so I really do want to change. There just has to be a better way to take in the vegetables than by actually eating them. Especially not raw. I don’t want to taste them AT ALL. I mostly eat chicken or pork and it’s always seasoned with garlic and oregano and vinegar. I am Puerto Rican, so my seasoning is the same for every meat type I prepare. I need a specific diet plan, and meal types that I can eat. When people tell me “eat greens” and just that, I am still lost, as that is not exactly enough for me to know what to cook or have on a daily basis. I need examples, or a list of foods I am allowed to eat vs. what I should not eat. The candida diets are very strict and difficult and basically eliminate any and all food that I eat regularly. Sorry, I know this is long, but please write back and tell me what you think. I am currently taking Juice Plus garden and orchard blend, RAW probiotics that guarantee 100BILLION CFU of 32 strains I believe of good bacteria, Fem-Dophilus probiotic for feminine health."

It seems to me that you have to change your taste, get used to more bitter things. Take a few drops of Swedish Bitters before every meal. After a while, try to eat some vegetables. If you don’t throw up, you will be fine and you can start the diet. The diet you are talking about is not something light. There are no shortcuts or easy ways. You have to take it seriously. If not, you’re probably gonna be sick for the rest of your life. Read the protocol for more information about the cleanse, the diet and antifungals/probiotics."
2,marxoxoshizzle,184,"really? thanks for the advice but being rude by basically calling me a child isn’t the way to go here. i’m obviously seeking advice because i WANT to get better. i am aware of my problems and posted here because i want to change, and yes, i am an adult. i am 25 years old. my reasoning for not eating vegetables at all is simply because I DO NOT LIKE THEM. my dislike for them greatly outweighs my body’s need to have them. any time i try to eat them i gag or chew on them for half an hour. i can literally taste the -came out of the ground- flavor and i hate that."
3,TheChosenOne,184,"You’re gonna have to eat vegetables somehow, because it’s almost the only thing that you can eat in the beginning. Meats are also limited. Have you tried all vegetables? You can always try to eat soup or veggie juices. Also, a lot of spices and salt are allowed. For the record, I didn’t call you a child."
4,marxoxoshizzle,184,"No, I haven’t tried ALL vegetables. Just the ones I’ve been exposed to by whatever my parents were cooking or if my boyfriend orders something with stuff in it he always makes me try things. I’ve just never liked them. I wish that I didn’t feel that way because I do know how important they are. I know that taking supplements doesn’t replace them, but they are better than nothing. And they ARE working in the sense that, prior to taking them I was going #2 probably two times a week, now I barely miss a day and sometimes go twice a day. I really want to try a candida diet, but I am afraid that the one Able900 uses is just a little too limited. It also lasts like an entire year. -Sigh- I am just at a loss and wish that there was ONE diet. Not 40million versions of them from random sites and people. I know what works for some may not work for others, but sheesh. Some of this junk is real complicated and I don’t want to mess up. What do you do??"
5,mylittlecam,184,Have you tried a green smoothie? Totally different taste then eating a plate of veggies.
6,marxoxoshizzle,184,"I have not, but i would definitely be willing to try it as long as it doesn’t taste like total sludge. Please, give me a recipe you reccommend that tastes pretty good!!! One of my vegan/vegetarian friends told me that she puts kale and spinach and all that yucky stuff in there but then throws in some peaches or apples for flavor. but those things have sugar…so i don’t know what to do!"
7,mylittlecam,184,"I’m following Ann Boroch The Candida Cure which allows a small hand full of berries a day. I don’t measure my stuff, so it’s kind of give and take. I use a powerful blender, so I make a big batch. 2 cups water or (I use water kefir for the probiotics) a bunch of spinach (I put a lot in mine – maybe start out small and build as you become accustomed to the taste)(as your taste become more accustomed you can switch this up by adding kale, broccoli, collards – you name it) 1/4 – 1/2 avocado to make smooth(can switch to banana once you’re farther along on plan) tiny piece of lemon rind (this helps the iron absorb from the spinach) 6 frozen strawberries stevia to sweeten. The other thing you can do is juice your greens and if have too, plug your nose until you can handle it better, and just drink quickly. Drink on empty stomach to absorb the nutrients. Much better then fake stuff. Good Luck:)"
8,raster,184,"Here is my strict food list I created: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx I would recommend sticking to this food list and taking a few specific supplements. You need something to support your liver to detox the toxins. You need to come up with a detox plan. You need a long term safe antifungal…the one I recommend the most is SF722 undecenoic acid. Check out the reviews, its a pretty powerful product. You’ll also need a good strong probiotic. There is only one on the market that contains human derived strains of probiotic and its called HMF neuro. This is the most effective probiotic on the market in my opinion. The second most effective probiotic is one that contains the DDS-1 strain. If you don’t like vegetables and do not consume them then you are going to have serious health problems in the future. You need the minerals, vitamins, and nutrients found within them to repopulate your beneficial gut flora. This is likely a very strong reason you are here in the first place. If you have mineral and vitamin deficiencies then this is a pathway to disease. My recommendation: consider juicing vegetables and making smoothies out of them. Combine a bunch of stuff that is very healthy that you would not eat. For instance, combine kale, brazil nut, some berries, kefir, protein powder, celery, avocado, chard, etc. all into a smoothie. Drink it real fast and chug some water afterwards and it’ll go down easy. Make a few of these per day and you’ll get proper nutrition. If you do not consume vegetables I do not think you will get better. -raster"
0,marxoxoshizzle,185,"So, I was doing some Googling on the type of smoothies I should be having. Many people have said to me that if I don’t like to eat vegetables with my food, that having green smoothies with some approved fruits is a better and easier alternative. I was all ready to try this and start searching for recipes that may actually taste okay, when I came upon this website making me think twice. Now I don’t know what to do. Read below : ———– Green smoothies are all the rage these days with many people consuming them every day or at least several times a week in an attempt to get healthy and “alkalize” the body. Whenever I visit the cafe of my local healthfood store, there are usually several people in gym clothes lined up to order a green smoothie to sip after their workout. Green smoothies are made by blending large amounts of raw leafy green vegetables with fruit to soften and sweeten the taste. Typical vegetables included in green smoothies are kale, spinach, swiss chard, collard greens, celery, broccoli, and parsley. Is the green smoothie fad a truly healthy habit over the long term or can consumption of these seemingly healthy drinks in fact contribute to serious health problems? Raw Leafy Greens Contain High Oxalate Levels Frequent consumption of large quantities of raw, leafy green vegetables as occurs when a person drinks green smoothies can be deceiving at first as a person will probably initially feel great after adopting this habit particularly if he or she is coming off a highly processed, nutrient poor diet. The vegetables used in green smoothies are almost without exception high oxalate foods. Over time, a high oxalate diet can contribute to some very serious health problems particularly if you are one of the 20% of people (1 in 5) that have a genetic tendency to produce oxalates or if you suffer from candida or other fungal challenge. In those cases, a high oxalate diet can deal a devastating blow to health. Oxalate Toxicity Not a New Problem Humans have suffered the effects of oxalate toxicity since ancient times. A 2000 year old mummy from Chile was discovered through x-ray analysis to have an oxalate kidney stone about the size of a golf ball! Oxalates can be deposited almost anywhere in the body and wherever they land, pain or worse is the result. 75-90% of kidney stones are oxalate related with 10-15% of Americans afflicted at some point during their lives. As the star shaped crystalline stones pass from the kidney, they cause pressure and pain in the bladder and urethra and can actually tear up the walls of the urinary tract. Oxalate Stones Can Form in Any Tissue Oxalate stones can show up in any body tissue including the brain and even the heart. Oxalate crystals resembling shards of glass which become lodged in the heart cause tiny tears and damage to this vital muscle with every single contraction pumping life giving blood to the rest of the body. Oxalate crystals which end up in the thyroid can cause thyroid disease by damaging thyroid tissue. A frequent location for oxalates to end up is skeletal muscle which will cause pain with even normal movement and make exercise nearly impossible. Dr. William Shaw, Director of The Great Plains Laboratory for Health, Nutrition and Metabolism who has studied oxalates extensively, is convinced that oxalate toxicity is a factor in fibromyalgia the pain of which can absolutely devastate a person’s life. Vulvodynia – Painful Sex Cases of women experiencing painful sex are on the rise with oxalates a possible culprit. Vulvodynia, a condition causing pain in and around the vagina, is linked to oxalates deposited in this delicate reproductive tissue. Oxalate crystals are very acidic and they cause irritation, burning, and stinging sensations for affected women with an accompanying feeling of rawness whenever they engage in sexual relations. Oxalates Are Fungal in Origin A surprising finding is that oxalates are produced in large amounts by fungus. Large stones have been found in the sinuses and lungs of people suffering from systemic fungal infections such as candida or Aspergillus. Therefore, anyone who suffers from any sort of candida or other fungal challenge like fungus nails or dandruff would be wise to be very concerned about oxalate intake via the diet. Consumption of green smoothies would not in any way contribute to improvement of health in these situations. Given that the majority of people today suffer from gut imbalance/fungal issues caused by antibiotic and prescription drug use along with consumption of processed foods, a high oxalate diet which includes green smoothies is an unwise practice for virtually everyone. Does Cooking Destroy Oxalates? Would it be safe to prepare green smoothies with leafy greens that have been lightly steamed first? Not really, because oxalates are extremely stable and while cooking high oxalate foods like leafy greens (and discarding the cooking water) does reduce the oxalate level, it remains quite high. Since green smoothies are consumed so frequently by those who swear by them, a light steaming of the veggies first would not make a significant difference over the long term. Healthier Alternatives to Green Smoothies The best course of action for health, then, is to opt out of the green smoothie fad. If you enjoy green leafy vegetables, enjoy them in moderation in salads or cook them and carefully drain and discard all the cooking water – never use it in soups and sauces! Be sure to serve cooked leafy greens with a healthy, traditional fat like butter (not margarine or any factory fats synthesized with rancid and/or GMO vegetable oils) for maximum absorption of minerals. Another option is to drink raw cultured vegetable juice or eat raw cultured vegetables. Not only will you get enhanced nutrition from the culturing process which adds enzymes and nutrients, but you will also get a beneficial and therapeutic dose of probiotics to help balance gut function and improve digestion. Another option is to do shots of fresh, green wheatgrass juice. Wheatgrass juice is very low in oxalic acid. If you already are suffering from some of the ailments described in this article and suspect a high oxalate diet which includes green smoothies or a daily spinach salad may be the cause, stop this practice immediately and consult with a holistic physician who can guide you on the road to recovery and how to best rid your body of the oxalate crystals that are potentially irritating one or more of your body tissues. Sarah, The Healthy Home Economist author, Get Your Fats Straight Source: The Role of Oxalates in Autism and Chronic Disorders, William Shaw PhD How Green Smoothies Can Devastate Your Health ———————————— Now, after reading all this junk I’m totally freaked out. I HAVE ACTUALLY had the blood test done and it said my Candida levels in my intestines basically were above the norm, and also the amount of it in my mucous membranes. Has anyone had the green shakes and actually seen results/felt better? I am doing the best I can at cutting out sugary foods, because the strict diet is simply not an option for me. I fear I suffer from extreme adrenal fatigue, as exercise is nearly impossible for me, and am afraid the strict diet would basically kill me. I also mostly eat meat and carbs and just can’t stop cold turkey to just eat grass every day, which is why I wanted to try the shakes instead. Thoughts??"
1,ChinUp,185,"I recommend getting your own blender or processor of smoothies are a must for you. you can make some interesting stuff, like pumpkin seed, jalapeno, ginger root,spirulina, a few frozen blueberries , unsweetened coconut milk or homemade kefir and a small amount of frozen greens with stevia. I’ve done the strict diet, and the one thing I’m sure of is that everyone is different. You need to listen to your body and there are plenty of foods that will cause issues in excess."
2,marxoxoshizzle,185,"I don’t know what my body is telling me other than that it would love to get these nutrients without having to EAT the vegetables lol. Earlier I tried a bite of a cucumber and I gagged. Not sure what it is about greens in general. I just don’t enjoy them. My concern though is about the smoothies and this claim by this person that the oxalates in them are more harmful than not, making the green smoothies or greens in general a bad idea for most people to live solely off of."
0,myword12345,186,"Just letting you all know what seems to be working for me…. I started the diet I cut everything but 1 piece of bread and my one cup of coffee other then that eggs and vegetables. Die off omg bad!!!!!! I couldn’t have told you what day it was,anxiety attack after anxiety attack,I cried ,My stomach hurt so bad, fever ,sweating, on and on it was bad! Then I started to get to where I could think more but very weak! I cut the coffee and bread keep going on the diet. I bought every book I could fine, I have done nothing but research, research how to get better. I started taking cultured vegetables about a month ago. That caused some die off but nothing like the first time. Then all of a sudden I started pooping and all sorts of stuff was in it at different times. mucus, white specs, even worm looking things. Sorry I know gross but exciting for me! I started with just a spoon and have moved up to half a cup. I was still getting bloated and so tired. I changed to eating 80% veg and 20 % protein things started moving much better and not as much bloat. Now I have started the coconut keifer 2 spoons a day. Again die off a lot of sweating exhausted like a bad flu but still not as bad as the start. Last night the jelly fish came out!I have read about candida in your stool and that sometimes it looks like a jelly fish. It sure did about as big as my hand.( I did the happy dance!!!!) after that 2 more times very healthy waste last night. I woke u feeling much better today and excited to see what is next in my path to healing. What I am working on now is balance. I am the type that has to to push hard I want it now. What I have learned is you cant have everything now. It has to be in steps. I would push real hard in one way and have bad die off cut back then push in another and have to back off. So now I am trying to push a little in all ways lol hope it leads to success !"

0,alexalgebra,189,"I’ve been having these cravings for black pepper on everything, even though in the past, I didn’t care for it much. I just did a little research on it to make sure that it wasn’t going to be doing anything bad to me and found this out: (From [http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=74](http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=74))Improve Digestion and Promote Intestinal Health Black pepper (Piper nigrum)stimulates the taste buds in such a way that an alert is sent to to the stomach to increase hydrochloric acid secretion, thereby improving digestion. Hydrochloric acid is necessary for the digestion of proteins and other food components in the stomach. When the body’s production of hydrochloric acid is insufficient, food may sit in the stomach for an extended period of time, leading to heartburn or indigestion, or it may pass into the intestines, where it can be used as a food source for unfriendly gut bacteria, whose activities produce gas, irritation, and/or diarrhea or constipation. Black pepper has long been recognized as a carminitive, (a substance that helps prevent the formation of intestinal gas), a property likely due to its beneficial effect of stimulating hydrochloric acid production. In addition, black pepper has diaphoretic (promotes sweating), and diuretic (promotes urination) properties. Black pepper has demonstrated impressive antioxidant and antibacterial effects–yet another way in which this wonderful seasoning promotes the health of the digestive tract. And not only does black pepper help you derive the most benefit from your food, the outer layer of the peppercorn stimulates the breakdown of fat cells, keeping you slim while giving you energy to burn.

I told her she needs to start this diet now and knock things out early. The only problem, is that she’s a vegetarian. Nothing wrong with this of course, but I’m worried that since she can’t eat soy products and other things that give her protein, that she wont be getting enough protein. Are there any other vegetarians on this diet? She already eats fish occasionally, mostly because she was just withering away to nothing. She’s good at eating her veggies, but she’s horrible about supplementing the protein she isn’t receiving. She’s also a huge sugar head. I know we can get fresh fish at our local Krogers.

0,yolee,193,I am a new member here and have been browsing around and found an interesting topic by kennyG about metal texocity and candida which makes some sense to me. My herbalist has already told me I have metal texocity and I actually have a dentist appt tomorrow to start the process of getting my fillings replaced. I would like to discuss this topic with any members who believe the heavy metals can have a part in the candida and have gotten their fillings replaced. dvjorge had some opinions on this as well and if he is still around I would like to get some advice from you Thanks Yolee
1,TheChosenOne,193,"I see a lot of people who had their fillings replaced, including me. I think fillings might be one of the causes of candida, but it’s not really sure if this is the case. I think that people who suffer from candida might have more fillings because of a possible bad diet. Anyway. I think it’s a recommended to test if you’re poisoned with mercury or other metals if you think you are. Metal detoxing by doing enemas or saunas is a good idea anyway."
2,yolee,193,Thanks for the reply TheChosenOne. My herbalist did tell me I have metal poisoning that’s the reason I’m getting them removed and she said she usually can’t treat people properly if they do have it that’s why I decided to get them taken out. Although she didn’t tell me anything about not being able to clear up the candida if I have it but I have done the diet already in the past without getting rid of it. I do feel better on the diet but its still there along with my hpylori and parasites as well.  Did you benefit at all from getting yours removed? Thanks  Yolee
3,TheChosenOne,193,"At the time mine were replaced, I had no idea about the fact that I had candida (while I was suffering from it since a quite long time then). They were replaced because of government regulation I think. So, I have no idea if it made a difference to me."
4,Floggi,193,"  Please take care when replacing amalgam dental fillings. The first problem, of course, is that there has never been any proof that amalgam fillings cause these so-called “metal toxicity” problems. There’s even less proof that removing amalgam fillings results in any improvement – other than, of course, the placebo effect that’s caused by the patient’s belief in undergoing such a thing. The second problem is that amalgam fillings are often replaced with composite fillings. These composite fillings contain BPA’s – which were once used in food containers and plastic bottles, but have since been forbidden because BPA’s leek into the food/drink, and they are quite poisonous. Therefore, replacing your amalgam fillings with composite fillings might well worsen the problem.  "

I think everything was trying to go into overdrive and expelling everything with general, spasming peristalsis. It was only ever on the first day, but it was draining and feverish. Viburnum stopped the diarrhea even happening, as it’s an anti-spasmodic. On top of this, I started taking iron supplements for a few days before a period, and this has helped the ‘drained’ feeling quite a bit. It depends on your particular symptoms."

0,Able900,196,"A substance by the name of “lactoferrin’ (Apo-Lactoferrin) has been added to the list of supplements  recommended on in the forum’s protocol. Lactoferrin (Apo-Lactoferrin) is a globular protein or a spheroprotein found in human and animal milk. The Link Between Candida and Iron Deficiency Anemia If you have a mild to strong Candida infestation and it is allowed to continue, then over a period of time it’s also possible or even probable that you will eventually contract iron deficiency anemia. According to a study reported in the journal, “Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy,” iron can improve the immune system’s function while at the same time increasing the susceptibility of Candida to antifungals. However, ironically, iron can also improve the ability of Candida albicans to invade human cells, which, at least in theory would only make the infestation worse. So, as you can imagine, the unfortunate aspect of taking an iron supplement is that it can possibly promote a Candida infestation by benefiting the Candida. The spheroprotein, lactoferrin, has the ability of binding to free iron and thereby preventing the Candida infestation from becoming worse due to iron, but at the same time, those sufferers with specific types of anemia can also have low levels of lactoferrin and therefore be more susceptible to Candida infections. Since lactoferrin binds so easily with iron, it improves the body’s uptake of iron therefore helping to prevent iron deficiency and anemia. Lactoferrin also helps to maintain excellent levels of beneficial bacteria in the intestinal tract which is a big advantage in a good Candida treatment. Lactoferrin is found most often in human and cow’s milk; however, it’s also available in over-the-counter supplements. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration granted a GRAS (generally-recognized-as-safe) status to milk-derived lactoferrin supplementation. Take this supplement during or immediately after a meal. [h]IMPORTANT: A lot of people are allergic to lactoferrin and apo-lactoferrin. Start with a small amount and watch carefully for allergic reactions. Take this supplement only for only three days, then stop taking it for a week, then three more days, etc. I wouldn’t take Apo L for more than 27 days total. That’s 9 x 3 days with a week off every 3 days; but this is only if you’re absolutely sure that you need it and that you need it for that long. It wouldn’t hurt to have your iron checked halfway through. Take Apo L several hours apart from any probiotic you may be taking. The natural and best way to obtain iron is still from your diet.  "

8,dvjorge,196,"Abstract Candida albicans was found to be highly susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by enzymatic cleavage of bovine lactoferrin. Effective concentrations of the peptide varied within the range of 18 to 150 g/ml depending on the strain and the culture medium used. Its effect was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability. 14C-labeled lactoferricin B bound to C. albicans and the rate of binding appeared to be consistent with the rate of killing induced by the peptide. The extent of binding was diminished in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions which acted to reduce its anticandidal effectiveness. Binding occurred optimally at pH 6.0 and killing was maximal near the same pH. Such evidence suggests the lethal effect of lactoferricin B results from its direct interaction with the cell surface. Cells exposed to lactoferricin B exhibited profound ultrastructural damage which appeared to reflect its induction of an autolytic response. These findings suggest that active peptides of lactoferrin could potentially contribute to the host defense against C. albicans. Abstract The effects of lactoferrin (LF), an antimicrobial protein secreted in body fluids, and its peptides in combination with azole antifungal agents were investigated by the micro-broth-dilution method in a study of Candida albicans. In the case of LF, its pepsin hydrolysate (LFhyd) or the LF-derived antimicrobial peptide Lactoferricin B (LF-B), the concentrations required to inhibit the growth of Candida decreased in the presence of relatively low concentrations of clotrimazole (CTZ). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of all azole antifungal agents tested was reduced by 1/4-1/16 in the presence of a sub-MIC level of each of these LF-related substances. Polyene and fluoropyrimidine antifungal agents did not show such a combined effect with these LF-related substances. The anti-Candida activity of LF or LF-B in combination with CTZ was shown to be synergistic by checkerboard analysis. These results indicate that LF-related substances function cooperatively with azole antifungal agents against C. albicans. IT MUST BE APO-LACTOFERRIN Abstract Since iron-binding proteins in serum and external secretions inhibit growth of certain microorganisms, the effect of lactoferrin on growth of Candida albicans was determined. The iron-unsaturated protein markedly impaired replication of the yeast, and the growth-inhibitory property was lost when lactoferrin was saturated with iron."

1,raster,198,Check out this candida symptoms list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6305_100-candida-symptoms-list.aspx We are not going to diagnose you with candida so you are asking the wrong question about this. Here are the tests I recommend on the forum: http://www.candidaplan.com/store/Candida-Testing/ The results need to be analyzed by a naturopathic or regular doctor. A lot of your symptoms are not completely related to candida. For instance headaches can often be tied to the inflammation fo the gut. Trembling hands and muscle spasms can be related to deficiencies in trace minerals. Slow healing can be related to a compromised immune system. Acne can be related to the detoxificiation of toxins. -raster

0,henrydavidthoreau,201,"Hello fellow candida-sufferers, I have a question regarding if I just set myself back a few steps or if Im making some progress (finally).. I started antifungals about 4 weeks ago after being on a strict very low carb/no gluten/ no dairy (no bread,rice,pasta etc for a year), only eating veggies and going through a LONG period of elimination of other products that made me react (probably due to histamine intolerance and/or leaky gut), these include eggs,all types of nuts, tomatoes, kefir, legumes and the list goes on.. The major and frankly the only symptoms (I care about)are acne/roscea related along with dizziness when I wake up in the morning and get out of bed, whenever I eat a food I react to (simple carbs or any of the mentioned products) i flare up, feel very warm and swollen in my face, lightheadedness, and the following days I would get new cystic pimples.  During the elimination process all these symptoms improved drastically ALTHOUGH I would get a setback usually after 3-4 weeks, then I would start all over again removing a certain product. I’ve come to the point where I no longer break out due to food (which im happy about), and shortly after I started taking antifungals to remove candida overgrowth. I started off with GSE along with wild oregano extract, the first days I noticed some minor die-off symptoms (very fatigued, lightheadedness, etc). I took this for 2 weeks and moved on to olive oil extract (225mgx3 3x a day) along with some colloidal silver. Around this period I started getting very bloated and my appetite was very supressed, some days I could go without eating at all (although drinking atleast 3-4L of water), and I was very constipated. I started taking a detox-fiber drink which contained bentonite clay, that was very successful, during a 3-4 day period I had 4-5 bm’s a day. However 3 days ago I noticed that my rectum was blocked by some very hard stool (sorry if this is tmi) so I had to go to the doctors since I was extremely bloated and couldnt eat, I was given a laxative that was to be inserted into the rectum, after 2 days of treatment I felt like the blockage was gone (huge bowel movements, sorry), my appetite was coming back fast since I had literally not been able to eat more than 1k calories a day for 3-4 days. A few hours after this blockage removal I noticed flu-like symptoms, very sore throat, cold, runny nose etc, I thought i was getting ill, however the next day 90% of the symptoms were gone, but I did wake up with 2 red bumps on my face (first time in 2 months), is this a die-off sign or have I set myself back somehow? I feel very energetic now as if I never had the flu-symptoms. Also is it possible that it’s something other than candida that is causing my acne/roscea/constipation whenever eating the food im reacting to? My supplements are: Multivitamin 1x C-vitamin 4000mg Milk thistle x2 Calcium 1000mg vit d 25mg vit e 800mg vit a 10000 UI zinc 50mg magnesium 700mg-1000mg MSM + biotin Betaine HCL 5g my current antifungals are colloidal silver olive leaf extract I drink plenty of water, only eat steamed green vegtables along with lamb, only use high quality unrefined sea salt. Any advice would be greatly appriciated, most doctors here in Sweden havnt heard about candida and will try to put me on more antibiotics, which has left me feeling pretty lonely."
1,CiproSucks,201,"Hi Henry. Sounds like you’re doing a lot of the right things, although I’m concerned when you say you only eat lamb with steamed vegetables. That is too strict and limited a diet. Have you experienced any symptoms such as headaches, dry mouth, oral thrush, muscle/joint pain? I’m not an expert at this stuff, but one piece of advice I would give you is to start a Sweden Candida Support Group at Facebook. I can assure you that you’re not the only Candida sufferer in Sweden, and the exchange of information, doctor referrals, etc, would be valuable to you and others in Sweden."
2,raster,201,"I would stop with the bentonite clay because this can cause chronic constipation as you can tell. If your digestion becomes sluggish then this will benefit the bad bugs in the body.

However now im experiencing what i think are swollen adrenal glands, is this a “for sure” die off symptom that my body is detoxing itself from some sort of invader? I picked up the recommended probiotic with DDS-1 and will introduce it when my die-off symptoms subside. Does anyone know what reactions I might have against these probiotics if I have SIBO? Digestion overall has improved alot and I no longer feel like the food “sits” and ferments after I started with bentonite clay&cleaned my colon,will give this a few more weeks and if symptoms dont get any better I guess ill have to visit another doctor, since I dont really know for sure if it’s not SIBO, since i bloat very easily after eating and ingesting anti-fungals/bacterials. Its a tricky ride for sure, thanks for the responses."
0,tszyszko1,202,"Hi everybody I diagnosed candida around three months ago I started diet immediately, although i made couple mistakes  like eating balsamic vinegar, eaten some yoghurt, tofu ive eaten apple two times couple of tyimes ive eaten some fruit im eating avocado frequently im becoming paranoid about this diet and I dont understand if im getting better or not i feel very tired most of the time but from time to time i get energy boost does this energy boost means that ive eaten something candida likes? i want to eat constantly but not sugar particularly maybe im just starving ive eaten bigger portion of buckwheat groats with onion and spinach salad with almonds amd pumpkin sunflower seeds and i feel fine after that but not so boosted CAN I EAT A LOT? or its candida that wants to eat? IS IT ALL LOST AFTER DOING ONE MISTAKE? im eating quite a lot of oats,quinoa,almonds,millet,brown rice,buckwheat is that ok? thank You for any answes and guidance i really need it to get more confident"

0,msmofish,204,Hi All Is coconut water kefir safe on our diet ? I bought a bottle yesterday thats made w coconut water from raw young coconuts & probiotics etc please advise thanks Mo
0,HeatherJ,205,"So, friends and family have been on me for months to get “proper medical advice.” Evidently results aren’t enough to stop tongues from wagging. But, it is hard to take offense, as it all comes from a place of caring and concern-not judgement. So, after a long summer break, the local naturopath is back. He’s book until Halloween…so, it will be a while. But, he did suggest that I take colloidal silver with my probiotic. The internet is undecided on the merits of colloidal silver. Any opinions?? Thanks!"
1,SueSullivan,205,"I think it depends on your tolerance for unproven alternative remedies. If you’re willing to try something simply because it has testimonials, and you have the money to spend on it, you could give it a try. I cannot imagine that colloidial silver would strike your family as “proper medical advice,” though. Personally, I wouldn’t try it and I’d be wary of a naturopath who prescribed it. I want my alternative practitioners to be evidence-based. I can’t find any hard evidence, not one study that it works whatsoever, and I’d rather put my time and money into supplements/protocols that have some science behind them. http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/hi-ho-silver/"
2,HeatherJ,205,"Sue, Whoa…I live in a mid-sized village in The Netherlands and I am well aware that opinions of competency are relative. Medical care here is a far cry from what it is in America. Finding competent care for the simplest of problems is a challenge; for this issue an even greater one. He also suggested that I not bother with the coconut kefir…which I found troubling. My appointment is on Halloween…just trying to figure out what to do. Thanks for looking this up! That was super nice of you."
3,SueSullivan,205,"I keep thinking about going back to my naturopath to see if I’m really on the right path with this treatment, or if it could be tweaked to be more precisely effective for me, but I haven’t yet, because I don’t want him telling me that I should drop this supplement or that food from my diet. I guess I don’t have faith that he will handle this better than the diet and protocol will. I went to him originally because my medical doctor was ignoring my concerns and giving me patently crap advice. At least the naturopath listened to me and agreed that my symptoms were significant and related (this was back when I had adrenal exhaustion and various other endocrine disregulation.) I stopped going to him 2 years later because his supplements weren’t making an improvement in the latest iteration of dysfunction I was experiencing. (Interestingly, he indicated on my last visit that I was testing positive for some sort of pathogen, but didn’t mention candida and whatever he gave me did not improve my symptoms.) I eventually went to a more alternative medical doctor who ran a ton of tests and came up with the candida diagnosis via stool. Not that her advice was that much better — she advised me to eat paleo and take digestive enzymes and HCl tablet and Vit D. No talk of probiotics or antifungals, beyond a 3-day course of flucowhatzits. I figure, at this point in my 3 1/2 year journey, I am learning to treat myself and not look to someone else for my answers with this protocol. I love how it focuses on listening to your body, going slow and heeding the feedback that you get physically, emotionally and energetically. But I do understand feeling pressure from family. That’s why I don’t talk to mine much about what’s going on with me. (Well, my parents and sister and my in-laws. My husband is quite supportive.) Good luck with whatever you decide!"
4,HeatherJ,205,"Thanks! Personally, I’m with you. I’ve asked regular doctors and been to doctors who practiced both naturopathic and conventional medicine together. I’ve given them my list of symptoms only to be treated with condescension. I have gone the conventional route with zero success and-and worsening symptoms. I guess I would be considered attractive-doctors thought I had problems with the changes that age brings…and I can’t help but try to seem fine, so I never “looked” ill. When I explain to people that I tried my luck with American doctors (we moved here 2 years ago) they just don’t get it. Dutch people, from my experience, don’t trust their own authority. They have to have someone else validate everything…so, to friends and family, my measurable improvements are insignificant. Even my husband, who is now supportive, still needs to have everything verified. If I am sick from any die-off, he worries that I am doing the wrong thing. I want him to have peace of mind. And people can’t help but notice-I think bringing my own food to every gathering is the first clue. And I have lost so much weight, my eyes are brighter, my skin is clear…people ask. So, if I go to this guy, and he says everything in on track, people will nod their heads, accept it and tell me that I was smart to get a “real opinion.” I have zero intention of deviating much from what I am doing. BUT, not all supplements are available here that are recommended; Amazon won’t mail them directly and I don’t want to make friends mail me boxes of pills every few months. So, I go into this expecting a bit of alternative medicine mumbo jumbo-and maybe it isn’t all wrong. I am willing to learn something new… So, I don’t know if I will look to this guy to do more for me than I am doing for myself, but I am certainly open-minded to the possibility that he might be a good resource. And 3 1/3 years? Have you been on the diet that long? Sounds as if your naturopath was not helpful…that is too bad. It is difficult to find a candida “expert” who isn’t selling a book and/or a line of supplements. But congratulations on overcoming all of that and getting this far!"
5,SueSullivan,205,"It sounds like you’ve got a plan for being in control of your treatment and getting what you need from your naturopath and only that. Good for you!  No, I haven’t been treating candida for 3 1/2 years — that’s just when my health started to go wonky. Got a virus I couldn’t kick, was exhausted for months, recovered, got physically active again, had a big adrenal crash, was exhausted for months again, started addressing digestive issues, got that on track, but then started developing symptoms, in retrospect, of a candida infestation last fall. My ND did well with the adrenal support and had good advice for improving digestion, but he didn’t catch the candida, and that’s when I gave up on that approach and went for the lab tests that IDed it.  I started combating candida in late May with a prescription antifungal and some dietary changes and got on the strict diet in late July. Doing very well on it, as long as I don’t veer from it. Sometimes I feel so good I think I can start adding things back in but that hasn’t gone well so far. So patience is the word of the day, week, month and season. Good luck getting some useful supplements and reassurance for your extended family! Sue"
0,fragrantsound,206,I have systemic candida and every time I really go after it I get horrible symptoms that keep me from functioning. My question is how long will the die off symptoms last if I tough it out? I decided to up my nystatin dose to really go after it since I’m tired of having candida.
1,SueSullivan,206,"Are you supporting your liver and doing everything you can to help your body eliminate the waste products the dying candida are exuding? How long die-off lasts seems to vary wildly from person to person, probably depending on the severity of their infections and the inherent strength or weakness of their various organs and systems. You can do — and people here have done — serious damage to their bodies by pushing too hard too fast to eliminate candida. It’s a marathon and the goal should be to get through the six to 18 months with a minimum of liver damage and a maximum of energy at any given stage. Push the effort to kill the candida and you’ll fail at both those goals. It is possible to go slow, make steady progress and not have too bad of a time with die off. IMO, that should be the goal. fwiw, Sue"
2,fragrantsound,206,Thank you Sue. I am still way under the dose the doctor gave me the first time I had this. I should have said I was taking one nystatin pill per day and am going up to 10. The first time I was given nystatin (about 10 years ago) I took 8 4 times a day. I am seeing the doctor soon as well. I will read the link you provided.
3,CiproSucks,206,"Hi Fragrant, what did your doctor give you for the die off symptoms? If I take so much as two probiotics a day for two or three days, or two caprylic acid pills a day, I’ll have severe die off symptoms. And I have to be extra careful because my system is already compromised by Cipro poisoning. I’d love to learn how to better handle die off symptoms."
4,fragrantsound,206,It’s called Blue Heron from Integrative therapies. You can get it on Amazon but I usually get it from my doctor. I tried caprylic as well at first and had some pretty bad die off symptoms but that was before I was on the blue heron.
5,CiproSucks,206,"Thanks for the tip. Is it cheaper to get it by prescription? What are the active ingredients in Blue Heron? I’m surprised this is the first I’m hearing of this. Would you say it’s more effective than Molybednum or NAC, Candidate, etc? Are any of those even actually effective?"
6,fragrantsound,206,"It’s not a prescription, my doctor carries it at his officeand I pay 23.00 a bottle. It has flax, psyllium, rice bran, dried plum, fenugreek seed, slippery elm, triphala, spectra probiotic blend, marshmallow root extract, and papain (papaya enzyme). I have not tried candidate and when I asked my doctor about moybednum He suggested I try this first. I think there is a danger of taking too much molybednum. High levels are linked to gout."
7,bouncygal,206,i have stopped my antifungals for 4 days so my body has a chance to rid the toxins iv had a lot of die off and too much too fast can cause liver damage. so im doing sauna and exercise to help sweat it out before i continue the antifungals. xxx bouncy
0,bouncygal,207,"I have had super dry eyes every day for about a week and a half, also my eyes are really blood shot today, i never had dry eyes before the diet."
1,SueSullivan,207,"Dry eyes and puffiness around the eyes have been two of my bigger symptoms. They’ve improved for me lately and were at their worst when my candida was uncontrolled, so it stands to reason that it could be a die-off reaction."
0,cherokee,208,"Hi everyone I am new to this forum and boy am I glad that I found it. Loads of information here – so thank you to all of you. This is my second bout with candida and it is much more fierce than the first round. I thought I had beat it, only for it to rear it’s ugly head again. I read a book called “Flood Your Body With Oxygen” by Ed McCabe. Excellent info in the book. After I ordered some OxyFlush (which he talked about) and started taking it I started having a die-off within hours. One thing that’s good about the OxyFlush is that it liquifies all of the matter in your intestines (not diarrhea) so that you are able to expel rapidly. The book recommends staying on the protocol for 1-2 weeks. I am still in week 1 and will continue as long as I feel I am able. I will keep you all posted. I know that I should probably do a kidney flush so that I can get the bile moving. Keep you posted on that too. Anyway, in the book, “Flood Your Body With Oxygen” the author explains in detail that viruses and fungi cannot survive in an oxygen rich environment. I had heard about this years ago and read about a fellow who was able to beat AIDS using food grade hydrogen peroxide. I kind of blew it off thinking it was written by a looney. I also have done some extensive research regarding probiotics. I learned that the pills on the market are not nearly as effective as someone with Candida would need. I learned that fermenting vegetables and making cultured coconut water and cultured coconut milk (unflavored) is going to give me trillions of the good bacteria as opposed to the millions/billions that you might get on the market. AND it is much less expensive and actually fun to do. I need to find the Candida diet that I saw has been mentioned here. If someone could point me in the right direction I would be so grateful. I am sorry that you have this dreadful disease but I am grateful that I no longer have to go through this alone. Persevere my dears!"
1,bluegrasgrl,208,"I am definitely going to try what you suggested, I have been on the diet since March, tried all kinds of products and drs!! Nothing helps!! I did however start candex last week and I have felt better than I have in months. I am so wore out from trying so many different things only to feel worse not to mention the money this requires. Thank for your post, I have completed hours of research and I finally decided to start posting as well, hoping with our personal experiences we can all help each other since drs seem to ignore us!"
2,fragrantsound,208,"Cherokee, I have had problems with other medications that when the candida begins to die off my symptoms get much worse. Have you had this problem and how did that go with the oxyflush? I have Hoshimoto’s which has caused a lot of extra pain in my body. I can’t function with that much pain so I went off the meds and am attempting diet only."
3,thegreendiva,208,"Fascinating, I look forward to reading how you get on!"
4,fragrantsound,208,Oxyflush did not work for me. No different than the other magnesium I was already taking for regularity. I am now trying fivelac which worked for a friend.
5,Ruffian,208,I have heard just the opposite. Here is an article that says Candida grows significantly better WITH hydrogen peroxide: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC269762/pdf/jcm00038-0112.pdf I’d truly like to know which is correct because I have considered h2o2 before this.

0,Lenoirbeaute,210,"I’ve been reading this forum for the last 5 months but haven’t posted much so here goes 🙂 I first want to say thank you to all of you for all the amazing information and genuine care for one another. I’m 28 now and don’t really know when I contracted my candida infestation my symptoms started getting bad when I constantly got yeast infections and my allergies got worse every year. I would go to the gyno and be prescribed oral medication, creams, difflucan (fluzocane) etc… I would be told that I was wearing my pants too tight or that I was using the wrong laundry detergent I heard every reason under the sun except DIET. Within the past 3 years I have seriously started doing my own research on what exactly is wrong with me. I have always been lactose intolerant so I decided to go vegan. My bloating and sinus infections stopped. Then I went vegan and Gluten free lots of my symptoms subsided, I also started going to the bathroom at least once a day which I had NEVER done (my movements were always 3 to 5 days apart) However I developed MAJOR acne which has recently gone down in the last 8 months when I became a vegan gluten free raw foodist. Today I still get sever bloating (I never know when it’s coming or what exactly triggers it) dizziness, fatigue, muscle pain mood swings, no libido itchy skin the list goes on. I started your safe and proper cleanse in March for 10 days then went on to Able and Raster’s Strict diet. The fist couple moths were rough because I work full time and I am involved in physical movement theatre, I also dance and do aerial silk and hoop. There were times I was in tears because I didn’t have any strength or concentration to perform. after about 3 months on the diet and protocol the severe brain fog started to lift slightly but I was still getting stomach bloating and itchy skin I stopped getting my menstrual cycle after the first month and I had gone from 5’6 and 135lbs to 115 so I went to see a naturopath. I did some blood and saliva testing and found high cortisol levels at night and low T3. I started taking Amour Thyroid and pregnenolone my Estradiol, progesterone, Pg/E2 were all low. Which I figured they would be since hormonal imbalance is a symptom of candida. I started to gain weight after starting the hormones and I started having stronger carbohydrate and protein cravings. Within the last month I cheated with almonds, brown rice, quinoa, processed crackers and I had some cake at a party. I felt worse then ever so I decided to go back to the drawing board and start over. I have just completed day 4 of the gentle and safe cleanse and have a few questions. *I continued to take the hormone supplements during the cleanse with no problem my menstrual cycle still has not returned should I continue taking them? are they feeding candida? *Before the cleanse I had introduced coconut flour and buckwheat into my diet and I was doing well when I didn’t overeat. Can I introduce them or should I follow from the beginning to the T? I am asking because I need more energy somehow 😕 *should I wait the recommend time to start antifungals or can I start them right away since I was taking them before? I was using Raw virgin coconut oil and garlic pills I also went thru a bottle of SF722. *should I wait the recommend time to start taking my pro biotic again or introduce them right away? I was taking the Megaflora with DDS-1 that was recommended. Supplements I took during my 3 day cleanse: Moly Acid Chelate 250mcg Nettle Herb Vit C 100 mg Amour Thyroid Pregnenolone Supplements I plan on adding back into my regimen Ashwandaga 5-HTP Vitamin D3 I think that’s enough typing for now lol I’d like to keep this thread open as a means to report my progress. The one thing I regret not doing on my first attempt at this diet was not posting and asking for advice. thank you thank you thank you!!! -Noir"
1,raster,210,"You don’t have to start over and do the cleanse because the cleanse doesn’t kill that much of the candida. You just need to restrict your diet and maybe take some better supplements. You might need a different treatment plan than what your naturopath has decided and/or what the protocol provides. I talked to my naturopath about hormones and he does not use them whatsoever and thinks that there are some better alternatives. Its up to you on whether to use them or not, but they could be significantly affecting your treatment and I would look at this further. If you haven’t tried HMF neuro I would consider this as your next probiotic. Its the most effective one my opinion. I wouldn’t consume any supplements on the clenase other than liver protecting ones. The hormones are up to you on the cleanse, I don’t know much about them myself. -raster"
2,Jojilla,210,"Raster, I haven’t tried HMF neuro yet, and need to buy a new bottle of probiotics. Can you please post a link to the brand that you buy? I see that there are options such as powders, caps, FOS, NO FOS, etc… Thanks so much!"
3,Lenoirbeaute,210,Thanks for the reply Raster! I have been taking the hormones for a month and recently got my cycle back after posting this so I’m excited about that! I hope that they are not ruining my treatment :/ I’m planning on finding a different naturopath that knows more about candida. Thanks for the probiotic recommendation.
0,HeatherJ,211,"Okay, when I went to my health food store and bought my Probiotics, the very nice sales person translated the directions on the back of the bottle: dissolve caplets in water for 30 minutes and then drink. Today I was reading that many probiotics don’t work because the capsule doesn’t make it through digestion and all of the probiotica are destroyed. Does this mean that my bottle of capsules is ineffective? If anyone would be willing to give me a detailed list of supplements, including brand names, I would appreciate it. I can order them from Amazon and have them delivered to a friend who will mail them to me. Due to regulations, they can’t be mailed directly. As it is, I have no medical support. The local naturopath has been on summer vacation and is due back at the end of the month. I have an appointment for the middle of September with some guy who is going to analyze my hair strand… His site is in Dutch, but maybe someone might recognize the name: Rob Verheij. Here is his site: http://www.robverheij.nl/?content=robverheij Thanks."
1,bloom,211,"thanks for the link, I’ll bookmark that page to add to the others as I’m fascinated by this topic. I first heard about this here Ed Yong and from what little I know, supplements are all different dependent on a number of factors and that all are unable to reconolise the GI tract successfully so although some of the bacteria will make it through and you will benfit from those in the short term, not enough of them will make it to mean that anything sustainable will happen long term. Essentially as soon as you stop taking them any benefits will cease and I think that’s why the concept of Fecal Transplants is gaining a little momentum. I’ve just ordered a kit from Ubiome which will enable them to sequence my bacteria as part of a clinical trial they are currently doing on the microbiome. They will send you a summary of what/how many strains of bacteria make up your microbiome which you can then cross reference with others through their database. Dependant on the result from this I am considering the option of a Fecal Transplant to see if it helps with my IBS and/or CFS."

0,vitani88,213,"Hello, all! This is my first post here and I can’t believe I didn’t find this forum the first time I went on the diet in 2011! I have some questions regarding my diet and I think this is the best place for answers, from what I’ve seen. First, a little background. In late 2010 I began breaking out in terrible acne. I had acne in middle school which I was given multiple antibiotics and eventually accutane for, but this was the first breakout I’d had since the start of high school (I’m 25 now, so 22 when this all started). I was working in a military hospital so I went to the dermatologist next door who promptly prescribed antibiotics, which I took for a couple months with no success. I then saw a dermatologist upon moving back to my home state who suggested accutane again. I declined and eventually began seeing a holistic doctor who tested me for food allergies in what must have been August or September 2011. I found out I am allergic to the following foods: Bakers and brewers yeast were both off the charts, mild reactions to gluten and cottage cheese. It was also confirmed that I had an overgrowth of candida. She immediately put me on the candida diet and my symptoms were 95% clear within 6 months, at which time I began reintroducing foods (I was going on vacation and was intent on eating what I wanted). That was March 2012. Since that time, I’ve eaten basically everything I wanted with the exception of yeast. I ate all the sugar and gluten I wanted with no problems other than the occasional breakout – my skin has never been 100% clear since. About two weeks ago I started to break out again and I knew that I needed to catch it early, so I began another candida diet alongside a parasite cleanse. The last time I had a major candida overgrowth my holistic doctor also found parasites and said that the candida and the parasites had gone hand in hand. But now I have questions about my diet and the plan in general. These are the things I’ve been eating: Eggs Green peppers Almonds Almond butter Almond milk Coconut flour Unsweetened coconut Coconut oil Stevia Herbal tea Celery Mixed greens Lemon juice Chicken Pumpkin Zucchini Butternut squash Garlic Turkey Quinoa Earth balance fake “butter” Chocolate sweetened with stevia Occasional gluten free oats Occasional corn grits Are these foods all okay? My forehead has completely cleared since starting this last Wednesday, so I’m hopeful that it’ll be cleared completely soon. I’m throwing a birthday party for my husband next month and I’m having the cake I paid for regardless! Thanks!"

0,rushy_23,216,"Hi there, My name’s Rush and I am from the UK. Havent been diagnosed as such, but my symptoms point towards me having a bad case of Candida. I’ve been conscious of my stomach bloating for a year or so now, but its only the last say 4 months I’ve really suffered, feeling groggy, run down, bloated and constipated. I’ve started building my collection of supplements and I am slowly gearing towards my proper Candida diet (im struggling to deal with the the drop of calories so far per day). Anyhow, some supplements arrive today along with some Organic Chicory Coffee: http://www.goodnessdirect.co.uk/cgi-local/frameset/detail/651992_Prewitt_s_Organic_Instant_Chicory_Drink_100g.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=shop&utm_campaign=feed&gclid=CO6rvKiezbgCFTMctAodFWsAwA However reading the label within 100g serving it contains: 84.9g Carb’s of which 21.4g are sugar?! I suspect this is a definite no go. Especially as I am looking to start a 5 day detox soon followed by the strict diet? Secondly, I have already cut out beef/pork/carbs (sugars)/caffeine/milk/wholegrain (its been real tough!). I don’t know what to expect in terms of die off. One thing though, I’ve had an extremely bad sore throat and the pain in my left ear is horrendous (about 6 days now). When I initially eat something my left ear flares up then by the 3rd bite cools down. I have been taking Caprylic Acid/Organic Coconut Oil (not virgin) daily and have upped my intake of onion/garlic/ginger. Not sure if I just feel unwell or this is genuine die off symptoms. Thanks for your time, Rush"
1,eskimo_pup,216,"Hi, I just had a look at my jar of prewetts and you are correct on the numbers which i found shocking until i realized that is the sugar inside the WHOLE jar as it says ‘per 100g’. So in the scheme of things a teaspoon a time will probably bring it down to acceptable levels of sugar much like greek yoghurt can contain between 4-8g of sugar on the strict diet/protocol but the pros outweigh the cons because it is probiotic. I can’t be sure though. Your symptoms are pretty standard for me, sore throat, ear problems, mild sinus issues and sneezing. I get it worsening especially when i switch the probiotic brands or take my doses up, then it tends to stabilise but still not nice. Get your ears checked out by a GP, they keep giving me this sucky otomize spray which is an antibiotic and is rubbish but what can you do? I’m ordering a good chunk of my stuff from i herb as its massively cheaper then the uk, PM me if you want details on the customs and VAT limits and a 10% off code for your first order. The chelated molybdenum for example is about £4 from i herb and £10 in the uk last i checked. For some reason supplements are massively cheaper in America. I just spotted your coconut oil is not virgin, this will have zero benefits towards your treatment as processed oil doesn’t have the same strong antifungal benefits as virgin coconut oil. Before i switched to boulardii i was using ‘essential’ range from buywholefoodsonline.co.uk very cheap organic virgin oil if you buy the bulk box ."
2,shayfo,216,"Hey Rush! Welcome. You definitely need to get on some sort of supplement to reduce your die-off symptoms. As Eskimo Pup says, molybdenum amino acid chelate is a good one to get. You can also get milk thistle. I would stop taking antifungals until you’ve been on a die-off support product for a few days, since you’ll have die-off just from changing your diet. A lot of forum members are using the same protocol, which you can read here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Reading through it a few times will help you figure out what supplements to take, how much, when, etc. The protocol’s been created to be used in conjunction with a strict diet list developed by Able900 (the user who posted the protocol). Send him a PM asking for the strict diet and he can give you that. It’s a pretty strict list, but it takes the guesswork out of what to eat, and it eliminates foods that will feed the candida (if you keep feeding the candida, you’ll never get out of the cycle of die-off). Feel free to ask more questions."

5,rushy_23,216,"Many thanks, will have a good look on my next few days off work. I struggle through the day keeping to the low calorie intake. At home I will be able to just whack up a few nice dishes to somewhat tackle my hunger. I also (this may be a mistake at this point) eat a LOT of eggs throughout the day. I would say I consume around 10 a day (including the yokes), not sure what people’s thoughts are on this. At work I do 12 hour shifts and its so tempting to not avoid the vending machines full of junk food. I never ever used to eat junk food, but because my body is just craving anything, thats the most simple option. I was good last week, but I am at work today and have fallen to a packet of crisps. 🙁 I have with me 3 meals to last the working day but its just not enough. Will look into the hemp seeds. Did see some protein supplements made from hemp (but high in fibre). I consume a lot of olive oil (both neat and in my cooking). Considering its full of calories it doesnt give you that filled feeling which is what is screwing me over a little."

10,rushy_23,216,"Right guys so a small update in regards to progress. My die off symptoms have pretty much gone for now. Diet is going okay, Im sticking to steamed veg and swede mash potato (boiled then mashed with olive oil). And having organic eggs and sometimes organic chicken for protein. Even eating like this my stomach bloats up a lot by the end of the day, and my constipation at the point is usually fairly bad (not as bad as before I started this work). I also throw in spoons of coconut oil around meal time. Am doing my bentonite once a week, suppliments Molybdeum, milk thistle and ashwagandha. I dont really know how to feel. I always am always hungry and this hasnt got any easier. I crave junk food which I never craved before and being honest have opted for it on some days.. I find myself eating between 10 to 12 eggs a day sometimes, especially on a day if I am at work. I rely on the swede mash as a filler for my meals, and do wonder if this is the reason for my bloating up. The veg (steamed or olive oil stir fried) just does nothing for my hunger. Tiredness isnt too bad. Just wondering your thoughts?"

Swede, or rutabaga as it’s called in the US, contains one of the highest and strongest antifungals available, so the relatively small amount of sugar is completely negated by this fact. If it’s still early in your treatment and diet, be careful as far as the amount you eat the first few times, the die-off can be dreadful. Sean"

0,HeatherJ,219,"To start, I am an American who immigrated to The Netherlands almost two years ago. The Dutch don’t like to be too hard-core about anything. They tend to dislike extremes and prefer a middle of the road approach. And the Dutch, as a whole, tend to have really horrible doctors. So, you can imagine the response I get from people. I have had a few friends be very supportive. However, most of them roll their eyes and wonder if this is some sort of attempt at weight loss. They do not know how sick I have been, and I do not feel as if I should have to tell them just so that they can stop pressuring me to have one glass of rose’. “What harm can one glass do?” “Wow, this is an extreme thing you are doing. Have you called a doctor?” Worse, several friends have accused me of punishing myself. They say that I am doing this to myself …that I should just relax and have a sandwich. I have tried to explain that is like telling a diabetic to relax and have a dozen doughnuts. “So, you are diabetic?” How do people handle the stress-and anxiety-that comes when explaining this diet to friends and family?"
1,DaughterNature,219,"Heather, My dad says I have an eating disorder although his American diet seems less productive than my restrictive diet. My boyfriend’s family saw me go from eating deep dish pizza, cake, and fruits to eating vegetables and taking supplements only. I am now 4 weeks into the diet and can eat things like oat bran, kefir, and more filling foods to help me gain back weight and energy. Are you loosing a lot of weight? If your friends are simply commenting on your diet then their cultural biases should not be taking seriously. A sandwich won’t necessarily heal you and if healing and feeling better are your main concerns then the unprofessional, unrelated advice from your loved ones should be politely dismissed. For instance, my father has no idea how good I feel after starting this diet; my boyfriend’s family doesn’t understand that “popping pills” is supposed to relieve me of discomfort, embarrassment, and a myriad of other issues that plague my life. And who knows, if these people have bad lifestyle habits they may one day be asking you for advice… Do not let commentary take you off the path of healing; after several more months of dieting they may stop griping at you and perhaps–if you don’t cheat–they may respect your zeal and commitment. 🙂"
2,Floggi,219,"  I’ve lived in the Netherlands all my life, and I’m really glad we have such extremely good doctors. Well educated, honest, and open. For example, our doctors together took action about the once prevalent standard use of antibiotics against almost everything. Heck, antibiotics were even prescribed against the flu, which is a virus infection so antibiotics do not work at all! Despite patients uproar, resulting in some cases of severely beaten up doctors because the patient demanded to have antibiotics (or whatever other medication), doctors persisted in educating the masses, in being reluctant with antibiotics, psychofarmaca and other medication. Now we are by far the lowest consumers of antibiotics. We also have an extremely low number of teenage pregnancies. I’m really glad my doctor has good knowledge, listens to me, and decides upon the best approach in consultation with me. I’m not just a passive patient awaiting His Majesty’s Good Decision – instead, we decide together on whether I need treatment, and if so: which treatment.  "
3,HeatherJ,219,"Floggi-Do you have a doctor who you could recommend who is familiar with Candida? Nice to know that someone in this country has had a positive experience with doctors-you are honestly the first person I have heard (read) who has positive things to say about their doctor. While you are right in that they are slow to prescribe antibiotics, they are slow to suggest anything beyond paracetamol. But you are also right in that if you go in knowing what is already wrong with you, they will do as you ask. But it has been my experience that American doctors do the same thing. But in my perfect world, the doctor would have more of a diagnostic clue than me. LOL. Thank goodness for the internet!"
4,Floggi,219,"  I do not know which doctors would be familiar with candida. In general, all of my family and friends have positive experiences with doctors. The only negative stories I hear are about doctors not really listening to their patients, and starting to write some standard prescription before the patient has even finished telling their story. But even those cases are very rare now. Most doctors I have heard about listen to their patients, then try to find the best solution that fits that particular patient. They generally judge the level of expertise of the patient. If the patient seems to have no knowledge, the advise and explain what they prescribe. If the patient has lots of knowledge, they advise and explain too, but the patient can actively participate in the judging of the pros and cons of several alternatives. That’s what generally happens when I visit my doctor. Of course, the doctor expects from me that I do listen to him too. I cannot just walk in, say “hey doc, this is my diagnosis, I have found a suitable cure, so please prescribe that to me, will you!”, and expect the doctor to comply. Once when I visited my doctor with skin problems, the doctor told me honestly that he couldn’t determine the cause. He then explained that he could have my skin tested, but these tests are very expensive, and they take lots of time, which would only delay the starting of my treatment. So he proposed to just prescribe me some ointment that has been effective in about 80% of similar cases. I would try the ointment, and if it worked then fine, if not I would have to come back in a week. The ointment didn’t help me: I belonged to the other 20%. So I returned. My doctor then asked me how much of a problem my irritation was, because the next step would depend on that. As it was only mildly irritating, he proposed to try a second ointment now, and a third one if the second one wouldn’t work either, and only go into extensive skin testing if the third one would fail too. If my problems would have been more severe, he would have sent me into the extensive testing immediately. So together (!) we decided to try the second ointment. To make a long story short, the second one had only a small effect on my skin irritation. The third ointment finally solved the problem. It was a long route, but my doctor and I decided on this together, so this was fine. I really like my doctor for listening to me like that! If I now visit my doctor, I always tell him that I do not want to receive any treatment at all if he thinks my complaints will disappear by themselves. My doctor agrees with that. Of course many times I have no idea what causes my complaints. My doctor does know – well, most of the time, and if he doesn’t, he isn’t afraid to admit that. He isn’t afraid either to look things up if I turn out to have something rare. Once he asked me to leave and to phone him in two days, so he could consult with another doctor who had more knowledge about a particular set of diseases. I really like that attitude: no-one has perfect knowledge, and my doctor is perfectly aware that this applies to him too, and he acts accordingly. That’s what I consider a real expert.  "
5,raster,219,I recommend educating yourself more about candida and then you will be able to share the information you have learned. A great place to start out is by listening to dr. mcoomb’s radio shows: http://www.candidaplan.com/new/media_center/ -raster

0,DaughterNature,221,"Here is some information on Kefir Grains. I presented this information at a workshop at my local farmer’s market. Anyone who as something to add is welcome! Kefir Milk Grains What? Milk kefir grains have a texture similar to that of cottage cheese. They feed off lactose in milk from cows, goats, sheep, coconut or soy. The grains consist of beneficial yeast and bacteria that live in harmony with one another. How? To begin, place kefir grains in a clean glass jar with about 10 times as much milk as you have grains. Cover the jar with a material that permits airflow but does not allow bugs to get in. This can be a paper towel, clean hair net, or an unused coffee filter. Lastly secure the cloth top with a rubber band. Store the fermenting kefir grains and their fresh batch of milk on a counter top and out of direct sunlight. The temperature should be between 75-78˚F. Let the process occur for at least 24 hours. If the room temperature is higher than 78˚F then the kefir will take less time to culture. If the room is cooler than 75˚F then the kefir will take longer than 24 hours to culture. To strain the fermented kefir milk, remove the top and pour the milk into a strainer. This utensil should allow the milky liquid to poor through while capturing the kefir grains. Place the grains back in a glass jar with fresh milk and repeat the process again for another 24 hours. Store the strained kefir milk in the refrigerator and use it within a week for best results. When? Kefir can be produced year-round in your own kitchen. Just like any other food, kefir should be eaten in small amounts to start. Start with 4-ounce servings. Once you feel comfortable, you can indulge in larger amounts. Where? Kefir grains are originally from the Caucasus Mountains between Russia and Georgia. These grains should never need to be repurchased, lasting indefinitely as long as they receive their daily supply of lactose milk. Kefir grains can culture in coconut milk and some nut milks. However, the grains should experience a monthly “maintenance feed” of cow or goat milk. This means that if you do not plan on using animal milk regularly then you should ensure the health of your grains by feeding them animal milk at least once a month or else the grains can die slowly. Who? People who feel discomfort due to an inner imbalance can benefit from drinking kefir milk. Constipation, yeast infection, chronic fatigue, and irritable bowl syndrome are just a few afflictions that can be remedied with the help of kefir consumption accompanied with a wholesome diet of natural foods. Antibiotics and birth control pills are two examples of prescription medications that tend to throw the body’s inner ecosystem out of whack by allowing the harmful gut flora to prosper. A common example of a bodily reaction is a yeast infection. Regular doses of kefir naturally helps controls the imbalance by keeping harmful yeasts in check. Why? Kefir is full of the healthy bacteria that inhabit the digestive tract and live in symbiosis with your digestive system. Kefir is surprisingly easy to digest. The grains use the lactose in milk to produce their food. The amount of lactose left in the fermented milk after 24 hours is significantly lower. As a result, the milk settles well even on an empty stomach! Interested in buying kefir? Beware of companies who wish to sell you products that do not reproduce grains. The only two investments in kefir should be the initial cost of pure grains and the price of milk to continue feeding them. What do I do when I produce too much kefir for myself? Kefir grains multiply over time, and you may find that you have a surplus. Some people enjoy making cheese with the kefir. The grains themselves can be eaten for an even higher concentration of probiotics. http://www.kefir.net/ http://www.kefirlady.com/"
1,Donna V,221,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE my kefir cheese! I use an immersion or stick blender to mix flax oil with it.

Yummy stuff!"
2,fireman22,221,I noticed in the body ecology starter kit it said to warm the milk to about 90 degrees…do you have to do this? Or can you just put the milk in a glass jar while its still cold? thanks
3,DaughterNature,221,I put my grains in cold milk (just out of the refrigerator) all the time. The milk will warm to room temperature and the grains will create kefir just fine this way.
4,SueSullivan,221,"Thank you for this post. I’m pretty intimidated by the idea of milk kefir but would like to try it. Do you mail order grains then from the sites you linked to? I think I’ve seen them for sale in Whole Foods, and I suppose I could also ask local friends if they have any. I know I have friends who do water kefir, could the same grains be used for milk kefir? Would it be safe to do milk kefir with raw milk? We get raw milk from a dairy that tests every batch each week, so I know it’s clean but I’m leery of letting it sit out on the counter. Thanks in advance, Sue"
5,DaughterNature,221,"Yes, the fermentation process is daunting from a far. However, now I love this as a hobby. I am currently making kefir cream cheese in my kitchen. It is AMAZING! I do not use water kefir grains in milk kefir. I purchased my original grains from a person advertising on craigslist.com a couple years ago. Luckily, this woman took care of her grains and they were of good quality. kefir.net can teach you a lot but for purchases I would go to the Kefir Lady’s site. I am so envious that you have access to quality raw milk. I have used raw goat’s milk to make kefir. It is supposed to be better for the stomach than cow’s milk. Don’t worry about letting the milk sit out. Room temperature is ideal for the grains to be “healthy”. The grains do a great job of preserving the milk so that no rotting occurs. My crazy scientist boyfriend tests the limits of kefir frequently. Rest assured that the beneficial bacteria thrive in non-refridgerated environments. 🙂"

8,DaughterNature,221,I followed the diet and protocol so I added kefir after three weeks. I would have added kefir after two weeks but my die-off was so bad that I waited. Many forum members say that kefir is an essential part of the cure so I’m glad you know how to make your own. Have you tried double-fermenting the kefir (secondary fermentation under airlock)? Supposedly this method makes the vitamins more bio-availble. I embedded a link with the process and more information above. 🙂
9,Jojilla,221,"Does anyone know how much kefir is recommended on the strict diet? I drink 1 cup in the morning on an empty stomach and another cup prior to going to bed (not quite as empty of a stomach, but I try). I love kefir so much. It’s my favorite “treat” on this diet. My favorite way to eat it is to put a couple tablespoons of Qi’a cereal (http://us.naturespath.com/qia) (the only ingredients are buckwheat groats, hemp seeds, and chia seeds) into a cup of kefir in the evening before bed and have it in the morning because the chia seeds create a decently thick, creamy, cold pudding to eat in the morning! Thanks for helping us out with kefir, DaughterNature!"
10,DaughterNature,221,"Hello, Jojilla. I don’t know that there is a specific amount of kefir consumption recommended on the diet. 1 cup in the morning and at night is great! I’ve gone up to 2 cups in the morning and at night making sure to consume enough water, too."
11,Jojilla,221,"I have a few more kefir questions. I’m new to making kefir. I’m making goat kefir (well, really, not yet, I’m in my first week of rehydrating milk grains from Cultures for Health). This week I’ve been feeding my grains, daily, one cup of pasteurized milk. And each day it smells better, but isn’t getting kefir thick yet. Cultures for Health said it could take from 4 days to 2 weeks for my grains to be fully active. Do you have any thoughts on this DaughterNature? I’ve been doing this for 5 days now. I’ve been storing my kefir in the cupboard above the refrigerator, but I’m wondering if it’s not so good that I leave it in an enclosed cupboard? It’s probably about 72-74 degrees up there. Thanks for your advice! Also, just last night, I decided to try a second ferment with the cup of milk from the previous day. I don’t know that it will work given I’m not really making kefir yet. But I have to say, it’s starting to smell like kefir—it’s a nice fresh, kefir smell each day—-just not thick at all."
12,DaughterNature,221,"Hi Jojilla, Below I am posting a link to a website that clearly explains the process of reactivating dried milk kefir grains. However, it seems like you’re doing things correctly; the temperature seems ideal; an enclosed cupboard is a good location. What is the texture of your grains at this time?

13,Jojilla,221,"I watched the video, and my kefir isn’t what as thick as theirs was at 4 days. My grains are starting to grow a bit and to become a bit softer, though some are still hard.

It’s probably about 72-74 degrees up there. Based on this statement it seems that your environment isn’t far from ideal. Are you using fat free, low-fat, or whole milk? Also, when I used raw goat milk the kefir tended to separate and formed a very liquid milk (instead of thicker texture made from most cow’s milk). You can try giving the fermenting grains a swirl or a stir (with a clean wooden spoon) every few hours to allow them more direct contact with the milk after slight separation. If your grains are softening and becoming larger then they should be waking up. Perhaps you should wait a few more days and update me on their state."
0,HeatherJ,222,I can expect to go through another year and a half of periods without chocolate???!!! Seriously? I don’t think I thought this through clearly. Suggestions?
1,kjones02,222,"It gets easier. Actually, I don’t even remember the last time I had chocolate. I don’t crave it like last year. I never ate a big portion of it before, but I always wanted to having a hershey kiss or something after a meal. Now, no big deal. In fact, I would rather have some of my approved candida-friendly treats I try to make now. I think once you get more into the diet and become more stable, you can test a small amount of carob, but don’t quote me. I forget how Able or raster feel about that."
2,SueSullivan,222,"Progesterone supplementation in the last two weeks of your cycle. It’s reduced my PMS symptoms significantly. I got a prescription through an alernative-ish medical clinic and take 50 mg at night. You can also try progesterone cream at the health food store but it’s harder to get a significantly sized dose. You apply it to the thinnest skin on your body (inside of the forearms and thights, lower belly). The candida messes with our hormone balance and you’re likely estrogen dominant (even if we didn’t have candida, the phytoestrogens and other sources of hormone mimicking chemicals in daily life will throw us off as well.) fwiw, Sue"
3,Jojilla,222,"While we are on this topic, on my first month on the Strict Diet, my period was late by a week or two, and now this month, it still hasn’t shown up. Would there be a reason that I wouldn’t get my period because of this diet or any of the supplements I am taking?"
0,JVNIXON,223,"I’m on the candida diet but of course the veg I eat (mushrooms, corn, potato, bean sprouts) are the ones I can’t eat! I want to eat veg but I’m one of those few people (super tasters) with high bitter receptors! 🙁 I’m trying I sat and ate a load of asparagus this morning. It was ok-ish but I went “blehhhh” one they hit the back receptors as I tried to swallow.  I then attempted green peppers, celery and avocado before my fashion show but I tasted them immediately and struggle with the textures a little! I’m fed up with people telling me veg are so yummy! But honestly to me toxic water is an accurate description! And on this stupid diet I can’t even mask them with sauce/ actually flavoursome dressings to mask the bitterness to get used to them! 🙁 I’m just lost at what to do! I don’t know how to make myself like them! I’m trying all different things today but now it’s dinner time I’m starving and can’t face the idea of more 🙁  Seriously I’d consider hypnotism at this stage if I thought it would work lol"

Some things I like are curry, garlic, and pesto (easy to make your own with basil, garlic, olive oil). I don’t know if those will set off your supertaste or not. You might just have to learn to like them. Oh, also, blended zucchini soup, to me anyway, tastes like corn soup."

5,SueSullivan,223,"You’re trying to eat some difficult, strong tasting vegetables — they’re one’s I can’t tolerate either. Start with the easier, blander vegetables and try blending them up into a creamy soup as well. Zucchini and onions stir fry beautifully with a squeeze of lemon and sea salt and pepper. I love them with sauteed chicken. I also like them well enough in a frittata (just blend up an egg or two and pour over them once they’ve sauteed a bit. And a spinach omelet is a quick and easy way to get some greens in. I top that with avocado to replace cheese. If green beans are a bit tough for you, texture wise, blend them up in a Bieler soup (search for it on this site, AlexAlegbra posted a good recipe). Try roasting kale chips and rutabega chips. Get fresh kale, tear the leaves off the thicker stems in oh, egg-sized pieces, and toss them with olive oil, rubbing each leaf to be sure it gets coated. Spread them out on a cookie sheet and sprinkle *lightly* but thoroughly with sea salt then cook at 300 degrees. If they’re too thickly spread on the pan, you may need to stir them once or twice during cooking. When they are crispy (if textures are an issue for you, let them get completely crispy, they’ll start to brown a bit) they’re done. Rutabegas are a PITA to slice, so sharpen your knife and be very careful, but carefully slice them as thin as you can (I will sometimes use a vegetable peeler and just try to get as thick a peeled slice as I can, but they dry up to almost nothing when they’re that thin). Coat them again in olive oil and lightly sea salt them and roast them at about 350 degrees, turning once or twice. Check frequently as their sugar content makes them prone to burning quickly. Again, if textures bother you, cook them just shy of overcooked. They are yummy! Swap up your salads — baby arugula, baby lettuces, the younger the leaf the sweeter and easier it is to eat. Top with hemp seeds, sliced hard boiled eggs, avocados. These are my go-to veggie choices when I’m not feeling up to the challenge of stronger flavors. You’ll be able to tolerate more complex veggies after a while. good luck, Sue"

0,HeatherJ,224,"My family doesn’t have Candida. They don’t want to try my diet-even one day a week. But I still have the responsibility of cooking for them. They still want baked goods and don’t want to change much of what they eat. They are willing to settle with having goodies less often, but not with giving them up. I have small ways to cope with the worst of it-the baked goods: -I bake cookies and store most of them in the freezer; only putting a few in the cookie jar. -We have a second fridge in the garage-where I will store any cakes I bake  -I refuse to make chocolate cake because I wouldn’t be able to resist. But how do you all deal with the day to day stuff? Last night I made Pasta, sauce and cooked baguettes. YUM! I just went away until they finished eating. If I am not around, my husband will clean-up. If not, it just depends. But I don’t want to miss every meal with my family. Suggestions?"
1,beccana14,224,"I know what you mean. It really stinks to have to cook for others not on the diet. My husband is great and supportive but has mentioned a few times that our fridge and pantries aren”t filled with as many “good” foods these days. Do you cook vegetables with the family meals? I always have SOMETHING along with the meals that I can sit down and enjoy with the family. Even if it’s just steamed broccoli. Also, be sure you prepare little “treats” ahead of time for yourself along with the cookies you make for them. Like candida friendly granola or (my personal favorite) coconut milk icecream. Yum!!! To your health! Rebecca"
2,lita11,224,The whole family should have to discuss on that matter for candida cure and try to make vegetables more an more.
3,SueSullivan,224,"A couple of ideas: Make a list of all the dishes your family likes to eat, ask them to contribute suggestions as well. Rank them in order of how much they appeal to you as well, and only cook from the bottom 50 percent of the list. If there’s something they crave that you love as well, send them out to eat it as a special treat for them. Take a hot bath or do something that feels indulgent for yourself while they are gone. Always cook for yourself first. I’ve found this means I spend better than half the day cooking or cleaning up from cooking, which is a drag (but I’m fortunate as a stay at home mom to be able to do that). I set up a computer with Netflix in the kitchen and stream shows while I cook and clean. It is much easier to cook for my family after I’ve had something satisfying to eat. Buy good quality prepared foods for them — I’ll got to whole foods and pick up some frozen foods that have quality ingredients so that I don’t have to do as much scratch cooking right now. It’s a splurge, and generally not as healthy as if I was cooking for them, but if they aren’t willing to make the sacrifice of eating with you or cooking for themselves, I think it’s a reasonable solution. Costco has some great prepared foods as well, if you have that option. Consider that expense an investment in your health, and consider that it will be cheaper than sending them out to a restaurant. Make crockpot meals and casseroles — I find that dishes I can assemble from raw ingredients and walk away from for the remainder of the cooking time are less tempting. Instead of baguettes, which are really time consuming, make no-knead bread for them. It will still smell incredible when you pull it out, but you will have spent all of five minutes on it and will be more willing to give it away without needing to try it. http://www.steamykitchen.com/168-no-knead-bread-revisited.html Look for more recipes like this one below, that you can tweak to the diet (in this case I’d food-process up plain coconut shreds into a meal-y texture and replace the almond meal with that) that will still appeal to your family. There are a lot of paleo recipe sites on the web for inspiration: http://www.thepaleomom.com/2012/01/recipe-paleo-chicken-fingers.html good luck! Sue"

0,DaughterNature,235,"I have been on the strict diet for 3 days and have ordered the Protocol’s required supplements so I am not currently taking anything except a multivitamin and kefir. I have no problems other than diarrhea and feeling weak. For about 2 months now I have been experiencing small, soft stool that I cannot quite call diarrhea until a few days ago. The first day on the diet yielded good results: finger-sized, firmer stool and no die-off symptoms. For the last couple weeks I have been experiencing stool with undigested food in it (quinoa, sprouts, cucumber seeds, etc). This morning I had leftover spinach sauté with herb-only spicy cumin seasoning. About 3 hours later I had unpredictable, relentless diarrhea consisting of water and undigested food. That’s it. I drank a cup of homemade cow’s milk kefir from organic, pasturized milk. I have chewed my food well and eaten slow. Today I mixed 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar with 1/3 cup water before lunch (brussels sprouts, bell peppers, zucchini, red onion, basil, oregano, and other spices sautéed in avocado oil before adding raw garlic, salt, and pepper and then one egg) so I could digest better. I also drink lots of water. I know I am healing because until I started the strict diet I had a lot of anal itching every time I defecated. Now I feel no discomfort—my stool is simply watery greens… I am afraid to add more oils as I think this will not rid me of diarrhea. I hear raspberry or blackberry leaf tea relieves diarrhea. Are there any foods on the diet that can help me? Any other thoughts or suggestions? Extra info: My diet during the last few days: 2-3 eggs a day, hemp hearts infrequently, varied amounts of broccoli, cucumbers, bell pepper, small amount of spinach (which I will take out because I cannot digest it), okra, brussels sprouts, mineral water (by Optimally Organic), infrequent herb teas, lemon water, salt, pepper, raw garlic, raw chives, raw onions, cooked onions, and herbs from my garden, well washed. I also lost 6 pounds in three days bringing me down to 109 lbs. ☹ I used to eat A LOT but now I have a small appetite."
1,DaughterNature,235,"After going through my previous posts I saw this helpful information that raster posted: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would consider finishing your bottle of multivitamins and then stop and move on to getting individual vitamins. For instance, biotin is pretty important for the diet and its not easy to get this in your diet…same goes with vitamin C. There are a lot of vitamins that necessary to get better. For instance, if you have leaky gut, the best way to reduce the inflammation is to take anti-inflammatory supplements such as fermented cod liver oil (or regular). This is way more strong than almost all food grade sources. Additionally, sf722 which is a fatty acid, is one of the best long term antifungals to have on the diet and is quite effective. Enzymes or digestive bitters help break down the foods you eat and these are quite important for healing the gut and improving the digestion. A good probiotic is also very essential to get better because it’ll contain strains that aren’t found in the kefir (we have a probiotics post on the sticky tab). Most candida sufferers are deficient in stomach acid and taking betaine HCL helps break down the food you eat, and destroys pathogens/parasites in the gut, etc. creating a better environment for digestion. These basically are the most essential supplements and its hard to replace them with food grade sources. One thing I know about cactus is that its good for the heart, but I haven’t heard about its other healing properties. Also, for me, spinach is hard to digest so if this is coming up undigested in the stool, you might want to avoid it. -raster ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I guess I will wait until I start taking the many supplements I ordered. Hopefully I see improvement."
2,Able900,235,"At the time you wrote your first post, you said you were three days into the diet, but you also said you were having kefir which according to the instructions on the diet you shouldn’t start for two more weeks as it acts as an antifungal. You’re also eating garlic and Brussels sprouts, all of which are strong antifungals. I suggest you stop eating/drinking all three of these for another two weeks. At that time, introduce only one of these and in one week another, and wait another week to introduce the third. If you remain on the strict diet, you’ll still be killing the Candida. In your case you’re just going to have to take it slower. I also agree with Raster that you should not take a multiple vitamin. It sounds like you need to read The Protocol which accompanies the strict diet. Diarrhea will keep the die-off toxins out of your body which is good, but you don’t want it to go severely on every day. Since you apparently need to go slow with the treatment, don’t start the SF722 until much later. Stay in touch with us as far as the details of what you’re taking and eating as well as any problems that may pop up. Able"
3,DaughterNature,235,"Hello Able, I had the kefir once yesterday to hopefully tame the diarrhea and have been ingesting significant amounts of brussels sprouts and garlic because I have not received any die-off reactions that I experienced with these food in the past (bloating, gas, etc.). I have read the protocol many times over. I will take your advice and not eat any more of these items (I will feel pretty stupid if the antifungals are the reason for my problem). Raster advised to finish the multi-vitamin I was currently taking. I would have stopped but during day two I started feeling extremely weak. I feel a lot better now and will eliminate the multivitamin I take. Questions for you: 1. Should I start taking all supplements that do not have a specified start date on the Vitamins, Herbs & other Supplements page (http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1173_Vitamins-Minerals-Herbs.aspx) as soon as I receive them? 2. How long should I take the cal/mag/zinc, vitamin E, and vitamin C supplement, and yucca tea? I would love to send you the different things I’ve purchased (all on the Protocol) with suggestions. Should I start another topic to do so? I’m extremely happy you responded! You and your advice are my life force right now 🙂"
4,DaughterNature,235,"Hi there, Able. I am on day 13 and wondering when I should start the SF722. Currently I am feeling better than I was and following the timeline strictly. My stool has hardened for the most part and the only negative change I see is acne on my face. I never get acne… What was once a very loud ringing in my ears has dulled down so much that I focus much easier–I didn’t realize how lovely and quiet normal people’s lives are! I have been consuming more coconut oil each day (I’m up to 5 tablespoons throughout the day) and since week 1 is over I eat between 4 and 6 eggs each day. Is that too much? I eat at least 5 different vegetables, raw (if not gas-causing) and cooked throughout the day. I also want to introduce rutabaga as my first test food. Please give me the heads up on what you recommend. I do not want to jump into anything that may cause terrible die-off symptoms–I plan on being in public quite a bit during the next month. Supplements I take currently (all in recommended amounts and times by the protocol): -Molybdenum -Nettle Leaf Tea -Licorice Tea -cal/mag/zinc -betaine HCI -Vitamins A, D, and D3 after an oily breakfast and Cod liver oil after lunch -Vit E -Vit C -Milk Thistle Seed Caps and Tea -Yucca -Swedish Bitters -Lemon water -Diatomaceous Earth (not on protocol but I would love your second opinion on dosage) I am waiting to add: -Kefir -Probiotics (brands recommended by the protocol) -SF722 -Antifungals (first GSE for a week ONLY, then red thyme oil, then oregano oil, then alternate thyme and oregano oils) -Biotin -Lactoferrin Based on my situation please let me know if you continue to think I should wait to take the SF722 and how you feel about me introducing other new things.

5,Able900,235,"Based on my situation please let me know if you continue to think I should wait to take the SF722 and how you feel about me introducing other new things. I want to start eating unsweetened coconut shreds, too. It looks like you’ve only been on the diet for about 12 days. I still think you should take it very slowly because of the problem with diarrhea which you’ve experienced in the past.  Remember that the diet itself will continue to work as an antifungal, this means that it will continue to kill the Candida. This is especially true since you’re eating Brussels sprouts, garlic, and coconut oil; all of these act as antifungals along with the diet. This all means that I don’t think you should start the SF722 yet but just allow things to progress as they will on your present regimen. There’s no reason not to start eating the coconut shreds whenever you wish; just start with a very small amount. At the two week mark on the diet, start the supplements (vitamins only) one at a time leaving four days between each one. This will allow you to be aware if anything is upsetting your digestion and exactly what it is. As far as the doses and when to take them is concerned, this is all in the Vitamims & Minerals section of the protocol. It doesn’t really matter which supplement you start with. Able"

I live in Canada, I too have a GP that will order what ever I ask, however no western doctor will order a yeast blood panel unless you present severe systemic candida symptoms. This is unfortunate because I took this route of having to get extensive food allergy/sensitivity testing done to which my Naturopath suggested to get Candida testing done. It is not that expensive, if you have insurance its quite affordable. But don’t be disappointed if he doesn’t order it, these tests are performed when a patient needs hospitalization with systemic infections. The two main blood tests are Candida Immune Complex & IgM IgG IgA ELISA, I had the latter, but testing is quite difficult to analyze because everybody has yeast in their bodies so false positives and negatives happen all the time. I would ask him to test for hydrogen breath test for Lactose, and get Food Allergy Testing done IgE, major contributor to leaky gut & skin rashes. You get five free classes of food per year with MSP. Ask to check TSH Free T3 Free T4. Testing for Leaky Gut from the GP The Intestinal Permeability Test, also called the Lactulose and Mannitol Test, measures the ability of two sugar molecules, mannitol and lactulose to permeate the intestinal lining."

It wasn’t until I saw a physician that specialized in infectious diseases was I finally told that It Wasn’t All In My Head, it was in my blood.

2,many sparrows,241,"Hi, I believe that a substance in egg white called avidin kills off/inhibits biotin in the body, which is something which itself inhibits candida from changing to its mycelial form.

I’ve found it quite difficult to do, but am persisting with it because when it worked the result was amazing!

But on your stricter version of the diet, you say that virgin coconut oil, which has anti-fungal properties “should be taken throughout the entire treatment”. When is the correct time to take this?

1,many sparrows,254,"Hi,  In my experience, being over-emotional is definitely sometimes part of the die-off, and it really helps to remember that, altho’ not easy when the emotions are so powerful. Also, I’ve found that its tough for my husband too,who has his own emotional reactions to my diet and all the info that it involves. Its easy to think he should understand how obvious it is to see that candida makes me crave sugar for example, but gradually I’ve learnt that he is only learning this stuff through MY experience and MY beliefs about that experience; he is only learning about it secondhand from me and sometimes its totally overwhelming for him to work out what is real. Recently I realised that a good balance is this:to ask him to believe what I tell him about my EXPERIENCE, whilst still respecting his freedom to be agnostic(or questioning) about my BELIEFS about my experience. Another thing I’ve learnt is to say is’Look ,this stuff has not been massively researched or definitively proven, but I’m convinced (because of x,y, z) that its worth me pursuing it, and I’d really like you to support me as much as you can, even though you’re not sure about it.’ I’ve spent years thinking I’ve got to convince people that all this candida stuff really is real,and gradually some people have started to see for themselves, but its often only when they experience something themselves which makes them sit up and take notice. IME, people tend to think that all this health stuff is a bit weird,UNTIL they have some problem themselves and discover that the remedy is one of these ‘weird’ healthfoods Suddenly, overnight,something shifts for them and they START to see things afresh.

I even bloat after a basic leafy green salad (not everytime though). I get mild headaches most days, but it doesn’t bother me too much. All these things are new to my life i didn’t expirence all this before the diet (except for bloating but no way near as often ) On the up side during the day my tounge looks very pink with only the slightest hint of white right at the very back. Sooooo wondering if die off happens so early in the diet."

0,fixme,259,"I haven’t been on this site or awhile and have not been following the diet or protocol at all, in other words I am struggling with tongue thrush (and systemically). I’m really worried when it comes to dating and kissing. I have a tongue scraper and probiotic capsules. I can sprinkle the capsule and leave it on for like 20 minutes, then scrape most of of the crap off.. although some will still remain. I’m scared the person who I soon will kiss/make out with will be grossed out with me. I want to take care of the candida issue in the near future, but not now. What are your opinions if I try to scrape most of it off, kiss, and then tell him later on (months) what I’m dealing with, while trying to keep my tongue as clean as possible? Does anyone know from experience if someone can taste your thrush, even traces of it? I’d hate to bring up this embarrassing issue upfront with someone. Surely he’ll be turned off. At the same time, I don’t want to be deceiving. Any help appreciated. I’m worried. I’d hate to be more held back in life by this."
1,shayfo,259,"I fairly recently spent a night with a guy who I strooonnnngly suspect has thrush (and who gave it to me, hooray), and I didn’t notice when I kissed him, but it was noticeable the next morning. Like, morning-thrush-breath is a thing, I think. When I got thrush from him, I noticed it on myself a little bit first thing in the morning. Fortunately, mine has pretty much subsided (a month later), but I was otherwise symptom-free when I got it. It’s also probably responsible to keep in mind that you can pass thrush along to someone with whom you’re in intimate contact. I don’t think that would cause someone to have a system-wide candida overgrowth, but it doesn’t help. I got laryngitis from that guy mentioned above when I got thrush from him. A win all around :p"

4,fixme,259,"Thank you a lot for your input. I’m going to go to the doctor and hopefully get a prescription to get this covered for the time being, so I won’t have to worry about kissing. I wonder how fast the lozenges work (same day)? Anyone know? Anybody else have experience on this?"

0,Maxtoobad,261,"A couple of days ago I had some kefir and my reactions seemed to similar to me eating stuff with sugar in it and my allergies seemed to be active. I was only letting it sit for about 12-18 hours or so. It tasted better, but I wasn’t feeling good afterwards. I decided to let it sit out for 48 hours so the lactose (which is a disaccharide sugar) would be close to zero. I would mix it up every so often, which seemed to really alter it’s consistency along with making it very acidic tasting. It didn’t taste as yeasty either. I almost felt a buzz off drinking about a pint or so of it. Anyhow, this batch made me actually feel good after drinking it with no reactions at all. It doesn’t taste as good since there isn’t any lactose in it, but it’s super powerful stuff, and I feel very energetic after drinking it. Definitely not placebo. All the other batches that I’ve made previously smelt like yeast, almost like bakers yeast. This batch smelt almost like cow shit or a horse barn, but not in an alarming kind of way. I think letting it sit longer also reduces the yeast because all the level of acid in it letting it sit longer. From my understanding yeast cannot thrive in acidic environments–they like it more alkaline. That’s why I think I got sick in the first place most likely; I was on antibiotics and taking shit tons of tums making my stomach/intestines really alkaline. I’ll keep you posted."
1,DaughterNature,261,"Hey Max, I am glad you are so positive about making kefir. I enjoy watching the grains grow and multiply. You mentioned consuming “about a pint”. If you are newly introducing kefir to your diet you should consider taking a few tablespoons each day and gradually increasing the amount. Kefir acts as an antifungal and can cause discomfort as a result. If you’re taking Molybdenum, then that should aid your organs as you experience die-off symptoms. Certain herbs can also protect your body as the candida dwindles. Enjoy your “kefies”!"
0,DaughterNature,262,"Hello, I know Able’s dieting strategy calls for molybdenum (to protect agains the harmful die-off effects) for three days before commencing the diet/cleanse and protocol. My molybdenum is taking a long time to arrive and I have already started eating the strict diet (eliminating garlic, brussels sprouts, rutabaga, etc. to prevent strong die-off symptoms). I am on day 4 now! Questions: 1. MUST I count “day 1” as the day I start taking molybdenum or can I simple start the supplement when it arrives (within two days) and call that day 5 (or 6)? 2. Will whole food anti-fungals disturb the good bacteria in my stomach? After, say, 3 months should I not be eating rutabaga in order to allow the good bacteria to populate in my gut? I know anti-fungal oils (oregano, red thyme, etc.) should be eliminated when die-off symptoms diminish. 3. Able, how long have you been cured? Do you still persist on the vitamins? At one point I want to wean myself off of pills and make my diet my main source of vitamins. Thank you!"
0,bacflip4,263,"Hi, I started the strict diet 3 days ago but, the last 2 days I’ve had nausea and diarrhea. Now on day 4 I have no appetite at all and my stomach feels so full and I don’t know why. I’m already super thin. I can see all my bones. I called my functional medicine doctor who said he wants me to cut back and only be like 85% strict for now. I want to put weight on but all weight gainers that I have found have sugar. here is one made by naturade that doesn’t have added sugar but still contains 13gms per serving. Do you think 13gms will be ok if thats the only sugar I’m knowingly having? I was being so good with no sugar but, I really need to put weight on some how. Thanks"
1,raster,263,"Check out this post: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst8180_Doing-too-much-too-fast.aspx I wouldn’t take these weight gain products and instead focus on nutrition.

2,bacflip4,263,"Thank you. I have read the post and will look into teff. I barely ate a thing today b/c I had no appetite what so ever. My stomach also felt so bloated. I forced a egg omlet into myself this morning. Over the past 3 days I was eating eggs in the morning usually with a veg, a good size salad in the afternoon with avacado, more eggs and veggies for dinner or a veggie soup. I was using some olive oil and coconut oil. I’m going to start a little slower but I’m def staying away from sugar. It’s very hard when you were already too thin to begin with. Maybe it’ll take me longer then others but, I’m determined to get better."
3,raster,263,"If you want to gain weight you need to eat more food and not rely on these weight gain shakes/drinks. I would try to eat 3, 3-4 course meals per day if possible until you are full like thanksgiving. In between meals I would snack on things like celery, nuts, etc. so that you don’t have blood sugar problems. You might want to focus on supplements that help with your appetite. -raster"
4,alexalgebra,263,"I totally feel your pain!! When I started the diet, I had the same problem. I was already thin, and I lost a lot of weight in the first couple of weeks. I also had some major bloating as I went through detoxing/die-off. However, I knew that it was all just my body going through changes, and that if I remained strict on the diet, and followed the protocol as it’s laid out on here, everything would even itself out. I can’t tell how happy I am that I stuck with it! I am not fully recovered, but I’m just over six months on the diet and have been able to do things I never would have dreamed of with how sick I was even just a few months ago. Focus on health and recovery, don’t worry about your weight. You’ll gain it back in time. (For reference, I went from 125 or so, down to 115ish, and now I’m back up to somewhere in the light 120s…haven’t weighed myself in awhile…I feel too healthy to care about my weight! But what I do know is my bones aren’t sticking out all gross like they were a few months back and I just feel good and energetic and, well, honestly…kinda sexy 😉 I have also been regularly doing yoga, which has definitely contributed to that!)"
5,Maxtoobad,263,"I found that if I ate eggs, organic bacon without the sugar sprayed on it, and a couple pieces of organic sausage (without sugar added), and ate fatty pieces of meat and such carb restrictions were not so bad. Make soups, and get creative. Make hummus and use lots of garlic. You’ll be surprised how many good meals you can make without sugar or high starchy/gluten foods and you’ll maintain your weight. These foods heal your gut lining as well. Bone broths are really good for this as well for healing leaky gut if that is something you have, which most Candida sufferers do."
6,alexalgebra,263,"Yeah……you definitely want to watch your meat intake, especially beef/pork. I am a vegetarian, so I’m not sure, but I think it’s recommended to only have meat once a week or so, and to also not overdo it with eggs. I have about 2-3 a day, on most days, maybe 5-6 days a week. Really, you want to be focusing mainly on eating those healing green veggies!! And other good veggies, of course, like rutabaga and radishes 🙂 I aimed for 70-80% of my diet to be veggies, especially in the beginning. (Other 20% being eggs and then once I added it back, buckwheat and oat bran, etc)"
0,meggiedarling,264,"How do you tell the difference between die off and a reaction? And how long should you wait to tell? I tried Kefir and Yogurt in small quantities for a few days and got headaches and tummy troubles, so I’m backing off those again for a while. Same thing with Soba noodles- I feel a little lightheaded after eating them. But since I take my supplements with meals as suggested, and since many of the foods are probiotic, prebiotic, and anti fungals, how can you tell if the symptoms you experience are die off related or a reaction? Several of my biggest symptoms prior to the diet are: blurry vision, severe brain fog, fatigue and yeast infection. Some days my vision and head are very fuzzy after eating and taking my supplements, and some days they are not. I can handle the symptoms if it really is die off, but I want to make sure if its a reaction that I stop. Any thoughts guys?? By the way, everyone on here is amazing! I love that this community is going to support and help others through this terrible condition! Bless you all!"
1,bluegrasgrl,264,"I wish I could help, but unfortunately I have same issue. I keep thinking its more bad than good. I take my supplements and my skin burns sometimes?!"
2,natorgader,264,"There’s no way for us to know except the way you feel after experiencing one or both. my reactions usually come with a lot of fatigue and not feeling like I can’t do much. The die-off is more of a full body feeling more in your head and makes me want to eat sugar a lot and need to use the bathroom constantly. make sure to take the recommended supplements before you start die-off. Reactions can come from anywhere after you eat a food to a couple days after I think. This is why when you test foods its recommended to take only a couple bites of it. I ate coconut bread and had a reaction but that’s because I wasn’t on the diet long enough before trying it and I ate too much. I woke up with overwhelming fatigue and pretty bad oral thrush, it sucks."
3,Maxtoobad,264,"I started making my own kefir and it knocked me back to some of my pre-candida symptoms. After many months I finally got the poisoned body feeling to go away. I started on kefir, and some of those symptoms came back. I have no idea if this was die-off or feeding the Candida. Kefir has yeast in it, and some kefir contains candida but not the pathogenic kind (from what they say, they being web blogs with no references), you have no way of truly knowing if it is in it or not. I want to drink kefir but I’m suspicious of it. It has a lot of good stuff in it, but if your immune system is compromised and your intestinal lining, gut bile and/or stomach ph is off, kefir maybe could cause issues? I don’t know. I don’t know any kefir experts. I will continue for the rest of this week on my kefir batches and keep you updated how I feel. Like our ancestors they had to experiment, I suppose that’s all we can do and just be sure to log all symptoms and reactions in a diary which I do. I will say, my pre-candida brain fog didn’t come back however after drinking kefir, just this allergenic/poisoned like feeling I used to get–no energy, very sick feeling, etc. So, we’ll see! Sometimes you have to fight fire with fire and get ill to get well, maybe it is die-off. Don’t know."
4,alexalgebra,264,"It’s so hard to tell!! I think that everyone is different and everyone has a different set of symptoms for each thing…for me, here’s how it (generally) goes: Leaky gut/intolerance reaction: Instant fatigue, brain fog, feelings of terribleness (I call this “Stage One”…my key word meaning I will be on the couch curled into a ball, miserable, and whining, or passed out somewhere for a couple of hours until it passes.) Candida: Itchy butt, smell of vinegar in my nose, itchy butt crack, itchy toes, twitchy toes, grumpiness, irrational anxiety Die-off/detox: Grumpiness and irritability (definitely #1), headaches, constipation, fatigue (but not the same as the leaky gut…it lasts longer but isn’t quite as acute) Basically, I would say just make sure you’re taking a ton of vitamin C (like 3-4k a day), molybdenum amino acid chelate, and milk thistle. Give it a little while (like several weeks) for everything to even out, and if you feel really awful, ease up on the antifungals and then slowly get back on them."
0,flipperflop,265," The diet works. It may or may not take you awhile to get it right. It took me two years. It may take you less or more. Now I know how to tackle my issues when they arise and can usually cure a yeast infection, bloating, diahhreah, bad breath and all that Candida jazz within a week or so. If I get bad symptoms after taking horrible meds from doctors like antibiotics, nexium it normally takes longer and it really sets me way back. So beware. The farther along I came in the diet the easier it became and the quicker I could get my symptoms under control. I used to have a CONSTANT yeast infection, now I can tackle it in a week and then maintain and keep it gone for months. I still have to be careful what I eat and still trying to figure out what sets me off but for the most part I am feeling soooo much better then I was….Here’s what I did… 1)	Followed the Candida diet as indicated on this website and try not to fall off track at all for indicated time, if you do fall off track get back on the wagon ASAP. It takes a lot longer to heal but you’ll still get there. It took me two years to actually follow through completely. Like full out what they say on the website. Also seen a natoropath for guidance (get one if you can) 2)	I took and still take a 25+billion probiotic twice daily before food 3)	Alternating anti-fungal on empty stomach every morning, only one or two a day (apple cider vinegar with water, oil of oregano-not if your pregnant, pau d’arko tea) very important, there are others too these are pretty gross but they work good so I just plug my nose and get it over with fast 4)	For external vaginal infection relief: •	anti-fungal baths/shower/washes/compress for external yeast infection(a few drops diluted tea tree, lavender or oregano oil)  •	creams found at the natural food store for yeast infections •	coconut oil (It’s a natural antifungal and can also be used as natural lubricant for intercourse) •	Plain yogurt 5)	For internal vaginal infection: •	Insert a probiotic capsule into the vagina before bed. (put a pad on in the morning because it will leak out during the day) •	insert an organic tampon that has been soaked in melted coconut oil and insert once it has cooled and leave in over night •	Plain yogurt soaked in organic tampon and inserted in vagina 6)	Avoid harsh medications prescribed by medical doctor if your life doesn’t depend on it, it can set you back months. especially antibiotics and nexium in my experience 7)	Take apple cider vinegar diluted with water for heart burn/ acid reflux/ indigestion DO NOT take Nexium or other harsh meds if your life doesn’t depend on it 8)	Supplements taken once you are feeling better for maintenance purposes; Greens +, vitamin D (especially in northern climates), garlic supplement.  9)	EXCERSISE!!! Its going to kill them f’ers. It can sometimes be hard to get motivated and just do it. Run around the house, random jumping jacks, push-ups, crunches, burpees, skipping rope, jog outside alone or with your dog, YOGA, Breath deep and LONG. Squats, rollerblading, dance like no one is watching. Get red in the face and SWEAT!! I exercise till I feel like puking. Get a video if needed. Just do it! (sorry bout the Nike reference) 10)	Drink so much water that you piss A LOT! It gets all the nasty toxins out. Like seriously 8-9 glasses a day. Always have water in your hand or at your desk or in your car whatever you do have water with you. Invest in a reusable bottle that doesn’t leech BPA.  11)	Relax! A lot of Candida can be caused by stress. Take 10 minutes a day for complete silence. Ask your partner to take care of kids, or ask your kids to take care of partner. And take time, Give yourself a massage, deep breathing, close your eyes think of your paradise. Yoga, sauna, steam bath, lay on the floor, a calm slow walk etc. whatever works for you. While at work take stretching breaks, I do it in the bathroom stall. Take moments here and there to take deep breathes. We tend to hold in our breath under stress, no good! 12)	Food Journal, Have a food journal somewhere close to your kitchen/ eating area. You can journalize your food which helps in a few ways,  a.	Helps you really see what you are eating, is it really healthy and pure and simple? Read the ingredients labels b.	Helps you remember which day you fell off track and ate something you weren’t supposed to, then link it to your symptoms. (my symptoms are always delayed, I don’t get them right after eating something I wasn’t supposed to, I get them like a day or two after which is why it’s important to only introduce one food back in per every 2-3 days and take note on any feelings subtle or not) c.	Once you have done the diet and started re introducing foods in slowly you can see which are your intolerances and try to stay away from them long term.  d.	You can bring your journal into your naturopath or nutritionalist, highly suggested, and they can guide you in the right direction. Hope this helps. It truly is/ was a long process for me. And results may vary. It’s a complete life changing diet and way of living. You have to get creative with it. But eventually you will get back on track. Your body will try to undo what harm/ environmental issues of the past. Your mission is to correct them by slowly restoring your body to health and maintaining it. And eventually you will be able to have that glass of wine and chocolate that you/I love so much, granted that you are not allergic to those things and those aren’t the factors that started your Candida. Good Luck!"
1,Sash,265,"Hey, really helpful info there thanks so much. I myself dont actually have vaginal thrush but am suffering from candida. Im ready to start on an anti fungal and the most effective one i think is diflucan (fluconazole), its a very strong drug so doctors are very reluctant to perscribe it. To buy it it would cost me around £100 ($185) which i really dont have so im hoping i can convince my doctor to perscribe it for me. Im not sure how to approach the situation though as candida is dismissed by most medical professional so do you think id be able to convince the GP i have vaginal thrush and have him perscribe the diflucan without any examinations?? i know its abit hasty but im really confident in this drug! Thanks again"
2,kaye,265,"Hi sash  Thanks for the wonderful encouragement , its really great to hear some positivety for once as alot of the forum seems to be negative unforts. I too am on the road to recovery , im pretty much doing the same as you , although not as intense with the exercise lol.And i havent tried the yoghurt internally or the probiotic yet , what an awesome idea 🙂 .Again thanks for the positiveness . good luck yourself . kaye x"
3,flipperflop,265,"Hey, I took diflucan once when my symptoms were really bad. It helped me for about a week and then my symptoms returned. However, my doctor was telling me that it could have been because my symptoms were so bad and he suggested I take it again. I haven’t took it again because it seems that my symptoms are finally under control. In Canada where I am from we can now buy diflucan over the counter. The doctor told me that Canestan now make a pill that you can buy from the drug store. I’m not sure if that’s the case in your area but its worth a look. Also, if you can find it the doctor prescribed me “saccharomyces boulardii” which is a strong form of probiotics they give to their patients who had a long dose of antibiotics. the pharmacist was also helpful and let me know that that is also an over the counter remedy that can be found at the drug store. If you have no luck with that being that you are in a different country and things may be different you may be able to find it at a natural food store. The doctor suggested taking the diflucan and saccharomyces boulardii at the same time. And also told me I may have to take diflucan more then once. However because I got so far in the diet and I feel better now for about a month I havent bothered but the saccharomyces boulardii helps for sure."
4,Amz,265,"I had a very bad case and spent a lot of money at the doctors and there meds, but that only made things worse and didn’t clear it up. The only thing that helped me was getting my ice tray and filling it half way with pro biotic yogurt and the other half with filtered water. Freeze them and then insert them two to three times a day. Mine cleared up with in 5 days! The coldness also soothes the irritation 🙂 hope this helps!"

6,Lauren,265,"Hi! Thanks for posting, this is all great info!  My vaginal infection story is a little different so I thought I might share just in case it helps someone. I had just found out about candida and started taking probiotics, some supplements, and eating a somewhat candida diet. I developed a sever vaginal infection to where I had to go to an urgent care because I was in so much pain and I could not get in to see my doctor. The doctor did the examination and then started asking relationship questions. He than told me that I have an STD and that my husband must have been unfaithful to me. I explained that was not possible. He thought that it must be a STD because how bad it was. He pressured me to taking shots for a whole bunch of STDs and told me if I did not that I might not be able to have children in the future. I told him that I would not take anything without getting real results. Plus I knew my husband would never cheat on me. A few days later I went to my regular doctor. She got the test results back and I had no STDs and nothing else was wrong. By this time I started to figured out that the proboitcs and other supplements I was taking might have shocked my system. Who would have thought that something good for me could cause such a reaction. So I stopped taking them for a while and the problem cleared up. I then slowly added everything that I was taking and never had a problem again. So my advice to anyone is slowly add supplements in instead of changing everything in a weeks time.  Thanks for the great info, Lauren"
7,Lorelei,265,Thanks very much for sharing these stories. All these insights are very helpful to anyone trying to free themselves from candida. I’m to the point where I am starting to introduce probiotics. I’ll heed your advice and will take it very slow.

2,many sparrows,266,Thankyou for helping. The info on the link was a bit scarey. Have you used olive leaf extract?
3,shayfo,266,"I haven’t. I’m too broke to buy antifungals and food separately, so I only used food antifungals: coconut oil, garlic, brussels sprouts, and rutabaga. They’re very effective!"
4,many sparrows,266,"Coconut oil I take liberally, and caprylic acid. I was taking oregano oil, which is fantastic,but cut down when started the cleanse(have been taking anti-fungals for years, which have kept the candida down but not killed it,as my diet wasn’t radical enough) Rather than buy more (expensive) oregano oil I wanted to try the neem product that I was persuaded to buy a while back but have been too cautious to take.I’ll ask again on general forum but unless I’m persuaded I wont risk it. Rutabaga I struggle with as I just can’t see how something with loads of carbs/starch in can help, although I know everyone says it does- I did try it last week and it seemed to stop the die-off I was possibly experiencing,but this could have just been because my mind is so against it! I have planted some brussels which will be ready for christmas; they are out of season here til winter and probably only available frozen.I think I’ll get some more oregano oil and am interested in olive leaf extract. Its good to read your positive  staightforward posts,thankyou."

If you’ll read the Forum Protocol  you’ll see that the instructions are to start with one teaspoon. In a few days you should raise that to two teaspoons, and a few days later raise to three teaspoons. Continue raising the amount very slowly until you’ve reached 15-18 teaspoons a day. I’m not at all surprised that you’re having trouble, just surprised that it’s not worse. Nutiva is a good brand, no need to change it. Just try to follow the instructions in the protocol the next time you start something new. Able"

Plus, you don’t need to stop taking it when you stop the other antifungals as it does not destroy the beneficial bacteria you are trying to reestablish. You can cook with the oil if you wish, but it would be much more potent and beneficial if you also take it by the spoonful in its raw form. When you start taking the coconut oil, start with (1) teaspoonful a day for three days. Then go up to (2) teaspoons for another three days, and then move up to (3) teaspoons. After this dose, continue raising the amount by one spoon every two days until you reach 15 to 18 spoonfuls a day. Women can easily go as high as 12 to 15 teaspoons a day, though I’ve seen a few go up to 16 and one went as high as 18 for over a week. If you’re a male, you should be able to eventually raise the amount to 15 to 18 teaspoons a day easily. check out bold part, this is extremely important for everybody. I was always trying to get better as soon as possible, and took antifungals in too high doses which would always set me back since I would get severe dieoff"

I have read that: 1/ Aloe vera is an antifungal; 1/ Aloe vera helps to cure inflamations. I am taking Forever Living Aloe Vera and Ihave been thinking it helps. Hello, Prizma; I’m certainly not going to tell you to stop taking aloe vera if you believe it’s helping you, but if you’ve read the forum protocol and all the links connected to it, you’ll see that aloe vera juice is not part of the treatment and in fact is never mentioned. This is mainly because I know that there are better herbs which will do a better job than aloe vera will. One problem I have with aloe vera juice is the fact that one of the three sections of the leaf contains anthraquinone stimulant laxatives. I believe that it’s counterproductive to use anthraquinones laxatives because they can cause laxative dependence. The other problem is that most aloe juices in the stores are diluted, sometimes extremely so. The FDA allows the manufacturers of aloe manufacturers to add around 90% water label the container as being 100% aloe vera juice, so you’re basically paying for water unless you make sure the label states that there is no water added to the aloe juice. In addition to water being added to most aloe juices, the aloe gel is never 100% aloe in that it’s manufactured by adding algin from seaweeds to the aloe in order to make it gel. Personally, I would prefer to take licorice root, yucca root, and slippery elm instead of aloe vera. Slippery elm is a muciliginous herb which means that it will form a slick mucilage which coats and soothes the intestines, plus it also acts a stool softener. In addition, slippery elm stimulates the immune system which aloe vera cannot d The licorice root and yucca root will help to build up the flora which in turn will reduce the intestinal inflammation that goes along with IBS and leaky gut. Slippery elm is capable of sucking up water when it aids in constipation, as with any supplement which is capable of helping constipation, be sure to drink a lot of water with it. Able"
5,Prizma,267,"I got mistaken from the directions on the box, stating 3 Tablespoons a day are recommended … Maybe this applies to people who do not have stomach problems, like candida. My die off is only felt like a pain in the legs, so I am not having much trouble yet. And yes, to some extent I’ve learned two lessons: Be more patient. Stick to the strict diet for at least six months. =============== Thanks Able again for detailed explanation. Here I can find Licorice Root so I will switch to it /NOW Foods/. However I am hesitant with immunestimulants as I have got Hashimoto disease and any additional intereference to the immune system is generally not recommended for it /as with many autoimmune diseases/."
6,momma1,267,how do you know how much coconut oil is okay to cook with? tonight i had used coconut oil to sautee my spinach and cook my chicken. now i’m freaking out wondering if i used to much and worried i might get the runs 🙁 Please help. am i only supposed to use 1 teaspoon like the protocol states? tonight was my first night using it. Thanks!
7,many sparrows,267,"Don’t freak out. Firstly, cooking with coconut oil probably makes it less powerful. Secondly,if you do have the runs it’ll only be temporary, and you just need to reduce the amount you take, then gradually build up day by day. Coconut oil is a whole food which means that its more balanced and gentle than taking a drug or supplement which has been extracted and refined."

When I weaned myself off the Lexapro the hairloss stopped."

Just a twinge of an itch for a second and that’s all. I am on the candida diet, and also on natural antifungals and 100 billion probiotic. I have done both and intestinal cleanse and am on a parasite cleanse. I will continue to post about this. I have only 3 Diflucan pills so I am only using this to jumpstart. I will see if this works.

2,goingnatural,269,"Diflucan is great. I am on it long-term, I also take many other natural antifungals, in addition to a clinically researched supplement for biofilms (which I have posted about). Of course, this is all with a very clean diet."
3,goingnatural,269,"Also, since it is often brought out that Diflucan is liver toxic I’d like to provide a link describing this: http://livertox.nlm.nih.gov/Fluconazole.htm In summary: Diflucan can cause transient (temporary) elevations of liver enzymes in up to 5% of patient’s treated with the medication, the liver enzymes returned to normal once the medication was suspended.

6,willsurvive,269,"Thanks for the info. I think that Candida is passed through the womb in a mom’s blood and milk. Both my mom, sister, and i have had severe infestations of candida. It could also be that we took antibiotics as kids and so did my mom, but I just have a feeling, in addition to the candida, that emotional states tend to pass down the line through generations. My mother, sister, and I all anxious. I believe, fear and an anxiety and emotional root of candida."

If you have a bad case of candida, your liver will be burdened just from any die off before you add in a powerful drug. It did not work for me, which I can attribute to:Congested liver (low bile flow, LOTs of stone) – only started seeing real progress after liver flushing (Hulda Clark method)Parasite(s)Imbalance of environment in intestines/body – you can kill candida all you want, but they will just grow back. I had a tapeworm, which only contributed to the toxic environment. I think a main benefit of the stricter diet besides avoiding feeding candida is balancing your own environment."

I had symptoms of die off (felt like death), my dry scalp started subsiding, my anal itching got better…. Is it possible to still have Candida and not have it show in a test? All I know is when my Dr told me I didn’t have it, I took a few off plan bites and then fell off completely. Been binging and eating like crap for a month and I’m 20 lbs heavier. So disappointed in myself and I’m not sure what to do about it. Any suggests? Is this normal that it could still exist with no positive tests? Thank you!"

I had to learn and accept that eating like everyone else is not an option and smile about it. I think the more you harbor on it the worse it becomes.

2,Monte,271,"I really liked and appreciated your response, thank you. I’ve been so down and out having a horribly pity party lately and your positive post was just I needed today. I was on the diet for 2 1/2 months and noticed some of my symptoms getting better (dry scalp mostly). I know for a fact I had horrible die off symptoms the first few days and had all the symptoms others described through the treatment like fatigue, exhaustion, sleeping all the time, etc (although I have those all the time anyway). When my Dr. said I didn’t have Candida I took that as an excuse to eat whatever I wanted again. I started off doing good, but literally took one bite of dessert and haven’t stopped eating since. I’m up 20 lbs in just a few weeks and I am so miserable. Sometimes the cravings are so bad. And the constant hunger is the worst. I NEVER feel full and don’t know when to stop eating. I started the HCG diet a few days ago hoping to help curb the hunger (it’s worked for me in the past, but it’s not this time) and lose the weight then I was planning on going back to the strict diet on here. Problem is, I’ve been so down I feel like after the routine viscous cycles I’ve been through with this these last 5 years, I’ve all but thrown in the towel and given up. I’ve had 4 shoulder surgeries in the last few years, 2 of them within a few months of each other then had 2 level disc replacement surgery in my neck 4 weeks ago (just three months after my last shoulder surgery). Add to that horrible hormone issues and imbalances since last fall, and I have to say, feel so defeated and beat up that I’m dreading starting this diet again for fear of failing… Again. I have prayed and asked God for healing for years. I know it’s all in His timing for a purpose, but I don’t get it. I’m at my wits end. Thank you again for your post – it does at least give me hope."

They all look quite pricey and my husband and I are in a bit of an unexpected hardship right now and wouldn’t be able to do them right now anyway : ( As for antibiotics, yep, I’ve done several rounds of Azithromycin (Z-packs) over the last few years. I’ve also had 3 surgeries within this last year. I don’t know about my first two shoulder surgeries, but at my last surgery a month ago for my cervical disc replacements, they made me take IV antibiotics. I seriously didn’t know how bad antibiotics were for you so I took the Z-packs over the last few years and didn’t ask for my first two surgeries, but I’m wondering if antibiotics are common for surgery? If so, then I’ve done several rounds over the last few years… YIKES! No wonder I feel like complete and total crap. I am having the most ridiculously difficult time getting started back on the cleanse and diet. My hunger (and cravings) are so horrific I literally feeling like killing someone for food or for certain foods. How do I get past that to get back on track?

I phoned my GP who told me that he can’t give me another course of Fluconazole as you can only be on it for 6 months, so he has given me 6 months worth of pessaries to take. I have been reading up on this online and have read so many threads recommending different things that I am now really confused as what to buy!

I did notice when I cut sugar and dairy, it seemed to really help, especially now with this diet. My face is not clear yet but has drastically improved since being on the diet. Androgens are the hormones that generally lead to acne….sugar causes androgen flare ups and consuming dairy products is like pumping your body full of hormones. Even if you buy hormone free dairy products, this does not really mean “hormone free” as the cow is naturally producing hormones for her calf and then we eat/drink those hormones. Many people have found success in doing this. If you are already completely sugar and dairy free, there are medications to control hormones, but I personally don’t believe in them as i think you’re only masking the problem.

I just started that as well and have seen an improvement. Also, I’ve read that a liver cleanse helps. I have not done it, but am taking Dandelion root instead. Apparently if your liver is not working properly, your skin is the next organ to detoxify everything from your body. Hang in there! People don’t understand how emotionally painful acne can be. Keep up that water intake too. I am sure you are, but I noticed my skin was the absolute clearest when I was breastfeeding my kids and I was drinking a TON of water."

Yes it’s 100% Jojobal oil.It is more of a moisturizer than a face wash.I don’t think washing your face in oil is very beneficial,as it strips away immediately what you have put on your skin.Oils are meant to sit and sink in.Jojoba is nice and light."

They stopped (touch wood) I still have the drunk zonked feeling when I eat and my throat feels as it closes up and hard to breathe At first I thought allergic/anaphalyptic reaction but I don’t think so cos sometimes I eat the exact same food fine then other times I cant if it was anaphalyptic it would happen all the time surely. its terryfying So I have had no answer for this and havent been able to eat properly for a year I’m stick thin I desperately want to eat, its gotten slightly better but some days still I can’t eat, am going to see an ENT next month Could it be candida in the eosophagus doing this?

1,tanyanurse,275,I get worse brain fog everytime I eat. I refrain from eating when I have something important like a meeting. I eat very little throughout the day and eat more before I go to bed because I am going to sleep anyway so it doesn’t matter so much. I have tried treating my thyroid and adrenals but I never respond well to the treatment. So….I ended up here treating candida. I just started ont he strict diet one week ago. I suppose I feel I alittle worse and i am told it is due to die off. I think you may be in the right place. How did you find this forum What lead you to believing you have candida?
0,mary12345,276,"Hey i’m Mary 25 from Kent England, I have had candida symptoms as far back as i can remember, in my teens i had allergies, rashes, athletes foot, feeling tired and no energy, gum disease, warts and also a bad odor coming from myself. But it is only this past year i’ve found out about candida. We went to numerous doctors to no avail. It was only when i went to see jan de vrice when he said instantly he could smell candida from me. But after getting help from dietitians and numerous different herbs i’m still no further forward. The BAD SMELL is worst part of this and it really gets me down, i could shower 4 times a day and still be smelling bad afterwards, i’ve had to stop socializing with friends because of the jokes and embarrassment of it all. I really wish this would just go away and give me my life back, has anyone else with this had symptoms of bad smell coming from their body? And why is this? Any how to rid it? any ideas to good strong candida killers? Thanks Mary xx"
1,Floggi,276,"  Could you describe the bad smell? There are a number of digestion disorders that result in the inability to break down some waste products, causing these products to build up to abnormally high levels. This may cause a body smell. Depending on the disorder, one may smell like ammonia, or like fish. Other smells are possible too, but I’m not an expert in this field, so I cannot provide you with an exhaustive list. Skin and eye color (the white part of the eye) might change as well. But I think there are digestion disorders that do cause a smell without causing a change in the color of the skin or eyes. Anyway, if you describe the smell to a doctor, he/she can order a simple blood test for increased levels of some waste product or byproduct. That would give you a clue as to the underlying disorder. Some of them are even easily curable – though some others can only be semi-cured by adhering to a strict diet. Anyway, if you haven’t already done so, ask your doctor.  "
2,suzi,276,"Hi, I too have terrible body odour, never used to smell at all, if I have a bath the next day I can stink again, it smells like only what I can describe as a diesel/petrol smell from my armpits and also other times fungus like creamy cheese or something its disgusting I also notice if I pick dry hard bits of skin off my lips my finger / the skin smells cheesy . horrible! Does this sound like candida? Mary, did Jan de Vries give you anything for the candida? I was thinking about going to see him, did it help at all? Its frustrating how there isn’t any tests for candida available on the NHS, how are you supposed to know whether you have it"
3,mary12345,276,Its like a yeasty/ fieces smell. I was told i have leaky gut also but its all so hard to get rid off. Someone mentioned hydrochloric acid? would that kill it quickly? I also tryed threelac and it never worked for me.

0,suzi,279,For the last year I’ve been drinking ensure milkshake which contains vitamins and minerals and prebiotics fat and omega oils. But they also contain sugar and corn syrup. I have m.e/CFS and take ensure to help me with that and to put weight on but I also suspect I have candida as if often the case with CFS/m.e I feel bad about taking the drinks cos they have sugar in them but I don’t have any other vitamin supplements I don’t know if they’re actually doing more harm or good? As I say I suspect I have candida but don’t know 100% certainly have all the symptoms I tried going without my drinks for a week and I was terrible I lost a lot of weight and my muscles and legs were very sore and very weak. So I’ve gone back on them as I have to maintain a good weight I was down to 6 stone without them I don’t know what to do as otherwise I’m avoiding all sugar and only eat eggs bacon veg chicken water I have read about other vitamin minerals products that don’t contain sugar and are a much stronger % of vitamins and minerals but with no sugar I don’t know whether to try them and give up ensure but then I will lose weight I can’t seem to put weight on just food alone Its easy to stick with ensure cos I’m used to them and although they help me they’re not giving me a real boost Since I’ve been taking them the funny thing is my symptoms have improved but I think that’s the vits and minerals but surely if the sugar in them were really feeding candida my symptoms would have got worse? Can anyone advise what to do? I’m worried if I don’t take that step to try this alternative vitamin mineral powder designed for CFS/m.e (energy revitilisation system – fatigued to fantastic) with the stronger vits and also NAC which is good for cfs I worry that I might miss my chance of getting better What should I do? Of course my worry is also that I might have a reaction to the new powder as I have mulpitle sensitivities and used to have seizures whenever I ate food Can anyone please help? Thanks
0,msmofish,280,okay I’m NOT promoting cheating but truth be told I’m having a hard time on weekends. My man & I like to go to restaurants & enjoy. I try to be as conscious as I can w/o cheating but sometimes the temptation is too much or there are hidden ingredients that set me off Like I said I am NOT advocating cheating When I do cheat or have hidden ingredients in my food – do I up antifungals or probiotics ? Right I’m taking along with all the suggested vitamins etc on protocol: – Capryl by Solaray 2 pills a day 2163mg per pill – Probiotics Ultimate Flora 50 billion 1 pill a day Next week I’ll be switching to oregano oil please advise much thanks Mo
1,Keya,280,"I advise you to try not to cheat, because that way you end up going in circles. If you eat out, order steamed veggies, green salad or fish on a grill. Ask about the ingredients in every dish. Don’t order sauces, soups or something similar, you can’t be sure what’s in them. But try not to eat out often, it’s so much safer to prepare your own food. Regarding probiotics/antifungals, I’m not really sure,I think it would be ok just to take the doses you’re taking normally. Btw I think you need to take more probiotics (100 billion daily)."
2,alexalgebra,280,"Yeah, honestly, I don’t think it’s possible to get better while cheating regularly. You can’t think that you’re entitled to certain foods, because you’re not. You got to enjoy them for a long time, now you don’t get to for awhile unless you want to continue to make yourself sick. You should be thinking about how you can best assist your body in healing right now, not how to indulge in things that will make your body worse. Also, the more you cheat, the more you will crave cheating. It’s a vicious cycle. Don’t think that everyone on here doesn’t enjoy eating out or having something rich or sweet to eat. Everyone does. But to heal, we have to change the way we live. It’s a bummer, but you have to just mourn the loss of being carefree and move on or you won’t heal, you know?"
3,msmofish,280,I know I know I know This diet is restrictive & hard I wasn’t asking advice about cheating nor be judged for doing so.  I do NOT want to cheat & as I said I am NOT advocating cheating. I was asking for advice on what’s best IF it happens or IF there are hidden ingredients that set me off – are probiotics or antifungals better to double up on.

That’s probably difficult to say, because cheating will often induce symptoms. If you already have an increase in symptoms I think it would be unwise to increase things that are going to cause die-off. I don’t think there is any simple work-around to this. If you want to mildly cheat occasionally in order to avoid entirely abandoning your social life, you need to prepare for a longer and rockier treatment time. For instance, this weekend is my girlfriend’s 21st birthday. She is having a BBQ and I am meeting all of her extended family for the first time. To avoid looking like a complete douche-bag and because I want to enjoy myself I will be eating organic buffalo burgers with mustard (both candida friendly versions) and fried onions in gluten-free buns. I just have to accept that by doing this I am undermining at least a little bit of the progress I have made. I think balance is very important. Mild cheating on occasion won’t doom you to a life of candida, but heavy, regular cheating may very well make actual recovery difficult. No amount of probiotics or antifungals can change that."
5,msmofish,280,"Hi Cheesey Thanks for your reply Last night at a restaurant I ate scrambled eggs w garlic, spinach, avocado & broccoli & salad with pea sprouts olive oil & lemon. They had gluten free bread so I asked if there was any sugar, answer was no so I ordered it. I made the mistake of not asking all the ingredients. When I got the bread I ate 2 bites & knew it wasn’t on the diet. It was made from corn – rrrrr So when I got home I doubled up on the oregano oil. I have no idea if this was the best course to take to combat it but I did it. Another lesson learned. So when I say “cheating” this is what I’m talking about. Not going hog wild & eating a whole cheesecake I’m trying my best ! Thanks for your feedback & best of luck at the party this Saturday !!"
6,raster,280,"What really worked well for me is that I continued my supplements during the cheat events and I took a 100 billion cfu probiotic for a week (so increase probiotic amounts). It just worked and I don’t know why (I am referring to my recent trip). Also if you support your liver afterwards, this will help detox (or use other detox methods). -raster"

Firstly, your question title was, “Cheating? need advice” So, I can understand why some people responded the way they did. Also, this isn’t just aimed at you, but, something we all need to consider when we post something on here: No one is getting paid to reply to a post. We all do this to help each other out. In fact, selflessly. So, I think we should try our darndest to show appreciation and gratitude for people’s responses to our topics. Always. Now, about your question:  I think eventually, after a period of health. your body will be able to sustain “hidden” ingredients much better. So, perhaps you could see this as temporarily as restrictive it is until your body heals. I suggest trying 2-4 caps of activated charcoal when you eat something with “hidden ingredients”. Which something you might want to carry with you especially when eating out."

0,greenD,281,"Hello everybody! I am new to this forum. I have been reading posts for a few weeks now as I have been researching Candida. Over the weeked I saw my mother in law and she told me that she was battling Candida in the early 90’s. She tried many things including the diet for 6 months. However, the only thing that helped her to obtain relief from Candida was a Fortune Delight drink from Sunrider. She said that when she started drinking it her tongue became covered with thick white coating that she had to scrape of. She drank it for a few months and after that have not suffered from the common Candida symptoms – brain fog, fatigue, etc. And I can vouch for that. As long as I’ve known her (13 years now) she has been and is full of energy. She does maintain for the most part a healthy diet but not strict Candida diet. My question is – did anyone else here heard of or has tried Fortune Delight? Thank you for your time."

0,charlie1,283,"Hi There, I believe that I’ve been suffering with candida problems for possibly 10-15 years after having tests that confirmed I did have excess candida. I’ve been trying to battle with the candida for the last two years with success on the diet I’ve been following. However, in the last 4 months I’ve been using various anti-fungals and have noticed a lot of die-off symptoms. In the last two months I seem to be at a point now where I don’t even need anti-fungals anymore and still seem to be suffering really badly, mainly with fatigue. I’ve been abit constipated over the last two months as well. I have noticed major improvement in other symptoms such as profuse sweating, nasal congestion and wind, these have almost cleared up. I have purchased some Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate and have been taking about 500-600mcg a day for about a week now with low strength milk thistle as well. I’ve ordered Milk Thistle 3000mg and Vitamin C 1000mg so, hopefully they will make a difference soon. Could I be going through some major die-off seeing as I’ve probably has candida for so long? How long can the die-off go on for? I’m just really confused as every time I’ve been on the diet in the past I’ve normally had major improvement within about a week or so. I’ve been up and down on the diet quite abit over the last two years. Charlie."
1,charlie1,283,"The Milk Thistle, Vit C and Molybdenum seem to working really well now! Good times!!"
2,DMC101,283,"Charlie, how did you know if you had candida? Did you have a blood test or a stool test? Do you have a lot of food allergies? I’ve read that “leaky gut” from candida results in food allergies. I have a lot of those. I just recently spent quite a bit of money on NAET treatments for food allergies, but now I’m pissed that the first treatment I got was for candida and the first question asked was: Have you taken antibiotics? So the self-serving biotch decided to take my money and put a bandaid on food allergies knowing full well she CAN’T get rid of the candida. Some people…. Hope you’re enjoying that money you STOLE from me!!!! Do you have ringing in your ears too? I have it bad! Have you seen white fuzzy stuff in the toilet bowl? Sounds gross but let’s attack the beast!"
3,charlie1,283,"Hey DMC, Attack the beast indeed!I had a food intolerance test two years ago that confirmed it and also a live blood analysis a couple of months back. It’s been pretty costly to be honest but worth it. I haven’t had white fuzzy stuff in the toilet before but have had lots of other weird things. All part of my poor digestive health from candida I think. Luckily I don’t have any food allergies and I did used to get ringing in my ears some years ago, used to happen quite a bit actually. I’ve read about leaky gut from candida and a bit about food allergies which I know is a bit of a complicated situation. Are you following quite a strict diet at the moment?"

0,Keya,285,"I’ve been suffering from vaginal candida for several years, and have never been able to get rid of it. I’ve been on the forum protocol for three and a half months, and I am still experiencing the die-off symptoms. The itching and inflammation on my vaginal and anus area just won’t go away and I’m feeling like these symptoms are even getting worse. I’m also experiencing bloating and constipation, which I didn’t have before starting the diet. I’m aware these are die-off symptoms, but I just can’t realize why are they still here after so much time on the diet. Here is my diet: Breakfast: glass of warm water with one lemon two eggs baked on coconut oil salad with olive oil Lunch: meat/fish a lot of veggies salad Snack: coconut bread/buckwheat crackers Dinner: bone/veggie broth homemade kefir salad with olive/sesame oil and raw garlic –also much herbal tea during the whole day Ok, here I think I maybe realize what I am doing wrong – meat or fish every day for lunch. It is because I don’t have the energy to go through the day only on veggies and I was always under the assumption that meat is better than carbs so I avoided buckwheat and oat bran (at first I baked only coconut bread). Now I am trying to change that – replace the meat/fish with buckwheat a few times a week. Is this a good idea? How much buckwheat daily can I eat? Supplements I’m taking: – Vitamin C – 1000mg – 2 times daily – Biotin – 300mcg – one time daily – Probiotics – Darmflora plus select – 48billion CFU – 8 strains – these are the most powerful I can find in my country – unfortunately they have B-vitamins added (B1, B2, B6, B12), but I’m thinking that they have more benefits than damage. – coconut oil – 5-12 teaspoons daily – every two weeks I’m rotating GSE, garlic capsules and oregano oil – GSE: 30 drops 3 times daily or 2 garlic caps daily or oregano oil – I think I took too high doses of it – like 12 drops 3 times daily – is it too much?  – also: homemade kefir, raw garlic, extra-virgin oilve oil Unfortunately, I don’t have molybdenum in my country, and can’t order it (the customs wouldn’t allow it in the country). Also, I must confess, I started cheating a few weeks ago with a small cup of black coffee one time daily (with no sugar or milk of course). It is because I have very low blood pressure and I was feeling nauseaus and fatigued all the time. Also, it helps me with constipation (sometimes I didn’t go for days to the toillet, and then after one cup of coffee immediately). I’m aware I should quit it, but I was feeling bad also the first two and a half months when I didn’t drink coffee, and I am feeling bad now and don’t see the difference. It’s like whatever I do nothing is changing. I am now feeling like I ate a chocolate and drank five beers, and not like I’ve been on a diet for more than 3 months 🙁  Also I am taking a homeopatic supplement, going to yoga classes, and started going to sauna recently. What would be your suggestions? I know not taking Molybdenum is bad, but I don’t know what to do about it. How much meat/fish per week can I have, and how much buckwheat? Which supplement would you suggest in addition to the ones that I am taking (I am thinking of Calcium-Magnesium-Zinc)? Due to my limited budget I was maybe thinking of giving up on GSE and oregano oil and investing in more probiotics (taking the double dose daily of the ones I am using now)? I also didn’t get my period for two months and I am worried it’s because of the diet (before it was regular) – has anyone else had this problem? Thanks to everyone willing to help 🙂"
1,raster,285,"I would consider trying out super milk thistle X which should help you detox from the candida toxins. Another alternative is sweating out the toxins by doing a sauna, hot tub, steam room, jacuzzi, or even hot bath. This can completely reduce the die-off symptoms. Candidate is also somethin that can help with die-off. You are taking very large doses of antifungals; 30 drops at a time is high. If you want to, you can reduce. Ideally, you should slowly increase your dose to get to this level over a period of time startin out with 3 drops per day. So are you eatin meat 2x per day? I would reduce to 1x per day and increase your buckwheat, oat bran, etc. I would check out chamomile tea which is a good alternative to coffee; it is antifungal and promotes digestion…it also perks you up and gives you energy if you steep it longer than 8 mins. -raster"

There are a lot of reasons why you’re not improving, the main one being that you’re not on the forum protocol. You probably need to spend more time on the forum learning about the infestation. The reasons you’re not getting better are below. Stop taking the GSE, you should have taken it for perhaps two to three weeks at the most. It’s an antibacterial as well as an antifungal and is destroying the beneficial bacteria you’re trying t o increase. You can also stop taking oil of oregano since it also contains antibacterial properties. Are you taking virgin coconut oil by the spoonful every day? You didn’t mention this, or at least I didn’t see it. If you are, how many teaspoons are you taking in a day’s time?Due to my limited budget I was maybe thinking of giving up on GSE and oregano oil and investing in more probioticsThat’s exactly what you should do. According to your diet, you’re drinking kefir only once a day. At what amount? You’re going to have to increase this if you want to cure your infestation. This is especially true considering the lack of a better probiotic. You’re right about the animal protein (meat and fish). Cutting out animal protein has the ability to actually cause die-off; that’s how much it benefits the Candida. And I doubt that you’re purchasing all organic meats. This means that you’re ingesting an antibiotic every time you eat meat. This is assuming that your country uses antibiotics for cattle, etc. You could eat at least a serving or two of buckwheat every day, and you can also eat a lot of the coconut bread with virtually no benefit to the Candida. If you’re using Bob’s Red Mill Oat Bran, it shouldn’t present a problem even if eaten every day. Can you find organic eggs? If so, you can increase the amount to at least three or four a day as long as they present no problems for you. Do you make the buckwheat crackers yourself? Considering that you’re having trouble reestablishing the beneficial flora in your intestines, stop eating garlic altogether. Garlic is a natural antibiotic. You can eat rutabaga and Brussels sprouts as natural antifungals. Are you using either pure sea salt or Himalayan salt?

11,Able900,285,"Keya;37234 wrote: Concerning the parasites, do you mean parasites in the digestive system? Yes, that’s right. A majority of people with a Candida overgrowth will have parasites as well. This is because they both thrive in the same type of environment.I can find Milk Thistle from Solgar, I will get it as soon as I can. Try to get one with around 70 to 80% silymarin per dose if you can. Silymarin is the property in milk thistle which makes it a valuable herb for the liver. The Super Milk Thistle X which Raster mentioned contains 80% silymarin which is an excellent amount.I have one more question concerning the buckwheat and oat bran – how come they are ok for candida concerning they are carbs. Because they are both prebiotics which means they’re two of the foods which feed the beneficial bacteria that you’re trying to replace. Sometimes, on a Candida protocol, it’s a matter of more good than harm. But if you use the correct form of oat bran and not the type such as the regular commercial oatmeal in the grocery stores, then there should never be a problem.Ok, so then I stop eating raw garlic also? I don’t understand why, if you could please explain? Actually, this was explained in my last post. Quote: “Considering that you’re having trouble reestablishing the beneficial flora in your intestines, stop eating garlic altogether. Garlic is a natural antibiotic. You can eat rutabaga and Brussels sprouts as natural antifungals.” Garlic is a pretty strong antibiotic which means that it’s destroying the beneficial bacteria that you need to reestablish in the intestines. Since you’re not taking a very good probiotic, you need to avoid anything that will destroy the bacteria. As I stated, you can replace the garlic with both rutabaga and Brussels sprouts. At this point, you need to concentrate on reestablishing the bacteria more than anything else. If you have enough, the beneficial bacteria can destroy the Candida.I’m taking 5 to 12 teaspoons daily. Should I take it in a bigger dose? The other day I took 12 teaspoons and had a strong die-off the next day, so now I’m taking about 5 teaspoons daily. Try to raise this amount very, very slowly to 15 teaspoons a day. You didn’t mention whether or not it’s “virgin” coconut oil. Able"

I chop up some garlic for my veggie stir-frys, but do not use every day. In the beginning of the treatment, garlic is fine. Antifungals which also act as an antibiotic can be taken for the first month or two in order to lessen the population of the Candida quicker, but it depends on the probiotic that you’re able to take as well as the degree of your Candida symptoms. For example, when all of the die-off and Candida symptoms are much less intense than they were in the beginning, it would likely be time to concentrate on rebuilding the flora and stop the type of antifungals which also act as an antibiotic.  But the point is, everyone is different and everyone will likely need to stop the antifungals/antibiotics at different times. This is why the protocol doesn’t give a definite time limit on these specific antifungals. Contacting us on the forum with your progress is the best way to know when to do what.I bought GSE first, but haven’t taken due to feedback. What two antifungals, then, would you primarily recommend? Coconut Oil and SF722? Both; but I understand that SF722 is difficult to obtain right now.

0,Able900,288,"Acetaldehyde is a fungal waste product belonging to the aldehyde group of toxins. Most of the damage which is caused by Candida albicans is the result of this specific waste product. Acetaldehyde affects the metabolic, neurological, endocrine, and immune systems in human beings, and there are very few chemicals which are capable of creating as much havoc in the human body as acetaldehyde can. This is the same toxin which causes hangovers in heavy drinkers, and is believed to be the major source of tissue damage experienced by alcoholics rather than the alcohol itself (think about cirrhosis of the liver). An enzyme in the human body called aldehyde oxidase is capable of breaking down the aldehyde toxins into less toxic substances therefore causing less trauma to the body. Aldehydes produced in the body by Candida or other means must be handled by aldehyde oxidase metabolic pathways. Aldehyde oxidase is dependent on the mineral molybdenum, riboflavin (vitamin B2), and iron. Ironically, Candida albicans are also dependent on iron which explains why those with a Candida albicans infestation will normally and eventually become deficient in iron. Obviously, taking a pure iron supplement would not be the answer to this problem since the Candida would make use of it. However, a supplement by the name of Apo-Lactoferrin can be taken instead of an iron supplement. During heavy die-off symptoms a supplement of B2 could possibly help to lessen the toxins, and of course doses of Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate should be started before the treatment and taken off and on until the die-off completely stops occurring.

11,shayfo,288,"“Various factors influence copper absorption. For example, copper absorption is enhanced by ingestion of animal protein, citrate, and phosphate. Copper salts, including copper gluconate, copper acetate, or copper sulfate, are more easily absorbed than copper oxides[disambiguation needed].[30][31] Elevated levels of dietary zinc, as well as cadmium, high intakes of phytate and simple sugars (fructose, sucrose) inhibit dietary absorption of copper.[32][33][34][35][36][37][38] Furthermore, low levels of dietary copper inhibit iron absorption. Some forms of copper are not soluble in stomach acids and cannot be absorbed from the stomach or small intestine. Also, some foods may contain indigestible fiber that binds with copper. High intakes of zinc can significantly decrease copper absorption. Extreme intakes of Vitamin C or iron can also affect copper absorption, reminding us of the fact that micronutrients need to be consumed as a balanced mixture. This is one reason why extreme intakes of any one single micronutrient are not advised.[39] Individuals with chronic digestive problems may be unable to absorb sufficient amounts of copper, even though the foods they eat are copper-rich.” http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_in_health This is interesting, since many of us are taking zinc, iron, and vitamin C (often lots of vitamin C)…also, the whole thing about us having chronic digestive problems :p A few articles I read say that copper anemia and iron anemia are different things that are confused for one another, and other articles say copper deficiency leads to iron anemia.

I haven’t used this one but the 100+ reviews look pretty good. So we all have natural estrogen, testosterone, and progesterone. Progesterone is the happy hormone that also helps with sleep, moods, irritability, pms, irregular cycles. I take a compounded prog. from my doctor, but I haven’t really felt the need in the last 9 months. Birth control is all synthetic hormones that basically suppress our natural hormones so we can’t get pregnant. I didn’t like the way I felt on birth control and labs verified they indeed suppressed every one of my levels. Natural progesterone is taken by many women who can’t get pregnant or have miscarriages to help retain pregnancy. So you definitely need an alternative birth control; I just have an app that alerts me the days I’m most likely to get pregnant and that’s worked for me. Besides antibiotics, synthetic birth control is another contributing factor to candida."

0,Cheesey,291,"Hi Folks I’ve made the decision to heavily cut back on my brown rice consumption. I don’t think I need to cut it out altogether because I still haven’t noticed a reaction, however I should really make use of the other great foods that are available to me. Moreover, it helps to negate the uncertainty in this area. On that note, what are your guys opinions of green lentils? Here they are are nutritiondata.self: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4338/2 and, for the sake of comparison, here is buckwheat: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5683/2 From what I can see, lentils appear to have very marginally more readily available sugars at 1.8% rather than 0.9%. However, there are other benefits such as lower glycemic load and significantly less inflammation. Moreover, lentils appear to be an excellent source of protein (albeit not complete like buckwheat) and also dietary fibre! It’s also more nutrient dense than buckwheat! Finally, it’s not in the grain family (I know buckwheat isn’t either) so it doesn’t get that bad rep from the SCD people and grain-haters either. I’m certainly not trying to bad-mouth buckwheat, I’ve finally discovered how to cook it in such away that I really enjoy it*. However, it appears that there is this other great food-source here, but no one on the forum really seems to talk about it very much. Do other people eat lentils? Is there something I’m missing here on why it isn’t the great food-source it appears to be? *I put some oil in the bottom of a pan. Throw some black pepper, salt, turmeric or whatever else you have lying around in there and mix it up. Chuck my buckwheat in and stir it around for 3 to 5 minutes. Finally I pour some on some water hot from the kettle and set it away for 20 minutes."

3,Cheesey,291,Thanks guys! It’s certainly great to find something to add that extra little bit of diversity to the diet.

My question is that when I look at water kefir online, it usually calls for me to add sugar. isn’t this a no-no? Is it just a flavor thing? If so I could probably just use Stevia no?  Anyone have a recommendation for a good water Kefir that is ideally low maintenance  Also my doc told me to stay on the candicid until i finished the bottle, but i read in the forum about candida adapting. Should I change antifungals at this point 6weeks in? Also, I cook exclusively with extra virgin organic coconut oil. my diet is meat vegetables, and coconut bread. also should I take more probiotic capsules at this point? add the water kefir?"
1,alexalgebra,294,"Water kefir eats sugar. Here’s my recommendation on how to prepare it: So you want to make your own water kefir… Awesome! You rock! Here is what I have found to be the best “recipe” for plain water kefir. The grains are happy, healthy, and plentiful when this is followed: 1.	Get a jar or other suitable container for your kefir (it needs to have a lid that can close) and fill it about 70% of the way with spring or filtered water. 2.	Add about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of organic dark brown sugar and 1 tbsp of organic molasses. (Yes, you need both for optimal results! They feed on the sugar, but molasses is like a vitamin boost for them.) 3.	Mix the sugar and molasses into the water so it’s all dissolved. The water will be a murky brown color. 4.	Add 1/3 to 1/2 cup of kefir grains. Find someplace warm to put the jar and don’t screw the lid on quite all the way. 5.	After two days, it should definitely have a fermented (slightly alcoholic) smell. At this point, it sort of tastes like an alcoholic sarsaparilla. You can drink it like this, or if you want to flavor it further or eliminate more sugar, you can do a secondary ferment. 6.	Either way, strain out the grains and repeat from step 1 with them. 7.	To do a secondary ferment, you can add in flavors, such as a piece of fruit, extra sugar, or herbs (there are many different recipes that can be found online). If you want to reduce the sugar and not add extra flavorings, just leave it be. Tighten the lid and let it sit for an additional 24-48 hours. 8.	At any point, if you don’t want it to ferment further, put your water kefir in the refrigerator. Grains can also be stored in the fridge if you need to take a break for up to several weeks – just be sure to store them in a sugar water solution! 9.	Enjoy your water kefir! It should be slightly bubbly, slightly sweet, and slightly alcoholic tasting when it’s done (although it only contains a very, very small percentage of alcohol and will not get you drunk, no worries!)"

0,Hallmark,295,"I’m on week 12 of the official protocol and am enjoying my diet. I will try to compile a short history of my health for anyone to toss out a few ideas on what I may have omitted. Short version: I’ve had to clear my throat often for years. For the past nine or ten years I have had hypoglycemic symptoms (irritable, sleepy after meals, some mental confusion) that were mostly controlled with a “healthy American diet” of whole grains, very low sugar, no fruit, plain yogurt, etc. Came down with ?? tendonitis in both knees and shoulders. I still don’t know if I caused this myself with various odd exercises I did in order to relieve back pain, or if I have some other disease causing this (going on two years of this). I did have a positive ANA (maybe a lupus-like thing) and am taking Plaquenil for this. Due to my knees and shoulders problems I am unable to exercise or even take walks. I had cortisone injections in both shoulders two different times last year. Last summer thought I had a UTI – tried all natural methods but finally took a UTI-specific antibiotic for one week (first time on antibiotics in ten years). Still had a feeling of “not quite right” down there and realized it must be yeast. Tried all natural methods and still had symptoms (never any discharge, just itching and burning). Tried two doses of Diflucan after several rounds of OTC yeast infection creams. In November started a stricter, anti-yeast diet gathered from various internet sites. In December, went for kinesiology testing at a chiropractor and took $$$ supplements for yeast but these didn’t help. His questionnaire did help me realize that my hypoglycemic symptoms were probably caused by yeast. Nearly all of the hypoglycemic symptoms disappeared with a stricter no-dairy, no grains diet. I started this forum’s strict diet in early February of this year. Improvements: a few days off and on I have had no symptoms. Most days I have labial itching and vaginal burning (both are mild). Changes for the better: hardly any throat clearing on most days and I can now eat avocado without a stomach ache. I must have had a leaky gut because I couldn’t eat apples, avocados, pears, coconut, or raspberry without a big stomach ache. I’ve only tried the avocados now but they please me and don’t cause cramping – hooray. Possibly related symptoms (?): flaky eyelid, corners of eyes seem mildly infected but they aren’t, eyelid twitching some, skin on palms are rough and dry. These three symptoms are rather recent. I also have bloating after some meals. Typical diet as of this week: soup of homemade organic chicken broth, cabbage or some other greens, okra, green beans, zucchini eaten with 1 T. coconut oil egg scrambled in coconut oil homemade sauerkraut coconut bread eaten warmed up with 1 T. coconut oil brussel sprouts, rutabagas (roasted) avocado, cucumber, green bell pepper, yellow onion, bean sprouts, celery, organic greens (Romaine, kale, cabbages, etc), fresh herbs, with lemon juice and olive oil kefir homemade and setting out 60 hours (24 with grains, 24 hours on counter after that without grains, and 12 more hours) Salmon twice a week I have eaten lots of rutabaga and Brussels sprouts at meals and never had any bad reaction. Actually, I’m not sure I ever had much of a die-off. One day in the first week I had chills in the middle of the night. Another time I had rose hips tea (self-brewed) and I became nauseated right away and vomited once. Other than those times I can’t discern any die off. Supplements/food: Calcium 500 mg/Magnesium 500 mg Dulse seaweed flakes in soup daily for iodine coarse sea salt, black pepper, fresh or dried herbs/spices 150 mcg molybdenum nettle tea (I stopped this as the weather grew warmer here) milk thistle (I stopped this recently) MK-7 Vitamin K-2 (good for bones – it’s found naturally in natto) 1200 mcg folic acid (prevents the sores on my upper palate that I get with my lupus-like thing) Plaquenil 400 mg (for my lupus-like thing) vitamin D 5000 IU Vitamin C 3000 mg Vitamin E 200 IU Vitamin A and D (5000 + 400) Mega Flora 20 billion CFU, twice a day (almost done with this then will move to 50 billion CFU, twice a day) Swedish bitters after meals Thorne SF722 three caps a day (rationing the one bottle I had) Fish oil Nordic Natural ultimate omega on days I don’t eat salmon Zinc 50 mg Selenium 100 mcg Biotin 5 mg [Evening Primose Oil 1000 mg – I have a bottle of this, should I take it?] Coconut oil added to bread and soup. Can’t stand it plain (about 9-10 teaspoons a day + what is baked in the coconut bread) Stopped garlic once I started taking good probiotics. Foods that I thought made my symptoms worse: buckwheat flour, stevia powder, organic chicken, kefir that’s “new” (not fermented enough), too much oat bran (I was loving this with coconut oil but I’m omitting it for now), coconut unsweetened flakes, coconut manna, hemp seeds. After reading all that, do you see anything that I should stop doing, or start doing, or change in some way? I’ve learned so much from you all sharing information. I thank you – you forum regulars, you know who you are – for being willing to help others selflessly. Hallmark"
1,Able900,295,"Hello, Hallmark. Your daily regimen sounds ‘right on’ for the time period, and considering you improvements, it’s definitely time to concentrate on increasing the flora in your intestines so that you can progress further with the treatment. You need to increase the probiotic billions, at least up to 80 billion CFU’s (or anywhere around that amount) a day. You’ll also need to find a way to increase your coconut oil intake once you start concentrating on the flora because this is one factor which helps to change the intestines to a more beneficial environment for the bacteria to multiply. Very few of us enjoyed the coconut oil, and the only way I could get past the taste was to use very warm (almost hot) tea to get it down. Put a teaspoon of the oil in your mouth and follow immediately with a drink of warm tea. It was always easier for me to take it this way if I allowed the coconut oil to thicken in the refrigerator before taking. This has worked for most of the people who have asked me how to get it down without being sick. Since you’re still experiencing bloating after some of your meals, try taking the Swedish bitters about ten minutes before your meals instead of after. Please let me know if this helps. Able"

4,emilylyons22,297,Thanks hope4eva77 and alexalgebra for your suggestions. alexalgebra I have a hard time staying away from fruit since my diet is so restricted and there isn’t much else for me to eat. I’ve already lost 5 lbs on this diet and can’t afford to lose any more weight. What is the protocol you are referring to? I can’t seem to find it.
5,raster,297,"Here is the protocol we developed to get better: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx If you are eating a lot of fruit to start out, this can be problematic. You likely won’t get better if consuming in large amounts. Berries are low in sugar and this is better than high sugar fruits such as pineapple, bananas, etc. You likely were allergic to pineapples, bananas, and nuts because of their sugar content and because they contain a lot of molds (takes weeks for them to get here from the farm). Berries mold fast as well as most other fruits. I generally wouldn’t consume most fruit until you are in stage 3. If you are not eating meat, this can also be problematic because meat is a great source of protein and minerals. If you are not getting the minerals you need this can pose many problems for your recovery. My naturopath who is vegetarian tells all of his customers to eat meat. Some people who are vegetarian get mad and state that they are never coming back. Eventually, years or months later they try out meat and realize it was the missing piece and come back to tell him. If you are eating a bunch of rice this also can be problematic because rice is high in starch, high in the glycemic index, and is inflammatory. If you have leaky gut (you likely do if you have allergies) you need to reduce the inflammation of the gut in order to get better. While fruit does this, rice does not do this. There are reasons carrots, potatoes, and corn are not on the diet and its because each are high in the glycemic index, each are high in starch (which converts to sugar), and each are inflammatory. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5710/2 As an alternative I recommend eating buckwheat which contains only 25% starch, is a prebiotic that feeds the beneficial bacteria in the gut, and has similar texture and taste. Its also a good source of protein. -raster"

Surprised no one has responded to your post.  Its hard to say really, I have found that the probiotics, kefir, etc in their own way produce die off or anti fungal effects, as you strict diet continues, it seems the yeast gets weaker and is more suseptable to the antifungals. there are alot of different anti fungals u can try instead of coconut oil and see if maybe another would work. You may be sensitive to it. Plus too much die off can cause a back up of toxins in your system and then any additional can make u feel horrible. That is my problem, I am infected systemically, and even the slightest antifungal food can be hell. I am having a terrible time trying to find something to help clean out the toxins. So you may just try to back off some, work on removing more toxins and continue on."
3,shannonkv,298,"Thanks for your reply Gtoblade. I’ve cut out the majority of antifungals that I was taking, but notice that even the smallest amount (just for flavouring) can set my stomach off.

0,serenedream,299,"Hi, I just cannot seem to make kefir right. It either comes out looking thinner just like milk but with a different taste (24 hr ferment), or when I warm the liquid and slightly longer than 24 hrs, it looks like the pictures below with chunks/speckles. I am using around 3-4 cups of milk to my kefir grains… if I used more milk, I thought it would just come out more liquid-like. I cannot seem to make the right consistency, which I thought was to be thicker than milk, somewhat sour yogurt-like taste…   I feel beyond stupid that it’s been almost 2 weeks and I’ve barely made more than 1-2 glasses I can consume. I am just wasting milk at this point. When I give it the 24 hours, and it comes out just like milk (but different smell/taste), I worry that it’s not fermented right and full of lactose so I usually throw out instead of drinking.

I’ve been making batches daily, but rarely drink what ferments due to the pictures I’ve shown or I think it’s just too “like milk” and I fear the lactose consumption. Thank you very much for the response."
3,Miriam,299,"Hi, I purchased my grains from cultures for health. They were dehydrated. Have you spoken to the kefirlady to get her suggestion? I wanted to purchase dehydrated grains. I got mine from culturesforhealth.com. The grains you got from the kefirlady were they dehydrated? If not what kind of milk did she use? I know that the grains don’t like to have their milks switched on them. I know this from experience. You can make coconut milk kefir and milk kefir at the same time. When you use coconut milk you do have to at use least one time every 2 weeks use cows milk. The ratio is 20 parts milk to 1 part kefir grains.I never started off with fresh milk grains. Mine have always been dehydrares. I broke the jar with the grains in them and had to get new grains-dehydrated again. With the picture you show I wouldn’t drink them either. Myself I would repurchase new grains from culturefor health. Start over. I don’t like to chance things. Hope this helps. Contact me again if you need to.  Miriam"
4,hdispain,299,It sounds like you are using too much milk. I just got my grains (1 tbsp) and I’m using 1 cup of milk for each 24 hour batch and it comes out perfect. Your grains aren’t big or strong enough at this point for that much milk.
5,Neetah,299,"Hello i am fairly new to making keffir. At first i thought i was doing it all wrong because my grains were very small and my keffir would go all thick and lumpy and they would get lost in it. But the lady i bought them from said that kefir grains vary alot depending on the temp of your house. (my house has been very hot lately) she said to just mix a bit of water into the thick kefir to make it thinner so it will go through the strainer, tapping the side of the strainer with a ceramic mug helps the kefir fall through. For a one litre batch of kefir i usually end up with 2 tablespoons of kefir grains with which i make the next batch. Even if you leave the kefir for a really long time and it looks like cheese vomit apparently its still very good for you. Once you remove the grains you can put the kefir in your blender with a bit of vanilla essence and honey to make it more pallatable (depending on how strict your diet is)"
6,missourifarmgirl,299,I use water keffir is this ok? Made with juice or sugar?
7,jay253,299,"this is what mine looks like and i got my grains locally and they where in milk, mine smells like yeasty cheese ,some say to avoid yeast for candida but why would yeast like yeast nystatin is yeast so maybe those yeast chunks will help out"
8,Miriam,299,"Hi, I don’t put my kefir in the blener ever. I add what ever I want to the kefir but I do it by hand. FYI Your grains may ferment in less than 24 hours. Mine do. I use the blender to break up the fruit. You shouldn’t eat fruit or drink juice on the Protocol diet. Let that come later when you are adding foods back into your diet. On the water kefir you want to use sugar water not juice. Rapadura is a great sugar. I mix my sugars using 2 different sugars in batch. Hope this helps, Miriam"
0,Cheesey,300,"Hi Folks So I’m 12 weeks into the website diet now and it has been a bit of a roller-coaster. Severe die-off lasted for a long time. Looking back at it now this is probably because I made so many mistakes and really battered myself into the ground at a very early stage then continued to go hard on myself. I’ll give you a low down on my symptoms first. This list is a comparison to week 1 or 2 of the diet rather than to before I started on all of this. Symptoms that have almost/entirely disappeared: Dizziness Any stomach/BM issues Panic attacks Rashes Bad breath Jaw tension Irritability Sinus issues Mood swings My weight is back to what it was pre-diet (that’s a good thing) Symptoms that are still there but diminished: Anxiety/’Pure-o’ OCD Fatigue Muscle weakness/aching Brain fog Feeling generally ‘weird’  Frothy urine Spaced out feelings Restlessness Teeth/face pressure (potentially something dental and unrelated) This looks like good progress, however, I am still worse than before I started the diet. Fatigue was and is still my main thing to contend with. It is considerably better as compared to, for instance, a month ago when I could hardly make it out the house. However, it’s still persisting and its not clear why. I go on frequent walks but if I go too far I really start to feel wobbly on my legs and my tonsils will swell up. I have now been referred to a CFS specialist that I am seeing later this month. I think the tonsil issue is something perhaps independent of the candida and maybe holding me back. For the past 9 months I have had chronic viral tonsillitis that is somewhat unidentifiable to the doctors. I often see correlations between how my throat is and how my other symptoms are doing. I’m still not back at work. I went in a couple of times recently for about 4 hours but afterwards I was so exhausted and it would take me more than 24 hours to recover. As I mentioned earlier, I am on the website diet (plus green lentils). As some of you may know, I can’t justify to myself, my girlfriend and my family doing the forum diet, moreover my ND thinks it is unnecessary as candida will feed on protein if it has to (her words). I eat a lot of veg and usually have good BMs on average twice a day. I eat red meat once or twice a week (usually lamb). Other than that I eat fish, chicken, duck and eggs. As for carbs, I eat oat bran, quinoa, brown rice, green lentils and millet. My current supplements are as follows: Morning 2 x Colostrum 2 x S. Boulardii 1 x Ashwaganda 1 x Now Silymarin 1 x Now Omega 3 1 x 10 x 50bn probiotic Evening 2 x Colostrum 2 x S. Boulardii 1 x Ashwaganda 1 x Now Silymarin 1 x Now Omega 3 1 x Vitamin D3 1 x Pint of Kefir Finally, I am currently waiting for the results of a adrenal and SIgA saliva test. A few questions: Can anyone see anything that I might be doing that may require change/have general input? They say die-off should last no more than a month but that recovery can take 6-18 months. What are symptoms doing in the meantime? What are other people’s experiences of fatigue after about 3 months of the diet?"
1,Monte,300,"Wow, with the exception of frothy urine, you’ve posted my EXACT symptoms/issues! I will be curious to see what anyone else says about this… The fatigue is just brutal. I’ve done training at the Mayo Clinic for CFS and Fibromyalgia. Seen Dr’s for a throat issue. Really, I hope others have some explanations/answers for you!"

You wouldn’t have to eliminate meat all together, just eat it two times a week, and get rid of brown rice, quinoa and millet, but you can replace those by buckwheat, oat bran and coconut flour, and also eat a lot of eggs during the day. It can be doable, but if you don’t have the needed support I can see how it can be hard. As far as for the weight loss goes, I may not be the best example, but I actually gained weight while on the diet, so everything’s possible 😉 Are you taking coconut oil? It’s a great antifungal, so you might try it if you aren’t using it already. I’m 5 months into the diet and also feel fatigued from time to time, sometimes I don’t have the strength to climb the stairs or do my yoga class, but I’m working 8 hours a day, so I suppose my fatigue is ok comparing to yours if you even can’t go to work."

Just to be sure all the new members understand you; you are not on the forum diet or protocol, but rather you’re following the website’s diet. So it looks like you have two choices; on the one hand, you have the support of your girlfriend/family and keeping your present weight, and the second choice is to suffer indefinitely from a Candida infestation in your body, and you’ve apparently chosen the infestation. Considering the fact that, every single day you’re feeding the Candida foods that ensure their survival and foods that are making sure that their environment is in perfect condition for them to multiply, I think you’re doing amazingly well to have eliminated or almost eliminated as many symptoms as you have. You should honestly consider yourself very fortunate instead of wondering why you’re not any better than you are. In your shoes, I wouldn’t expect to improve past the point of where you are right now … again, considering the treatment you’re on. Able"
6,Cheesey,300,"I appreciate you all taking your time to read and respond to my thread. As you have drawn my attention to my good progress, I can’t see any evidence in my own circumstance that indicates the strict forum diet and protocol is a necessary addition to my current plan. I might reconsider in the future if, as you say, Able, I plateau and fail to produce further progress. However, at the moment results are continuing to materialise, albeit at a rate slower than I might have liked. Perhaps I need to cultivate greater patience rather than implement a new dietary protocol. Keya, thanks for your ideas re: coconut oil. Unfortunately, I’m not certain that making this addition to my diet would be a good idea as I am taking S. Boulardii which is actually a yeast. I wouldn’t want to simultaneously kill the S. Boulardii as I am trying to us it to kill the Candida. I think as well perhaps I am not strictly too ill to be in work, it is just that in the past I would keep pushing and pushing and in the end I would burn out. Both my doctor and the occupational healthcare team recommend that I continue to stay off work. It is a bit of a strange one because I used to try to work through feeling like crap but at the moment I am letting my body guide me and tell me when I need rest, so I’m never really getting to the point of absolute exhaustion. I am incredibly lucky in that the division of the company I work for is actually extremely quiet at the moment and also has extremely good employee care system. Again, thank you all for your time and effort in responding."

1,Kag,301,"I wouldn’t add any supplements to a drink that contains citric acid and carbonation. I would think these properties would reduce the efficacy of your supplement or antifungal. Also, I don’t think that caramel color is very good for you but I can’t remember why it is bad. Also, erithryitol is a an alcohol sugar and there is some disagreement on here as to whether it is okay. And lastly, natural flavors, you just never know what that could mean. 🙂"
2,Danny33,301,"They don’t look that bad but keep in mind some of those ingredients are on the border. ERYTHRITOL should be okay but I wouldn’t start off my treatment with it. CITRIC ACID – may be derived from yeast CAFFEINE – Should not really be consumed at all during treatment NATURAL FLAVORS – Should be okay, but it could also mean beaver anus (This is a real “natural flavor”, google it, im not joking!)"

5,lifeprincipal,302,I use two probiotic supplements that don’t require refrigeration and they seem to work quite well. One is Jarro-Dophilus EPS & the other is Bio-Kult. I believe they use a highly advanced freeze drying process similar to what is used in preserving allicin in freeze dried garlic capsules. Read the reviews for both products on Amazon and you’ll realize that refrigeration isn’t completely necessary for a probiotic to be effective.
6,serenedream,302," http://www.probiotic-myths.com/default.aspx According to the link, Myth #1 states yogurt is a bad/ineffective probiotic food source. If that is the case, why is it promoted on the anti-candida diet since it does contains sugar? I thought the pros (probiotic/protein) outweighed the cons (sugar content) of yogurt."
0,oh_livia,303,"If you’re like me, on Stage One of the diet, you’re really enjoying your oat bran and kasha as some of the only things you eat to give you that satisfied feeling. I was cooking them normally until I realized how critical it is to soak them before hand! For oat bran especially, continued consumption over time can actually harm your digestive tract and encourage things like IBS. There is a lot of phytates (aka anti-nutrients) in oat bran, which inhibit calcium and other nutrients from getting absorbed in your intestines. Furthermore, it has gluten, which is very difficult to digest. Don’t be alarmed, oat bran is still incredibly beneficial to gut bacteria and eliminating candida, you just have to soak it first! Soaking oat bran: combine oat bran with at least 1 tbs of kasha or buckwheat flour (this encourages more pre-digestion of the bad stuff) add at least 1 tbs of kefir, apple cider vinegar, or lemon juice (it needs an acedic agent). I like to soak mine in just kefir for a nice creamy treat. fill the rest with water and let sit at room temperature 24 hours. when done, you can either rinse it or just add stevia, cinnamon, salt, and coconut oil to enjoy! Kasha is easier on your digestive system and only needs to be soaked 7 hours. different processes for soaking kasha, flours, beans, seeds, and nuts: http://www.healingnaturallybybee.com/articles/foods18.php#a5 Benefits of oat bran: http://www.easyvigour.net.nz/diettoxin/hoatbranstory.htm"
1,Belganson,303,"This is just too much. How the heck am I going to stay home and cook nuts for a minimum of 12 hrs in an oven? I feel like just getting the right foods is extremely difficult enough and now I have to precisely soak everything and cook it exactly right. If that’s so, I would have to give up. I already spend too much time in the kitchen preparing not so yummy meals."
2,dforbreakfast,303,"What if I’m allergic to buckwheat? @Belganson… I hear you. I started this madness about 3 months ago and it has been a full-time job. Buying all the special ingredients, preparing all your own meals, getting all the right supplements, TAKING the supplements at the correct moments during the day… It gets incredibly overwhelming. At a time when you’re already down, the “cure” is a stressful kick in the head on top of it all. All I can say is.. what I try to remind myself in times when it seems too much. I try to frame it as a lifestyle change, instead of just a series of new shit I have to worry about. Change takes time and patience. When your health is at stake, your priorities need to change. The changes seem tedious and ridiculous at first, but over time they become just part of your routine. And every time I feel like giving up, I just tell myself “That’s three months of work you’d be throwing away. And maybe this time next year, you’ll be feeling much better.” I find these thoughts to be enough to keep me going (grudgingly)."
3,oh_livia,303,"For me it’s soak if I remember, don’t fret if I don’t. You can also soak for less time and it will help a lot. And soaking in water is better than nothing. You don’t need the buckwheat/kasha added in if you are allergic, it just helps. If you eat oat bran for breakfast every day, just put it in water, stevia, cinnamon (With the extra helpful stuff if you have it quickly on hand) before bed and then you’ll actually have it to go in the morning. Here’s an article about which things might be more meaningful to soak and which things aren’t as dire: http://nutritiondiva.quickanddirtytips.com/phytic-acid-in-grains.aspx From what I have read elsewhere though, oats are especially important to soak, and even more so if you eat them regularly. We are overworked now and that is why we don’t have time for our health. People in the past did spend a lot of the day in the kitchen and the garden preparing food. There are ways to be healthy and somewhat fast now, but you have to be creative. I’ve also really grown to love my kitchen time lately. Just do you best and enjoy what you do for your health."
4,raster,303,"I’ve been mentioning this over and over on the forum, atleast with nuts and seeds! If you decide to eat nuts and seeds it will contain molds which exist on dry food items.

Finally gave in and had my Dr.do an  exam….ugh. She diagnosed yeast infection. Gave me Diflucan and an antifungal  topical. That didn’t help. Dr. then gave me script for Nystatin powder to apply.  That didn’t help. So……just been living with it. I know it’s Candida. I have  a few other symptoms… Itchy inner ears always at night. Horrible morning  breath, mouth tastes like metal and occasionally ammonia. So……. My question  is Does anyone else have an itchy burning anus. And if so HOW do you get relief?

Topically I was told by a dermatologist to combine an antifungal cream, vaginal cream and she gave me a script for hydrocortisone. It helps but not long term. I am also trying ozonated olive oil.

6,pahvantpiper,304,"Julie, I’ve struggled with the same problem for over 20 years. I am just now starting the strict diet as soon as I receive some of my supplements. But, what has helped me with the itching has been wet wipes. I just make sure things are wiped clean a couple times a day and I get by fine. This only helps temporarily (several hours) but it does help. On a couple occasions I’ve been asked why I carry wet wipes around with me. 🙂"
7,Belganson,304,I had a doctor tell me specifically no wet wipes. Also no scented soaps. I would guess it would be a wonderful idea to throw away your underwear and get all new pair as I am certain the yeast lives in them. I’ve been told that microwaving your underwear would kill the yeast but I am not sold on putting my underwear anywhere near my food sources.
8,slate01,304,"Hi love47, I have had an itchy anus for the last 22 years or so (i first noticed it when i was 14), also caused by a chronic candida infection. The reason the drugs that your Dr prescribed don’t work is because they are unable to affect the form of candida that we all have. Unfortunately candida under certain circumstances forms a fungal biofilm, which permanently adheres to the intestinal lining (unless you use some sort of agent to strip it). Diflucan, nystatin and most other pharmaceuticals are ineffective against biofilms, as many studies have shown. People that have this biofilm expel some sort of slime/mucus that is either part of the biofilm itself or a waste product that makes its way down the small and large intestine and causes sever itching around the perianal skin. A gastroenterologist I saw last year said that he thought the slime was mucus produced by my body to defend against some sort of infection (he didnt believe in candida) and that this mucus is alkaline and therefore irritates the anus as the perianal skin has an acidic pH of about 5 or 6 and would react to any alkaline substance coming into contact with it. This actually fits with the whole idea that candida causes the itching however, as a study has shown that the benign yeast(planktonic) form of candida becomes fungal by creating a highly alkaline environment through the production of ammonia. So the itching is really just a symptom of the candida having created its preferred environment (an alkaline fungal biofilm). http://mbio.asm.org/content/2/3/e00055-11.full If you think about it the only way it could create such an alkaline environment would be if the acid forming bacteria were no longer there to maintain the acidic pH of the intestines and keep the candida in its more benign yeast form. This is possible through the use of antibiotics. The yeast has a window of opportunity to become fungal and then once this happens it spreads like wildfire, making more and more of the intestines alkaline as it goes. ACV enemas can help to some extent in that they create a break in the constant stream of itchy slime making its way down to the anus, however they arent a cure as the biofilm is most likely also in the small intestine and therefore cant be reached by an enema. The ACV will also allow you to have a good look at what is causing the itching. Anyway sorry for the long post. Let me know if you’d like a list of the antibiofilm herbs I use. They seem to be working, but the longer you’ve had it the longer it takes. Love47, if you’ve only had this since last year it prob wouldnt take too long. Cheers."
9,Belganson,304,I am interested in knowing what helped you. I have had the problem for 2+ yrs.
10,Love47,304,"Wow Slate!!!!! Thanks for that super informative post!!!!!!!! That makes SO much sense. Of course, PLEASE I would like to know what herbs you take.  Julie"
11,CaliCandidaHelp,304,"Hi. I have the same problem.. I use Caladryl Clear Lotion sometimes to bear with itch. If you been scratching it till it bleeds you might want to wait till it heals a little bit otherwise it might burn. Sometimes the burn is better than that unbarring itch. It worked pretty good for me so far. You can also try to put few drops of Oregano Oil on the cotton pads and put a little bit of water on it so its kinda mixed. Apply that to itchy areas but beware, IT WILL BURN & HEART A LOT (you will be jumping all over the place) for about 10 minutes, you will forget all about that itch for quite some time tho and it will feel ok once it stop burning.

13,Love47,304,Slate?? Please come back!!!!
14,Able900,304,"Julie, what Slate is talking about is basically changing the environment of the intestines back to its normal acidic ph. This is done by first lowering the number of Candida yeast in the intestines with a proper diet and antifungals. Shortly after starting this protocol, homemade kefir and probiotics are added to the mix. This is what will eventually change the pH environment where the Candida were previously living in bliss in the alkaline environment which we helped them create with bad diets and antibiotics. The Protocol on the forum which includes a well planned Candida diet is basically what the forum members are using to treat their infestations in the manner I just described. Able"

0,NovusOrdo,306,"Hey, so I’m totally new to this whole thing and I’m deeply saddened by it. Mainly because I’m a vegetarian (9 years strong), and the idea of going back to what I’ve viewed as morally wrong (eating meat) is a difficult one to confront. However, for my health, I have chosen to take this diet extremely seriously and will do what I can to ensure I have no future issues. That leads me to my questions. I started doing the diet in a very half-assed way and, needless to say, the warnings that I should have read before hand (about the dying yeast releasing a toxic gas that causes fuzziness, depression and does a number on my liver) were quite on point. So, I went ahead and ordered those vitamins that are necessary to help combat those effects (as well as multivitamins that are safe for a candida diet). Since I won’t be able to begin this diet until I receive those items, I’d appreciate any advice I can get about what I should be eating/doing before I begin for real, this time. I’ve been drinking lots of kombucha and eating plenty of plain greek yogurt (nothing to complain about :)), but I know there has to be more. EDIT: I’ve been taking lots of niacin, iron, vitamin C and B12, as well. And once I begin this diet, should I stick with eating meat after the duration of the 5 month period? Can I ever go back to being a vegetarian? I understand the pitfall of going back is falling back onto old habits, but is the risk more than just that? I’m coping with dropping my diet for another, but do I have an extremely strict eating regimen to look forward to for the rest of my days? I suppose I’m used to restrictions due to my vegetarian diet, but I’ve never had to keep track of what I’ve been eating (how much/when/etc). I know that I probably should have been doing that, but excuses excuses. Thank you for any help I can get and, above all else, I’m glad a resource like this exists. The scare of getting oral thrush was enough to convince me to take this as seriously as possible. Thanks again."
1,Kag,306,"Hey Novus, I am not a vegetarian but I know that there are people on this site who are. Hopefully one of them will chime in with advice. I relied heavily on eggs for my protein because I am not a big meat eater. I think if you go with eggs and lots of veggies, you would be okay. You are getting calories from the yogurt as well. You should probably message Able for the diet. I don’t think meat is allowed in the first part of the diet. I managed to keep my weight up with almond butter but it isn’t part of the strict diet. I would reach out to Able as to who on here is a vegetarian as well. I don’t think it is impossible to do the diet as a vegetarian."
2,NovusOrdo,306,"Thank you for your reply. I assume Able is a seasoned veteran of the diet and user of this board? I read that being a vegetarian on this diet is next to impossible due to the fact that many proteins in a vegetarian diet are verbotten under the Candida diet. However, I always seem to find something new about this diet that, thankfully, is happening before I dive into this thing. So no meat for the first part of the diet? I’m glad that the yogurt and kombucha was a good call. Not just because I love that stuff, but because I did notice a drastic change on my tongue after consuming that stuff for a few weeks every day (less white spots). Again, thank you for the help!"
3,Kag,306,"The first stage of the diet is very strict. It is designed to kill the yeast overgrowth rapidly and also filter out food allergies if you have them. You will lose weight on it if you keep to it, whether or not you are a vegetarian. I think that you could get by with eggs though. Also, I can’t remember, is spirulina allowed with veg. diet? There are also things on the second stage of the diet like coconut bread that is very filling and tasty. You should message Able for the strict diet protocol if you are interested. He is very knowledgeable and helped me a lot. Like I said, just about the only thing I didn’t follow on the diet was the almond butter. I have a very physical job at time and just needed the energy. However, nuts are said to be “fungusy” 🙂 and therefore not good for yeast overgrowth."
4,Lordshelpr,306,"May I chime in here and say that I am very interested in this too as I really don’t like eating meat either,but like you say, NovusOrdo, it’s about restoring health. I am also getting ready to do the cleanse. I’s like to know………are there ANY nuts that are allowed on the diet?"

As far as protein sources on the stricter diet are concerned; organic eggs and organic hemp seeds or hemp seed powder should be  your first choices. Your second choice should be organic chicken as well as young fish which are sustainable, and certified by MSC  (Marine Stewardship Council). But no one is going to tell you that you have to eat either one of these. Red meat shouldn’t be a concern for you on the diet; because of the ammonia production, beef and pork are both detrimental to a Candida treatment and should not be eaten at all. The forum members, Alexalgebra and Shayfo, are vegetarian/vegan who are treating Candida. Just key their names in the search area  and you should be able to find some of their posts. If either of you would like to have the link to the forum diet, just let me know via private message on the forum. Able"
0,shannonkv,307,"Sorry if this has been asked, but I could not find any information. I was reading that garlic should not be taken (post high doses of antfungals at the beginning) because it is a natural antibiotic and therefore helps feed the yeast. I will post the link to the information if I can find it…should have saved the link! I had been incorporating garlic cloves into my diet as I thought this was a positive…I’m now wondering if this has had the opposite affect? Thanks."
1,Kag,307,There was a thread about this but I can’t remember if it was ever fully answered for me. I still take garlic because I feel it is good for you. I also take a strong probiotic as well at a different time of the day so maybe they even each other out… I don’t know…
0,lou bear,308,I know we can eat fresh tomatoes but was wondering if tinned were ok aswel?

0,Loci,309,"Last summer I was diagnosed with candida albicans in my gut. I was put on nystatin and followed the diet to a T for 16 weeks. I was really proud of myself for doing so well and cleared the candida and was given a clean bill of health. Because I was clear of it, I started to eat crappy again. What started out as a slice of cake here, and a piece of pizza there (while eating extremely healthy otherwise), turned into ice cream cravings every day! I would have to eat my gluten free cookies every night or have some ice cream. It got so bad that I knew inside what I was doing to myself and sure enough, the symptoms started to pop up slowly…..one day it was fatigue……next day I was fine…..then I’d have headaches and backaches…..the next day fine……then my eyes would get red or I’d get bloated……etc. So I went back to my doc and without him even testing me, he knew it was back. So this time he put my on fluconazole (every day for first month, every other for the 2nd month, and every 3rd day) + very strict diet! I was back at square one. The first two weeks I was awful. One day, I not only had Starbucks with whole milk, but I ate a DOUGHNUT! Something I haven’t eaten for probably over 10 years. Then that same day the cravings were so bad I took my kids out for ice cream after school!!!! I felt so ashamed of myself and the lack of control and that day was the last straw! The following morning, I woke up and was determined. The next 2 weeks following, I was SUPER strict…..and then…..I started to cheat again this last week. Just “one” coffee! Just one drink for my birthday. Just one piece of fruit. Just one handful of M&Ms. Today I was doing very well until I made my child a bagel and I ate HALF of it. I don’t know what is going on with me this time. Maybe I feel like it’s not as severe as last time so I have “wiggle” room, but I know that’s farthest from the truth. I know I am feeding the candida. Today I am sluggish, irritated, dizzy, my eye is red, I am bloated, I am broken out. I need some encouragement here. To top it off, we are taking our kids to Disneyland on Monday for a week. A part of me is saying “just cheat for one more week and get back on track when you get back”, but I know I am causing so much harm to my body, not only in feeding the candida, but in taking these heavy meds that are NOT good for the liver. Any advice? Why can’t I stick to this diet like I did last time?"
1,raster,309,"I would consider better/healthier cheat items such as fruit as an alternative. The coffee with cream isn’t all that bad once in awhile from my experience but the other things you listed can cause multiple day setbacks or more. Eating a piece of fruit on the other hand shouldn’t cause much of a setback because it is digested easily. I would also consider specific supplements to deal with cravings such as L-glutamine, etc. Your body might be getting the proper nutrition that it needs, so it is crying out for more. For instance, it might really be craving trace minerals but it tells your body that you need food. Or vitamin E. Just using examples… -raster"
2,Loci,309,"That actually makes a lot of sense. I never really considered that. I currently take cod liver oil, probiotics and FemRebalance (for my hormonal fluctuations), but I can say that I am probably not consuming the vitamins and minerals I need on a day to day basis. I will try my best to stick to what I can while on vacation. I can always order peppermint or chamomile tea. I will definitely miss my coconut milk. That really helps keep me off the dairy. I just wish these fluctuations weren’t so common. I thought for sure after my first two horrible weeks, and then my next two really good weeks, that I would be more on board and not craving as much. Is it true that once you start eating anything you’re not supposed to that the candida can get so out of control again that you technically start all over? Or does it just cause a minor “flare up?”"
3,Kag,309,"I am curious why you have to go off of coconut milk? I would think that would be okay as long as it is not sweetened. I have experienced this problem as well. I have been on the diet for several month and have been doing oil-pulling in my mouth. I had a chocolate bar last week and then ate out this last weekend. And then, low and behold, the lips start burning on Tuesday… smh… it is so aggravating!! I would like to know, from you as well as others, how do you find doctors willing to prescribe so much diflucan for you? The most I ever had a doctor be willing to prescribe to me was three to be taken over a week’s period and that was for a vaginal yeast infection. I can’t even find a doctor that is willing to admit that this IS yeast, much less prescribe something other than cream, and I had the cracks in the corners of my mouth last year which is known to be caused by yeast. I would love to know this because at this point, I might want to try diflucan on a regular basis, it always cured my vaginal yeast. I am not saying that I will go off the diet, because I definitely feel better physically and emotionally on it, but I have completely had it with my lips burning all the time! Thanks in advance for your answers!"
4,shayfo,309,"One of the really great things about Disneyland is that they let you bring in your own food. I would suggest baking ahead of time and taking muffins, breads, or cookies made out of the approved grains, and something calorie/nutrient-dense like a buckwheat groat salad with veggies. Hardboiled eggs are also small and portable. Another forum member and I went to Disneyland for his birthday, and we both packed a bunch of food and got through it cheat-free. My other recommendation would be to think of the desire to deviate from the diet moment-to-moment. If I think, “I will get to eat a piece of chocolate again in three or four months,” my impulse is a mild freak-out and feeling sort of trapped by the diet. But when I think, “I’m not eating a piece of chocolate right now,” that’s not as hard…so I just have to think “right now” about everything. It’s hard stuff, but being strict is self-reinforcing after a while, because you start to feel so much better, and you gain confidence in your self-discipline. Good luck!"

First, I have to say that this is exactly why I wish some of the experts and members would stop telling the new members that a ‘little’ cheat now and then isn’t going to make that much difference. As you can see from Jo’s post, telling someone that cheating occasionally is actually good for your morale (or any other reason) is very bad advice. Jo mistakenly had one teaspoon of milk and now her treatment has been set back approximately six weeks, and it could take her another six weeks to get back to where she was at Christmas. Meanwhile, what’s happening? Well if you ask Jo, she’ll probably tell you that her morale isn’t so great right now and that she’s suffering physically. The point is; we do not know how badly a cheat or a mistake, no matter how small it is, is going to affect a member because it’s simply impossible to predict such a thing with individuals."
6,hope4eva77,309,"well i am right where u are with this ,i have been stuck in a viscous cycle of starting the diet and then stopping it for 3 months !i think if we focus on the lil things like playing with our kids and giving hugs and music anything else that makes us happy it will be easier but this is hard as hell no matter what ! what shayfo said is good just focus on the moment and not that it will be a long while before we can have a food . i honestly must say i never knew how emotionally connected to food i am untill now ,i have a sugar addiction just like any drug and it has to end today .i know the feeling of being determined and then a slip up happens leading to more and more destructive behavior .its aweful . its true everyone’s different we dont know how much one is going to be set back from fruit or any other food it has to be an individual decision to add fruit .i think a green apple every few days or blue berries will b ok with me as i dont react to them ,i react mainly to anything high in sugar or real starchy but i dont want to eat fruit everyday cuz i want a cure and im scared it may prolong that . goodluck we can do this !"

Hope, I live in CT too! I totally can relate to the emotional ties with food. When stressed, anxious, or depressed, it is much easier for me to reach for a Ben and Jerry’s pint than discuss my problems. I used to figure that I exercise daily, rarely drink, don’t smoke or do drugs, so what’s wrong with weekly indulgence? When I met my boyfriend, he was a moderate marijuana user and got me using it very casually. However, when we would smoke, talk about food binges and willpower out the window! All that evaporated and I would literally eat anything good I could find. This short pattern certainly abetted my current overgrowth. I agree, and hope that down the road a few months from now a slice of green apple or berries will be okay. That’s the tough part.. knowing that fruit is what mother nature provided us to eat and is labeled as eating clean and healthy, but regardless, its forbidden. I will do what it takes to overcome the overgrowth and who knows, maybe 6 months from now a few berries in my oat bran may be a possibility!"
9,hope4eva77,309,I am back at square one and having a few berries in my oatbran just not everyday I also decided on almond butter and veggie crackers and sum brown rice pasta once a wk or so. I have found I am worse off than before I started right now with all my symptoms out of control. I am now determined to get back on track. I don’t see how a that small amount of milk would cause so much maybe it was something else going on with her. Regardless everyone is different and that comes right down to how strict we can b with diet but I do think it will probably take me a full year from now to heal and even then I should keep in mind a much healthier diet.

I doubt that it was the sugar content that hurt her. She may have an allergy or leaky gut intolerance to dairy that’s gotten more sensitive as her candida has been dying (it can leave even bigger holes in the intestines for a while as the “roots” die). My gluten allergy is extremely sensitive. I once ate some asparagus at a friend’s BBQ that had a pretty light amount of garlic salt that contained modified food starch (made of wheat) on it, and I was feeling repercussions for three weeks thereafter. Needless to say, I started checking the ingredients on everyone’s seasoning salts after that."
11,Loci,309,"Kag, To answer your questions: Why can’t you have coconut milk? I do drink unsweetened coconut milk, but I meant next week will be hard while on vacation as it’s hard to come by coconut milk. Seems like cow’s milk and soy milk are the only options. Sounds like Disneyland is pretty good about letting people bring food in so that is a HUGE plus!!!!!!! With regards to diflucan. I see a yeast specialist. He’s located here in Colorado (Dr. Nicolas Nonas). I’m not big on taking Rx drugs though and for long period of time, but in order to help kill the yeast I will take it at this point. My liver function is totally fine so I just keep an eye on that. I also think probiotics are a HUGE plus. I can see a noticeable difference if I forget to take my probiotics."
12,Loci,309,"Hope4eva77, I don’t think I have it as severe as I did last time. For me, 1 tsp of milk will not affect me in anyway (as someone posted above). A handful of M&Ms, well that’s a different story. However, I am not condoning cheating in any way. What works for one person, will not work for someone else. For instance, a dessert I have often is green apple chopped, with cinnamon, oats and some xylitol. It does not affect me in any way. I also have plain yogurt with coconut and xylitol. It definitely helps curb my sugar cravings. Not to mention I have a FABULOUS candida free chocolate cake recipe. It’s heaven. I just haven’t made it recently because we’re leaving on vacation, so I turned to chocolate instead. I don’t know why this time I cannot stop cheating. Last time I was super strict. Killed the candida and was cured of symptoms I carried for 4 years!!!!! This time, I just keep telling myself it’s only a couple day set back, when in reality I know I am doing MUCH more damage. Today is a new day. I started the day out great. Maybe we need to start some kind of daily check in. The great thing is, once you give up the sugar, you will stop craving it. The candida is causing these intense sugar cravings. I remember that after about 2 weeks last time. I had no desire to eat sugar because my body was killing the candida. I just need to keep telling myself that!"

0,shannonkv,310,"Sorry to beat a dead horse here, but I am looking for clarification. I have been on the candida diet for a little over 2 months now (wow, feels so much longer!) and have noticed small improvements, such as waking up on the weekends at a decent time, instead of late morning/ noon and not feeling exhausted by 6pm during the work week. On Monday I started feeling die off symptoms again, which I have not had for several weeks now. I had been taking several antifungals, but have since switched over to probiotics – 50 billion with 10 strains and a seperate probiotic with just DDS-1.

Is it normal to experience a second round of semi-severe die off? (headaches, sick stomach, ear ache, sore throat/ chest). My diet has been fairly strict I believe: eggs, veggie smoothies (made of lettuce, italian parsley and/ or spinach, lemon juice, water), probiotic yogurt with flax seed, eggs, cucumber, brown rice and a few times a week chicken (some grain fed/ some not) and the homemade cookies as mentioned above. Thanks for the help!"

I had been taking several antifungals, but have since switched over to probiotics – 50 billion with 10 strains and a separate probiotic with just DDS-1. Your new die-off experience is due to the addition of the DDS-1 bacteria strain. This is a very powerful strain against Candida, especially when you first start using it.The antifungals I am taking are in homemade cookies, containing oat bran, buckwheat flour, coconut flour, coconut oil, eggs and cinnamon. These cookies are not so much an antifungal, but rather they’re a very good prebiotic. This means that the cookies are feeding the beneficial bacteria (including the DDS1 strain) which in turn are helping them to multiply, so definitely continue with these. Prebiotics can sometimes cause the bacteria to increase enough to cause more die-off.I’m just wondering was it too soon to cut back on the antifungals; should I be taking more antifungals in addition to the probiotics at this point? Since the cookies are not an antifungal, you should continue to eat these every day. Are you on any other antifungal supplement? You didn’t mention taking virgin coconut oil by the teaspoon. If you’re not doing this, then you should be. Start with one teaspoon a day and add another one every two to three days depending on the die-off symptoms. Are you taking Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate and Candidate by Native Remedies for the die-off toxins? You should also drink a lot of water during the die-off episodes to wash the toxins from your body; in fact, you should drink a lot of water throughout your treatment.Is it normal to experience a second round of semi-severe die off? (headaches, sick stomach, ear ache, sore throat/ chest). It’s perfectly normal, especially if you add or change something in the treatment such as you have by adding the DDS-1 strain of bacteria. Sounds like you’re doing well if you’re staying on the strict diet. Cheating can also cause die-off because it allows the Candida to multiply; therefore you have more Candida to kill and cause the die-off to increase. Able"

In hindsight I also got this while taking the Caprin but at the time had a bad cold so didn’t put two and two together. Are these symptoms die-off?

Since realizing I have mild candida, I stopped the Advair as I believe it was a contributor to oral thrush and dry mouth. In my experience, Asthma symptoms are most definitely a symptom of die-off. Do you smoke? I think a prescription anti-fungal like Diflucan is strong thus producing a more intense die off, and if you are taking probiotics, that probably is as well. I used to have constant mucous, but I went very slow with adding antifungal (coconut oil) because asthma symptoms are no fun. I have an Albuterol inhaler (that I try not to take), but that will definitely help the chest tightness and shortness of breath. I would talk with your doctor and explain what you are feeling since taking his prescription. He may give you a temporary inhaler until your die off lessens. Make sure you are taking MAAC and/or Milk Thistle. It should and would get better, especially if you have no prior history of asthma. Good luck!"
2,raster,311,"What is happening is the toxins are going from detoxing via the skin to detoxing via the lungs. I talked to my naturopath about this at length and he said if the toxins are not being released from the body, then it builds up and effects one of the ways you detox. You detox via 3 basic methods, via the skin, the lungs, and the bowels. I would check out these posts: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590 http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst2981_DieOff-Without-Molybdenum.aspx http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm9759_DieOff-Symptoms-and-Cure.aspx#post9759 http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst3012_Possible-alternative-to-molybdenum–Juniper-Berry-Extract.aspx http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst4116_The-benefits-of-sweating-out-toxins-mineral-water-and-minerals.aspx and http://drlwilson.com/detox_protocols.htm -raster"
3,blt212,311,"Thank you for the information. I am not a smoker and don’t usually get asthma. I do have Milk Thistle, Standardized Silymarin Extract 30:1, 150mg pills. How many of these should I take a day and when? As for the Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate, I will see if I can obtain at my local vitamin and health food store. I’m a bit hesitant to add too many pills at once because when I do this it seems to bring on more issues. Are these any side effects to the Molybdenum? I have not taken the diflucan yet today. It’s seem like the breathing/tightness problem is worse in the morning and has subsided a bit after taking an epsom salt bath. I think I might cut the dose of the diflucan in half until I get this die off under control. Do you think this is wise?"
4,shayfo,311,"To the best of my knowledge, the only side effect associated with MAAC is some demineralization with long-term use. To avoid this, you can drink nettle tea, which will help keep copper levels balanced."
5,raster,311,"Chelated molybdenum chelates minerals from the body like shayfo mentioned; it chelates both the good and bad minerals. If you supplement yourself with trace minerals, this should reduce the mineral loss. I would take 400-600mg of milk thistle per day between meals and space out the dose. -raster"
6,Kag,311,"I think that you should stick with the dose that your doctor recommends. You don’t want the yeast to become resistant. Also, I would try hot baths and showers, or maybe even sticking your head with a towel over a pot of boiling water. I think getting some steam into your lungs might help. Also, and I don’t know about the chemicals in it but metholyptus ointment has always helped me when my chest gets tight. It is stinky, but it might help you breathe easier. Definitely go with something that will support your liver, that will help die-off."
7,blt212,311,"Thank you everyone….I am feeling better this evening. I took the Milk Thistle…unfortunately the Health Food Store I went to did not have MACC….they recommended an Enzyme called Candec, I think it was called, to be taken in between meals. I didn’t get it because I told her about enzyme the ND gave me called Transformizyme by Metamorphosis and she said that would be good, it contains: Amylase 1830 BAU Alpha Amylase 100 DU Glucoamylase 30 AGU Lactase 1500 ALU Sucrase 135 INVU Maltase 200 DP Pullulanase 25 PUN Cellulase 500 CU Hemicellulase 200 HSU She said to take one between meals and it’s supposed to help with the toxins. Hopefully she’s right. Also what’s the thought on a hot tub…we don’t really over chlorinate…would be it useful too?"
8,Kag,311,"I think a hot tub sounds like a great idea, don’t know about the chemicals in the water though… I would be more like to go with a really hot bath to steam up your bathroom so you don’t breath chlorine in."
9,blt212,311,"Good Point about the chlorine, there is definitely some in there. One last question, I think 🙂 Should I continue taking the Probiotic Saccharomyces Boulardii while taking the Diflucan, I was told as long as you take them at least 2 hours apart it would be ok but I don’t want the die-off to be worse if I take the Probiotic too."
10,Kag,311,"I don’t know. You may want to get someone more knowledgable to answer that. I take a probiotic with 50 million in it, but I don’t take that one so I don’t know. I think you should definitely be taking a probiotic if you are taking diflucan. To tell you the truth, I think MOST of us should be taking a probiotic, even healthy people. We just take so many medicines and eat so many foods that damage our systems."
11,raster,311,"If you are taking boulardii, I would not take it at the same time as antifungals. The antifungals will simply kill them because they are a yeast. I would consider boulardii when you are done with antifungals. Keep in mind that it should take 6-18 months to recover from candida overgrowth so going fast won’t get you to reach a cure faster. -raster"
12,shayfo,311,"You can try adding a few drops of eucalyptus essential oil to your bathwater to help open up your congestion. You can pick them up at Whole Foods or most health stores. Don’t use them full-strength on the skin or ingest them, though."
13,blt212,311,"So I finished the course of Diflucan – 100mg every other day and right up until the last pill I still got the asthma feeling the day after taking the pill. I then started my probiotic again, the Saccry Boulardi and I also got that Asthma feeling after taking it, the next day. Could this type of Probiotic be causing some dyeoff too and if so, should I alternate days. Lastly I thought I had this rash narrowed down to something to do with a connection to Citric Acid but I had a scratch test using Citric Acid and nothing showed up. Could it be that when I ingest it in some foods, it’s killing some yeast and then causing a rash…ugh, this is so darn confusing. The Allergist today, like so many doctors, just thinks this whole yeast thing is a crock. Called back the doctor who prescribed the Diflucan…he says, it worked if you feel better and there’s no test to see if the Candida Albicans number has decreased but that’s what the naturopath had run that showed it was high. I seriously am ready to give up….I’ve been living with this for 5 years and have gone to a dozen doctors and I’m seriously just tired of trying to figure it all out."
0,charlie1,312,"Hi everyone, I’ve been suffering with upper abdo pain since the beginning of last year and this has coincided with my die-off. Doctor’s first thought it was acid pain but now their telling me it’s not and it’s basically unexplained pain. I’ve had every test possible for this area and they keep telling me I’m fine. Has anyone else here had upper abdo pain which can be quite intense? (from candida symptoms that is) Not sure if it’s acid pain or not."
1,raster,312,Are you constipated? How many BM’s per day? -raster
2,charlie1,312,"Hi Raster, No not constipated, what do mean by BM’s? sorry. Just a bit more info for you – I did have testing for acid which showed up as quite a lot. I’ve just had surgery to correct a hiatus hernia for the acid pain but the pain remains. I’m convinced it’s something do with candida but just can’t work it out. The pain started after taking pau d’arco last year."
3,Kag,312,"Hey Charlie, if you got the pain after starting Pau D’Arco, maybe you should switch to something else. I had very bad reflux, which I hadn’t in a long time, when I started Oregano oil. I took myself off of the oregano oil after a week. It was awful. And Raster means Bowel Movements. 🙂"
4,raster,312,"If you are pooping less than 3 times per day, this is considered to be constipated per Dr. Mcoombs. If you are constipated then you can have all sorts of inner body problems. I had sharp pains a few times; I had to crap so bad while on the diet at times and all I had to do was go to the bathroom and it went away… -raster"
5,charlie1,312,"Hey Kag, Ah BM’s! I think they are probably less than 3 per day at the moment but that’s only recently. With the pau d’arco – I actually only took one capsule last year. It had such a powerful effect so I’ve just been using aloe vera which for me is still quite effective. I think there is some relation to acid, it’s almost like my acid production started kicking back into life as when I started getting the pain I didn’t have the fatigue and depressed feeling any more. I feel better from the candida symptoms but now switched to stomach pain. I can’t win damn it!! Thanks for the reply’s guys!"
6,Kag,312,"Hey Charlie, are you taking probiotics? Sometimes those can help balance your stomach acid."
7,charlie1,312," Hey Kag, Yea here and there, I’m now starting a proper course of them aswell as a product called intesigaurd which should help my overall health of my GI system. Thanks for your reply’s!"

I went to the website and looked at the Lab assay and it indicates that the product “inhibits” candida rather than killing it.

Keep us posted on your progress."

0,MsMollyJackson,315,Hello!  I’ve been suffering from candida for quite some time. I used to be pretty healthy physically and the last four months have been extremely non-physical (while cleansing).  Today I was trying to clean my bathrooms and hot extremely hot-like I was exerting a lot of energy? Is this common when fighting candida? It’s all really scary. My vision and eyes have been pretty off this week too…sending me into panic and anxiety. Anyone else have these things happening? I’m hoping this is just normal protocol…thank you!!
1,dannyle87,315,"Absolutely. Because your body ius already fighting the candida, it has less energy for other stuff like exercise. I actually work out every day and feel my limits sometimes but I have been a high perforance athlete all my life so dont worry your on the right track."
2,MsMollyJackson,315,Thank you!! I’m just trying to hang in there for the last of this…what a nightmare!
3,givingall,315,I found this blog on Candida and Inflammation in the athlete – http://curezone.com/blogs/fm.asp?i=1598887. It seems to state the same sort of effects that you’ve been experiencing.
4,flailingWcandi,315,I found this blog on Candida and Inflammation in the athlete – http://curezone.com/blogs/fm.asp?i=1598887. Interesting. Perhaps this  can help paint with a broader brush as well. This ties into what I’ve been digging up about how adrenal/thyroid/hormones (HPA axis) all tie in with candida cause and recovery. Blessings.
5,whyitsme,315,"I started an intense exercise regimen at the start of the year, working out 5 times a week. I also had to start a good cleanse/detox due to cheating so much over the holidays. The first 2 weeks, I started slow and only did a couple workouts a week, concentrating on the detox due to not feeling good. The next 2 weeks I increased workouts, but still had die off symptoms. I tend to go in cycles of die-off/cleanse about every week and a half. I really started pushing myself at a month, and though had some die-off ickiness, I started to do so much better. I have found that by really pushing myself, sweating a lot , plus sweating in steam rooms and saunas, I feel I am detoxing faster than I have in the past. The heart is pushing it out faster. Of course I get a lot of red bumps on my torso from the detox, but it’s all good knowing it’s getting out. I am now at 2 months, I am still having die-off, however not feeling crappy anymore. I am starting to feel the best i have in years. The last area to detox is my lower back, and it is starting to feel good with no pain! (It gets stiff and sore due to candida in muscle and joints). So I would highly recommend upping your exercise routine to help cleanse. Start slow, because yes you will feel bad in the beginning. But keep at it! The one thing about exercising a lot, is it makes me want to eat healthy, so therefore it becomes less of a diet and more of a way of life. So in the end it will help you cleanse!"
0,Tom1989,316,"Hi everyone, I am looking for some tips on how people cope with the overwhelming feeling of deprivation that can result from the food restriction of a typical candida diet. I have personally suffered with binge eating for some time and found it completely impossible to go on the diet. If I went on a restrictive diet, my bingeing episodes would just increase substantially. In fact, there is a consensus in the psychology field (especially where CBT is concerned) where highly restrictive eating can often proceed people developing binge eating disorder. Although I don’t entirely agree with this hypothesis, there is evidence that diets (like the candida one) can cause feelings of deprivation leading to a rebound effect (i.e. the binge). The good news is that I have been able to stop binge eating and reduce my refined sugar intake through the use of reinforcement and punishments (yes, I am a psychology student!). Also, have you found it’s better to transition to the candida diet gradually (e.g. reduce sugar intake over the first 4-6 weeks, before reducing/eliminating other problematic foods) or by just going cold turkey. I would prefer to hear people’s views based on experiences rather than what they believe. I would really like to hear what ways people have used to SUCCESSFULLY stick on the candida diet. Many Thanks, Tom"
1,alexalgebra,316,"I can totally relate to this. I have been on an increasingly restricted diet for the past two years due to food intolerances, leaky gut, and now candida. Previous to that, I would do the restrict/binge yo-yo…eat super low fat/calories for a week, freak out and eat a bunch of junk, feel terribly guilty and go back on low fat, repeat… Sometimes eating these restricted diets for my health takes me back there, where I feel restricted and want to binge, but if I remind myself that the restrict/binge cycle I used to do is part of what got me where I am now, and that this one is to make me actually healthy again, that helps me stay more positive. I’m not gonna lie, it’s also taking quite a bit of willpower to not overeat on the things I *can* have, like not blowing through a loaf of coconut bread in a day, etc. I have attended a few OA meetings, which have proven to be quite helpful, but I just can’t bring myself to commit to the program completely. This is totally my fault, and it would probably help me a lot, but at this point, I still feel too overwhelmed. I hope to find the courage to commit someday soon, though. – Alex"
2,hope4eva77,316,"i can sympathize !I do the same thing ,i start the diet and do it for 2 days and then binge on sugar !I told myself id start the diet when my supplements came or after new years and eat more than what i normally would in carbs and sugar !I feel guilty and the go back to the diet and reapeat the binge ! i bought l glutamate as many say it helps with cravings ,u can try this also ,i cant say if it works as i just started to take it today but many say it helps . i thought about trying to do it gradually and dont think its a problem ,i think anything that will help break our sugar addiction is worth trying and if t means eating a sweet potato or green apple instead of a candy bar to just get used to the change thats ok . how ever this will probably lengthen our recovery than if we went cold turkey and we may have a hard time giving up the apple also but i am doing it this way ."
3,shayfo,316,"I think of it in terms of things I do and do not eat, rather than things I “can’t have.” I think that subtle linguistic acknowledgement of choice is self-reinforcing for me. I’ve been vegetarian/vegan for over 12 years, and meat doesn’t even register as food to me at this point. A bit over two years ago I discovered I have an allergy to gluten, and again, gluten-containing foods are things I “don’t” eat, rather than things I “can’t” eat. A similar mentality has been helping me with the candida diet (I’ve been on it not quite a month at this point). I didn’t purge my house of food when I started, because I frequently buy non-perishables in bulk, and it would literally take me months to work through it all. Resultantly, there’s a butternut squash in my kitchen, gluten-free grains and flours galore in my pantry, maple syrup in my fridge, jars of nuts…this could be seen as maddening temptation, but I almost think it’s comforting to know that someday — though presumably not someday particularly soon — I’ll get to eat those things again, though obviously with care and measure. I try to take a long-term view of things, knowing that not eating something RIGHT NOW doesn’t mean it’ll stop existing and that I’ll never get to eat it again. A friend commented yesterday that as an INTJ in MBTI jargon, I possibly also have above-average self-discipline. I have no idea if there’s any truth to that. I hope you figure out something that works for you."
4,Tom1989,316,"Thanks for the prompt responses! It kind of good in a way (although sad to hear) to know that I’m not the only one struggling with this candida diet-binge cycle. I originally believed that changing the diet gradually is better as this diet-binge behaviour seems to be almost a habit. And as you all know, habits die hard. In the past, when I have tried to change too many habits at once, I would fail abysmally. But then when trying to focus on only changing one behaviour at a time I seem to have more success (by not taking on too much). So I’m applying this experience with the candida diet. It seems logical to change your eating over a long period of time gradually, so as to build knew habits successfully. Tom"
5,hope4eva77,316,"Yeah , everyone is different and sum people adapt to change better than others, I think even if it prolongs recovery if it helps break the addiction the benifits outweigh it. I am having a very hard time adjusting and it took me years to quit smoking but I did for my baby .eat a green apple or sum extra cocoanut bread. U are definitely not alone!"
6,Cmcanepa,316,"When I feel deprived I allow myself to indulge in the foods I can have. One of the difficult things about the diet for me has been alcohol. I’m very social and lots of social situation involve alcohol so what I do is take a couple bottles of home-made water kefir to events like dinner parties and drink it out of a wine glass. It’s silly but sometimes I feel a bit tipsy. Same with coffee, I miss it but I drink chicory coffee with stevia and coconut cream and it really has replaced my morning routine of needing coffee before I do anything. I’ll put lots of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and stevia in the coconut bread if I’m feeling deprived of desserts. Sometimes I eat way more than I need and I’ll feel a bit guilty but its all stuff that we are allowed… And plus I’ve lost a lot of weight on the diet. I never thought I could be so restrained with all the foods I loved before but I really have just found replacements. Today I was mostly at home and I ate sooo much but all within the diet. Hope this helps.  Carisa"

Now I have to do massages every day, and need a lot more energy than I had during the cleanse. Maybe I can get through 3 days of fasting w/molybdenum? Constipation was a problem though throughout the cleansing period, for which I did enemas, because nothing else worked until I started eating grains.Basically my question has anyone had sugar and then just keep on stage 2 eating? or should I cleanse again? ‘"
9,hope4eva77,316,i never did a cleanse but i also have a job that involves physical labor as nurse aid .i dont think u nedd to cleanse i have been struggling with this diet starting it and then binging and eating a bunch of forbidden foods at once than starting over again on phase 1 strict diet only to repeat the cycle i have yet to go thru a wk without cheating once so i am trying to make it thru ! i decided that adding in a green apple in my oatbran every few days and sweet potato with stevia and cinnamon is ok so i dont feel so deprived .
10,shayfo,316,"FreeRadical, I would just get back on the strict diet. I don’t think it’s necessary to repeat the cleanse, and as a massage therapist, I sympathize with your energy requirements. Fasting makes it very difficult to work, and since fasting won’t cure the candida infestation, I think it’s better to just keep plugging along."
11,Kag,316,"I have found if I focus on the pain that I experienced on my lips it really helps me to not cheat. My acupunturist and I had an interesting conversation about this awhile back. We talked about how much food has become “emotional”, because for most of us, food is abundant. She said we have stopped eating for nutrition and have started eating for taste. She also said, food isn’t supposed to be quick or easy. I think she has an important point. You just have to get away from emotional eating. Like, I hate brussel sprouts, but I am still eating them, almost every day now. I try to focus on the way the food makes me feel physically instead of how it makes me “feel”. That said, I still cheat from time to time. I don’t think there is anything with rewarding good behavior. 🙂 I try not to let one food turn into twenty though, it is very difficult indeed."
12,FreeRadical44,316,"Thanks all for the replies. I am keeping strong making beautiful healthy food, that I can easily digest, and will help me continue to heal. Having been a bodybuilder in my past, I know how to be disciplined to a ‘T’ when it comes to food, but certain diets that I had been on, actually did me more harm than good when I look back at how what I was eating kept me lean, but very taxing on my organs. We all have our reasons as to how our bodies became infested with candida in the first place, so what a treasure to get to know all of your stories, and to be pioneers in this way. One practice that is definitely helping me stay on track for most of this diet is meditation.  An extra way to learn to focus the mind to help one stay calm, balanced, and controlled. One thing that really threw me off the wagon, smoking mary j everyday. Once in a while, okay, but I learned for me that it slowly chipped away at my motivation to be “clean”, so cutting back on that 🙂"
13,ellerbee,316,"Hey, Based upon my own experience and medical advice that suggests that complete elimination of carbohydrates may not be the best route for healthy weight, brain function, and emotional health, I had to say no to the strict candida diet. Instead, I relied on reasonable, healthy eating (what is recommended on Dr. Oz’s website or what your integrative MD would suggest) while using a variety of prescription strength antifungals, a probiotic, and a couple natural supplements (many of them recommended on this site). If you can’t get the prescription strength antifungals, then my heart totally goes out to you. I tried strict-ish forms of the candida diet and they were pretty uniformly disastrous for me. Because my brain is my big money-maker, I couldn’t risk compromising it ;). Have you thought of going to an integrative MD? Best of luck to you on your journey!"
14,Kag,316,"I have, in the past, when I had a yeast infection, used prescription medication for yeast but I feel like with the diet you get at the root of the problem. I have always had a sweet tooth and I knew if I didn’t stop eating so many carbs and sugars, it wouldn’t matter how much medicine I took, I would always have the problem with the yeast. I see it as a way to get healthier too, honestly, this diet is better for all of us in the long run anyway, even people who don’t have candida."
0,kiwiguy,317,"Hi all, I’ve had Candida problems for a solid year now, got onto the diet around 3 months ago and have seen some marked improvement. Mine only really affects my stomach, I don’t get any exterior infections, rashes etc. I’ve come off all the bad foods, last one I was having trouble with was sunflower seeds. Now that I’ve come off that I was feeling good. Except the other day I started having a lot of onions and now I’m feeling nausea and have got some bloating, bit of brain fog. I’m not taking any anti-fungals at the moment, but a month ago I was taking coconut oil, caprilic acid, and grapefruit seed oil. I had to come off them because I was feeling sick. I was alternating the caprilic acid and grapefruit seed oil for 2 weeks for around two months while taking the 2 tbs of coconut oil/day full time. My questions are, 1. On average how long do you take the anti-fungals for? 2. Can you get rid of Candida with diet only? No anti-fungals (Maybe just allowing onion and garlic in normal meals) 3. Should I start up my dosage of anti-fungals again and up it a little? As you can see I’m confused, thanks for any help"
1,moochpb,317,"You can’t get rid of candida by diet alone. You need antifungals, start the dosages slow and maybe one at a time. I had terrible die off twice. I’m still upping them and feel fatigued and crap. And probiotics are your best frieds"
2,samuel50,317,Medication and diet are evenly important to get rid off candida.
3,raster,317,"To answer your questions: 1) You need to be on antifungals for you whole treatment if possible. You need to kill it off while you get better. 2) The diet shouldn’t reverse having a chronic candida infection alone unless you ate rutabega and brussel sprouts multiple times per day. It can be done, but this will still make you feel bad. You are experiencing die-off symptoms and here is some info about it: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm9759_DieOff-Symptoms-and-Cure.aspx#post9759 3) I would slowly introduce it if possible. I would start out at 1-3 drops per day and work your way up to maybe 20 drops per day of the antifungal. I personally added one extra drop per day until I could tolerate it, and then I added more as I progressed… -raster"
4,Able900,317," Actually, you can get by without supplements of antifungals if you eat at least a couple of whole food antifungals every day. They are: garlic gloves, onions, rutabaga, Brussels sprouts, jalapeno peppers, and coconut oil (you should have coconut oil every single day of the treatment). The three things you cannot get by without on a Candida treatment are: a good Candida diet, probiotics and kefir. You should slack off or stop an antifungal anytime the die-off symptoms become too severe for you to go about your daily activities. Able"

If you don’t like the taste of kefir, the only thing I know to do is to either learn to like it or learn to put up with the taste. I have no proof that it’s impossible to cure a Candida overgrowth without it, but from what I’ve experienced myself and what I’ve seen others go through on the forum, I would say it’s highly impossible. And even if you could do this, the overall time spent on the treatment would be multiplied many times meaning you would have to remain on the strict diet, antifungals, and probiotics constantly for a very long and extended length of time. Kefir is different from the probiotics, it contains strains of beneficial bacteria which you do not obtain from probiotic capsules. Able"

I feel so much better, but don’t think this is gone. I also got a script fluconazole in between doses of above holistic meds. My question is how do you know when candida is gone? My tongue is still white, so does that mean I still have candida? Seems as tho everyone is stating it takes months to rid yourself of this.

You still can have too candida but bloating is a sign for fermentation. There is a bacteria producing methanegas and this bacteriea is responsible for constipation. The diet here is thought to help the good bacteria to grow and to fill up the place of the intestines so the candida cant take over. Therefore people take a lot of probiotica and pre-biotica to feed their bacteria. But if you have a pathogen bacteria you too will feed it with all the fibre this diet includes. My 2-cent are this: If you with all this fibre eating dont have a good bowlmovement and are constipated and you are bloated, I believe you have a bacteria problem. Read about SIBO on the net. yours  Thomas"

I read another post about reflux and wonder if that is the discomfort I am feeling in my upper GI area in addition to the constipation. I have been eating a lot of nuts and seeds for protein and maybe they are the culprit. It’s just so frustrating to have symptoms that you didn’t have prior.

I also have sibo. Bloating and mild reflux. It’s pretty much gut dysibosis. It’s pretty much the same treatment but will probably take a little longer.

It is still hard for me, and I am getting a slow start, but hopefully, I can keep on plugging along and not get too far back because I want to start feeling better.

I have come to the conclusion that patheinine and biotin might be good for candida; I do need some extra’s b’s and iron. Also, should I be worried about the iron?

2,Able900,320,"Hello, K.I have read about lactoferrin, but has anybody had any success stores from it, derived from milk, be worried? The correct supplement is Apo-lactoferrin, and not regular lactoferrin. Lactoferrin and apo-lactoferrin are taken by people who are lactose sensitive or have an allergy to milk. This is because the lactoferrin is separated from the milk protein and fructose. However, a highly purified lactoferrin product should be purchased; these can be taken with confidence by those who are lactose-intolerant or have milk allergies. This probably means that you may need to pay more for a higher quality brand.

9,mrs.candida,321,"There are a few reasons why it’s not allowed. 1. it’s a bean, high in carbs and sugar 2. the caffeine in coco can affect your adrenal glands adversely  3. the low ph and high sugar in coco beans is perfect for yeast, one test showed that dried coco had 24 strands of yeast living on it. “Research by Hansen and Welty shows that yeasts multiply very rapidly during fermentation and are able to survive drying and storage. One can find up to 107 yeast/gram in stored beans. After fermentation the cocoa beans are dried.”I have been on the diet for about 3 weeks now and all the crap about eliminating sugar and the cravings will go away in a few days to a week is just that, crap.

Thanks for any and all advice. Personally in retrospect I think the first month should be a gradual process whereby you allow yourself one grade 2 cheat every other day, twice a week or whatever, like pork (Bacon&eggs for me!) or beef (Steak!). These will most likely irritate your gut but won’t set you back anywhere near as much as caffeine, heavy amounts of starch, sugar or yeast would. Essentially what Im trying to say is go easy on yourself at the start and allow yourself to progressively get more strict the easier it becomes for you. I found the intense sugar cravings or the need to wolf down a pizza very enticing and obviously at times found it difficult to overcome these thoughts, dont worry though, once you have eliminated sugar the sugar cravings will go after 5 days. I would say after about 3-4 weeks (when your ready..), finally start to eliminate sugar completely, after a week or so of eliminating it you should start to notice a difference. Good Luck Buddy! Grade 1 cheating for me is eating a chocolate bar, pizza etc Grade 2 is Pork, Beef, Nuts, Xylitol"

If you were following the alternate diet, you wouldn’t have to worry about going on zero carbs. For some reason I assumed you were following our protocol on the forum, Captain, I guess I was wrong. So where did you get the protocol you’re following? Able"
2,captainamerica,327,"I for some reason couldnt find an actual post for the alternative diet and then I remembered seeing a post to PM you for it if Im correct. So my current protocol basically is derived from what I was able to ascertain from reading other’s posts. I read such good reviews on Candex and Primal Defense online that I added those myself as I read Primal Defense was of a variety of probiotic that is stronger to take the place of Candida. Any quick input as to why you suggest stopping both would be great as I have a 70 dollar bottle of both currently. So as a summary, I had Candida for around 4 years before realizing it, although my symptoms honestly dont sound as bad as some that I have heard on here, perhaps I didnt eat a ton of sugar. I found out I had it in January and began implementing the Nystatin and removed sugar and bread from diet and thats about it. Now in the past two weeks I have gone to what I stated in original post here. Quinoa instead of rice, and just meat, yogurt, eggs, and almonds. If you could send me the alternative and strict diet and give any other quick suggestions it is greatly appreciated. When I first got on this forum I didnt know how to find everything myself and so I think Ive almost got all the info that I need to start really succeeding. Thank you for being the first source that I have had that actually knows something."

Any quick input as to why you suggest stopping both would be great as I have a 70 dollar bottle of both currently.Candex contains two enzymes which are not natural to humans and which we do not produce. They’re specifically cellulase and hemicellulase. In theory, it makes sense to assume that a supplement containing enzymes such as Candex (and Candidase as well) could treat a Candida infestation because the Candida have a wall which contains cellulose and hemicellulose (note the difference in the spelling of cellulose, cellulase, hemicellulose, and hemicellulase). Therefore in theory enzyme supplements can help kill the Candida by digesting their cell walls. On the other hand these enzymes are not specific to Candida walls; they can also be found in the vegetables we eat. So the enzymes will also break down the cellulose and hemicellulose that is in these foods that we eat on a daily basis. When the fibers in vegetables are broken down, the byproduct of the enzymatic breakdown is sugar in the form of glucose which feeds the Candida infestation. Therefore all the enzymes will do is kill some of the Candida while feeding the remainder leading to an increase of the population of the infestation. As far as removing all other supplements is concerned; I suggested this because I believe you need a fresh start meaning to start the stricter diet clean with no supplements for at least three days. The diet is so ‘clean’ that it acts as a very mild cleanse which will be good for expelling the negative toxins as well as the negative enzymes from your body. Primal Defense is a soil organism blend of bacteria which contains neither Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1 nor human origin probiotics. For these reasons I can’t see it playing a major part in a Candida protocol. However, when it comes time to add a probiotic (according to our protocol) if you wish to continue using the Primal Defense, I can’t imagine that it would do any harm. You may want to read the post on we have on Probiotics. Check your inbox on the forum for the strict diet. Able"
4,captainamerica,327,"Makes sense regarding the Candex. Yep, “ase” is the enzyme and “ose” is a sugar. Messing with an enzyme always seemed a little mysterious to me as their reactions are so volatile and you could hear the enzymatic reaction shortly after taking it. Maybe Ill see if I can return it and trade for something more useful. Thank you very much for your help Able."
5,raster,327,"An alternative to taking enzymes is to take bitters, which cause your body to produce its own enzymes naturally. I do personally take an enzyme product and do think it brings some benefit, but I am no specialist about health and am not going to promote it on this forum. My naturopath has been spot on for everything he has prescribed for me, so I will continue with the enzymes for a period of time… -raster"
6,ctz,327,"If the reason for Candex’s ineffectiveness is the conversion of vegetable cellulose into glucose, one could simply avoid fiber while using it. I’m sure people would be fine eating only vegetable oils, supplements, and other low-fiber/low-carbohydrate foods for a few days. It seems to me that this is a better alternative to things like oregano oil which damage healthy flora as well as the candida. Additionally, I would guess that we would not see candida “adapt” to these enzymes as they do for other antifungals since cellulose is a fundamental component of their cell walls; they can not do without it."

And did you have any symtoms when you started drinking it? Hoping it’s die off and not casein intolerance, because I really enjoy it. -Warm stiff neck -Brain fog/blurry vision -Anxiety -Low energy *JP*"
1,Marbro,330,"Most folks have a reaction to Kefir or any probiotic when they first start it. It should be taken in small ammounts at first. Its hard if you making a lot but only drinking 1 cup lol but if your having reactions then that is what you have to do. Your symtoms are in line with dieoff symptons many feel when they start probiotic treatment. If you are taking pill probiotics and anti fungals then these symptoms will be more pronounced. Start with a cup in the morning for a week then if your symptoms are still acting up then take a week off. I have read that it is benifitial to take breaks from drinking Kefir. It is somthing I will be doing myself and I drink a lot of kefir. take 1-2 days off each week. For more information about kefir I highly reccomend this site.

4,Able900,330,"Hello, Johnny. Brain fog, blurry vision, anxiety, and low energy are all die-off symptoms. If you have a Candida overgrowth, your lungs and kidneys are constantly eliminating toxins in the blood and lymph nodes; this sometimes can cause mid-back, neck, and shoulder problems stemming from inflammation. Understandably, the toxins are increased after drinking kefir, which fits right in with the liver and kidneys being overworked by eliminating the dying Candida toxins leading to neck-stiffness. Were you able to obtain Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate in Norway? By the way, feeling cold or chilled are just a few more of the many die-off-symptom possibilities. Able"
5,JohnnyPonny,330,"Jepp I bought molybdenum from “Iherb”. Two of my packedges got stopped in the mail and the 3 time I got it right. Ordered some other things to so it was a expensive lesson. And I think the molybdenum is helping with my die off symtoms. In my tretmeant nothing has given my so sever reaction as kefir.

6,Able900,330,JohnnyPonny wrote: Can a tbs of the stuff be that strong? When you eat it for the first few times it can; it’s a very powerful probiotic. You might try taking one molybdenum pill the last thing at night when you go to bed and one as soon as you get up in the morning to be sure it’s in your system before having the kefir. The symptoms will continue to lessen as more and more of the Candida die. Able
7,Javizy,330,"I think it’s worth comparing the symptoms you experience after taking strong probiotic capsules to those you get with kefir. I was getting some pretty bad symptoms from capsules, but the ones I got from Greek yoghurt were different and much worse – congested sinuses, losing control of appetite, cravings, mucous production etc. I tried testing it three times over an 8-week period and it’s really set me back. Water kefir is always an option, so give up the dairy if you think it’s causing you problems. You can always test it again when your die-off symptoms are reduced, then you’ll know for sure if you get a reaction."

0,420biker,331,"This thread is about how you brush your teeth.. i personally dont like to use toothpaste, i find it is very bad for your health. Fluoride is more poisonous than lead, and it is just less poisonous than arsenic. Fluoride changes the shape of the enzymes so that they no longer fit. Since enzymes are proteins, once they’ve been changed, they’re now foreign-looking. The body now treats them as invaders, even though they’re part of that body. This is known as an autoimmune situation – the body attacks itself and all systems in the body are damaged and we age much quicker. It also has the ability to burn flesh to the bone, destroy eyes, and sear lungs so that victims drown in their own body fluid. Need i say more? Anything that we put in our mouths goes directly through our bloodstream from underneith your tongue. Also, some toothpaste companies hide sugar in it as well. Ever since i quit using tooth paste about a year ago my health has improved by a longshot. Fluoride is a byproduct of metals like aluminum, and it is a byproduct of producing nuclear weapons… and they expect us to drink it in water and and brush our teeth with it? thanks but i think id rather be healthy. What i usually do is brush my teeth with hot water, scrape my tongue with the tongue scraper if needed, then brush that off too. Then gargle with sea salt or i heat up some water in the microwave beforehand, and add some coconut. This way was quite time consuming. But lately what i have found to work better than anything is to take a fresh strawberry, chew it up and let it dissolve in your mouth for about 20-30 secs.. then brush your teeth, and scrape if needed. If theres any fungus left use another strawberry. Then rinse and brush again with water. This way gets my mouth way more clean than any other method i have tried, and it takes no time at all… the acids will break down the fungus and it will come off your tongue much more easily. One other method is to buy these special toothbrushes that are meant for no toothpaste… they are expensive but im sure they work well. Its called an ionizing toothbrush. It activates ions when it is exposed to the light, and it destroys plaque very effectively so i hear.. so maybe it has an effect on fungus as well? I wouldnt mind trying it out. They cost around $50 the tooth brush, then you just replace the toothbrush heads… they are about $10 a piece."
1,Miriam,331,"Hi, What’s your opinion on Toms of Main toothpaste and mouthwash. I’ve been using the Myrrh & Propollus one? Thanks Miriam"
2,Javizy,331,Strawberries are acidic and contain sugar. I wouldn’t brush your teeth after dissolving one in your mouth if you want to keep your enamel. Why not just use fluoride-free toothpaste or at least baking soda or something?
3,420biker,331,"Yeah good point i guess strawberries are good for once in a while.. but you rinse with water and brush again so sugar isnt a problem, make sure you spit out the strawberry tho. Studies have proven that brushing with water is just as effective as with toothpaste, you just gotta keep rinsing your toothbrush. I think i heard somewhere that a dentist recommended using strawberries to whiten teeth and remove plaque. but your right its probably hard on the enamel. The Ionizing toothbrush is probably the way to go, once you buy the thing you only gotta spend $10 for a tooth brush head, and it neutrelizes the PH of your mouth so it probably would help against candida. It also keeps bacteria off the brush as well… they are pretty pricey but i think im gonna buy one soon."

6,420biker,331,"Well i broke the bank and bought the ionized toothbrush… and damn it was the best $50 i have ever spent… it paid for itself the first time i used it.

I put the toothbrush in the sun to charge it up and it worked much better than just the bathroom light… it works by light powering up ions that are attached to the teeth on the brush. This toothbrush amazes the hell outta me lol.. the future of brushing your teeth for sure. I dont recommend fluoride to anyone, no matter how bad your teeth are. Your health is much more important, tulip you should get one of these toothbrushes, you dont need toothpaste at all.

If you want good teeth you want good saliva and mineral metabolism. These things play much more of a role than how much sugar you eat. Fluoride is like a band-aid for these deficiencies, with side-effects that reach far beyond the mouth. One of the reasons milk is – or was when cows didn’t eat junk food – so good for teeth is because it contains vitamins A, D and K2, which are all vital for proper calcium metabolism. I’d wager the reason a recent study showed calcium supplementation was giving women heart attacks is because they were lacking these vitamins. Like I said, the quality of dairy has declined horribly, and low-fat dogma means people aren’t even absorbing what little goodness remains (ADK = fat soluble). D deficiency is recognised as epidemic and K2 is hard to get through diet. Without the necessary cofactors, calcium hardens the arteries and causes damage throughout the body; with them it massively improves health and gives you great teeth. Check out this post complete with x-rays showing reversal of cavities if you’re interested in some visual demonstration of the dental awesomeness of the ADK connection http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.co.uk/2009/04/images-of-tooth-decay-healing-due-to.html Click the ‘dental health’ category at the bottom of the post for more of the same. Milk also contains lactoferrin, which acts to break down plaque. Healthy saliva naturally contains this as well as secretory IgA, which helps to kill bacteria. So if you resolve reasons behind dry mouth and poor calcium metabolism, you can indulge in the occasional bit of honey and fruit without worrying your dentist 😉"

0,Able900,332,"Anti-inflammatory Agents The strongest herbal anti-inflammatory herbs are steroidal herbs. The best choices are yucca root and licorice root. Using a combination of both herbs would work best. The sterols are the agent responsible for reducing inflammation, lowering cholesterol levels, and building adrenal hormones which in turn strengthen the adrenal glands which are of course a major part of the immune system. Intestinal Permeability Syndrome (Leaky Gut Syndrome) Yucca root is especially helpful in reducing intestinal inflammation which would benefit those with leaky gut as well as alleviating many of the symptoms and disorders associated with leaky gut syndrome. Yucca root used as a food is hypoallergenic which means it shouldn’t aggravate the system by adding to the allergies associated with leaky gut. A Prebiotic Yucca root is perfect for supporting the healthy digestive flora. Yucca root actually provides more benefits than pure FOS or inulin by holding moisture in the colon which naturally provides a more beneficial growth environment for the beneficial bacteria; plus, it’s also fiber-rich which supplies healthy food to the flora. Yucca Root and Die-Off Yucca root supplies saponins; these saponins are able to literally bind with the ammonia produced by Candida, then the toxins are excreted from the body, therefore ridding the body of a possible debilitating toxin. Adrenal Glands Yucca root is very helpful in rebuilding the adrenals and therefore the immune system. If used to build the adrenals, you should also supply other needed nutrients such as pantothenic acid and lots of vitamin C. Preparing Yucca root can be taken in herbal form in capsules found in health and vitamin stores. Yucca root can also be found in many supermarkets and prepared by boiling and/or baking. When boiled, yucca root can be mashed and eaten like mashed potatoes. Keep in mind that excessive boiling reduces the sterols which are beneficial. Able"
1,Javizy,332,"This is the one that acts like pregnenolone, isn’t it? All the steroid hormones are derived from pregnenolone. You can see the pathways in this diagram. The natural hormone is also available as a supplement. It’s non-toxic but it tends to be sold in unnecessarily high doses (50-100mg tablets). If the supplements provide relief, it may suggest issues with cholesterol, thyroid (T3) or vitamin A, since all are necessary to produce pregnenolone. A myriad of other factors can interfere along the pathways, as well as with obtaining the pregnenolone co-factors too. This is one reason I think adrenal fatigue is such a bogus diagnosis."

Pregnenolone is the “mother” hormone that all of the steroids are derived from (see the link in my previous post). It seems to help a lot of people, but it can be somewhat unpredictable, depending what’s going on in your body that influences the pathways. It’s likely to help if you’re not producing enough though, and in this case it’s worth checking thyroid, cholesterol and vitamin A levels."

1,Kag,339,Bumping this. I am really tired of my lips hurting all the time… Anything I can do for this that is natural? Anybody? Thanks.
2,Able900,339,"Hi, Katie.  The berberine in the goldenseal is still going to go into the bloodstream since anything rubbed on the body is absorbed into the skin and eventually the bloodstream. Plus, you’re going to lick your lips occasionally. If you want to try it, just be alert for any worsening of the Candida symptoms, and I wouldn’t want to use it for a prolonged period of time. Of course, the problem isn’t really located on the lips – if this were true, one would be able to rub a strong antifungal on the lips and they would stop hurting after a while because the Candida would be dead, but this isn’t the case. I had the same problem and the pain didn’t go away until the infestation started diminishing to a considerable degree. I probably tried a dozen different products, all to no avail until I realized the problem was inside me, not on my lips. Regular Vaseline seemed to help more than anything else. If you see no improvements after 24 hours, I would stop using the goldenseal ointment. Able"
3,Kag,339,"Thanks Able, I had already pretty much decided against the Golden seal because of the licking thing… I was just trying to find something natural that would be soothing. My acupuncturist doesn’t like me using vaseline all the time, I am trying to use an herbal lip balm she gave me, it is nice, with sesame oil. I just would have liked something that would help with the tightness and pain… I am just really down today. Thank you for answering. Katie"

I have recently been experiencing some pretty strange things and as far as I can tell, it seems to be candida. I’ve gone to several doctors this past week looking for assistance and relief with little success. I was initially told it was just food allergies and told to take benadryl…no help, then took prednisone, no success. Finally asked for diflucan and I’m now seeing strange things. I started the Candida Diet which has helped with the throat swelling, nostril swelling & headaches, but hasn’t eliminated them. I weighed 110 lbs 2 months ago and now weigh 94 lbs. I am fearful of the weightloss that continues. I’ve only been on the candida diet for 4 days. I have now been referred to an Infectious Diseases doctor. Please advise what I can do for relief. I’m afraid to eat because of symptoms flaring up, can’t consume the right number of calories per day due to limited foods on the diet. I feel as though I’m in a downward spiral with no way up.

I’ve gained over 30 pounds on the diet because I am now getting the proper nutrition and the bugs aren’t sapping my energy. -raster"
4,Lady with babies,340,"Well, I would have to say what has made me consider that what I am experiencing may be Candida is mainly because of the fact that last week I noticed that randomly my throat and tongue had swollen. I went to the ENT and he stated that it was simply a delayed food allergy reaction and suggested that I may have Hashimoto Thyroid Disease. He indicated that the benadryl should help if I needed to take it – do so. This again happened (throat and tongue swelling up) I took benadryl and there was no change. I delt with it. A few days later, I felt it again and felt as though I couldnt breathe – (most likely panic was the worst part) and went to the ER. the ER physician contacted the ENT and they agreed – food allergies. I was given steroids. The steroids actually made it worse. A few weeks before this took place I had a random reaction to Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. I hadn’t had that before either. So, of course I googled everything… self diagnosing, panic… I have been losing weight steadily for the last 2 months. Thanksgiving – i weighed 110. Now as of yesterday – 94. I cannot remember the last time i said “I’m hungry” I only say – I need to eat because I know that I have to get food into my body in order to continue to function. Random things are causing me to have an allergic type reaction and yet the “allergy” doesn’t respond to standard treatment. I haven’t been able to sleep – which is driving my husband batty. I’ve noticed for a couple of months that anytime I eat something like a cookie that contains a good amount of sugar – I almost instantly get a headache and intense pressure in my head as though it is going to pop off. There have been subtle things that have been indicators in the past, but I just dismissed them. Now, with the reactions of “food allergy” and weight loss – I cannot continue to dismiss whatever is happening and need to resolve it. I just cant imagine what happened. My diet prior to this past week was primarily chicken breasts and organic food. I bought almost nothing other than USDA certified organic products and I have always consumed enough water. Another thing is – when i get upset or stressed – throat swells – i feel like a blow fish. It has now been confirmed that I do not have Hashimoto Thyroid Disease, and I have seen my primary physician – he didn’t know what to tell me. I insisted that he draw blood to determine the Candida but wont have results back for 3 days or so. In the meantime, I have an appointment with a TCM (Chinese Medicine) and an immunologist and my primary physician asked me to see the Infectious Disease doctor. I did advise the PCP of the other appointments and he said I should keep them. Another thing that surprised me – was the fact that when I asked to have my blood drawn to test Candida – my PCP looked confused. The ladies in the lab – where the draw the blood, said they had never heard of that blood test and were surprised to have found it. All I know is, I am not eating enough, I have been losing weight. I have random reactions for no known reason and I have had the post nasal drip – which i immediately coughed up. I begged by OBGYN to prescribe Diflucan and since I have been taking that – there have been changes – all over the place. Mainly feeling terrible. I’m sorry to carry on as I have but I am just looking for assistance from others that are more knowledgeable regarding this subject. As I said before, any thoughts, opinions, tips, directions – would be greatly appreciated."

0,anidstylie,342,"I have had this since birth. I had my tonsils out when I was a child because they would not let go of bacteria. They did not think about my stomach flora being off balance. My mother passed down the overbalance in gram negative bacteria candida. My grandma, probally to her. She was an alcholic who drank alot which promotes yeast growth in the stomach. Our parents transmit what they have or do not(as in good bacteria in stomach). The stomach is key to good immune system and must be balanced. As an adult I even GREW yeast on my skin. What is in the stomach comes out on the skin. My candida manifested itself in the form of tinea vesicolor. Patches on my skin that were fungal(yeast). I started to become aware of the way I felt when I ate sugar. I linked the candida to everything I suffered as a child even my supposive ADHD! See when I ate sugar the yeast would release gases and make me spazzzy. I could not concentrate had all the syptoms of ADHD. Well my yeast on my skin was the key. I would eat something and watch my skin. When I would eat suagr any form it woulf get red and raise and grow, as well as I would be up all day and night. I then started to develope allergys to wheat, from the overload of yeast in my system, it made me sensative to alot of stuff.Id get hard bumps on my scalp when Id eat sugar. My ear wax smelled like yeast. Id get yeast infections like crazy.The worst though was how it was spreading all over my BODY! It itched and you could see it,I felt like a growing plague. I tried EVERYTHING those stupid clenses, the diet,coconut oil,garlic,cinnamon nothing worked…and then I got some kefir grains. See kefir grains are probiotics they EAT the candida. They conteract the imbalance in flora in our stomachs. The imbalance fueled by sugar and yeast. EVERYTHING HAS SUGAR and YEAST in it. Okay so like when we eat bread its alive it has yeast, it dont die it mulptiplys like BEBE’s kids. Same thing with the kefir BUT its the good guys so to speak. Its not like yogurt its millions of live strands of probiotics and literally they EAT the candida!!!! I started to notice relief right away. I obtained grains from the kefirlady. You can get some from me to if you like. I also did the diet when I first started absolutly NO SUGAR not even fruit. Not untill I was rebalanced and even then I rairly eat it and its usually fruit form. I also took 5 tablespoons of coconut oil a day. Please dont do what I did and just start out on 5. The die off period was intese and I vomited the first day. Work your way up to that. I also did a garlic clove in the morning and one at night. This will assist in fighting off gram negative bacterias and yeast but leave the postive guys intact(mom nature taking care of us) then I would have kefir milk in the morning and kefir milk in the night. NOT THE CRAP FROM THE STORE. It is sugar and the live starins cannot survive the processing. Im talking the real deal like the grains from tibet. You have to love them and take care of them for they are a LIVING being! I can help you with that as well. I also make everythign with the kefir. Sourkraut,kefir sourdough bread(ITS PROBIOTIC BREAD HEHE)cheese(its probiotic cheese not processed invasive YEAST cheese from store). I make kefir pesto white sauce flaxseed pizza,today i made a kefir alfredo sauce.I have almost NO YEAST on my skin now and I am serine and my head feels so differant, I used to be a spazz. I NEVER get sick now NEVER. I also obtained a kumbucha scoby from the kefir lady and have more probiotics that way.I have several ppl who I have also treated with this method. You can email me directly for I will not be on this forum often. I just had to let people know rebalance the inside get the good put back into you and it never goes away persay cause you need those guys to but the overbalnce is rebalanced!!!

0,FRIZZLED456,343,"By reading this site it seems that Candida is common. I went to the dr and had many tests done, the doctors told me I was normal. When in fact I had an overgrowth of yeast. Sooo Why don’t Physicians test for this illness? It is serious."
1,raster,343,"There are a few major reasons doctors don’t test for candida: -They are under educated about todays health problems. -They only promote pharmaceutical medication as a means to address the problem; there isn’t many pharmaceutical drugs that fight candida and provide relief. -Doctors don’t heal, they only address the symptoms. -Doctors want you to be ill so that you can develop more severe health problems that require very expensive drugs or treatments (such as cancer). How do you heal multiple organs that are damaged with pharmaceutical drugs such as the liver, intestines, stomach, thyroid, adrenals, and more? There is no single drug that heals ANY of these organs -Candida is actually the cause of many of todays health problems such as hyper/hypoglycemia, krohns disease, cancer, seizures, blood pressure, arthritis, and more. Imagine what the world would be like if they could cure all of these ailments at once; through a protocol that reverses candida growth…the medical system would completely collapse! Here’s a good interview I listened to today called the history of medical tyranny: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Xy4Fl1XF9I The medical industry was actually created by the rockefeller and carnegie families in the early 1900’s; they did good things throughout history, right? -raster"
2,Lana15,343,"I am sorry to hear that you have candida. I believe the reason that candida is commonly not diagnosed by doctors is a lack of research and information about candida.

3,Bucephalus,343,"Floggi wrote:   Extremely unlikely, especially for the younger (very well educated) doctors. It’s even unfair to say this as a generic statement toward all older doctors. 1) Floggi, you generalise about doctors yourself so you have to be careful with your outspoken negativity whenever you post if you’re going to criticise peoples’ reasoning, you can be guilty of using the same type of reasoning. I remember you generalising about American doctors and doctors from Netherlands, that you were saying they were better than American ones was the general gist of your statement, well sorry, that’s a generalism too. So either you’re going to accept other people generalising in their arguments, or you’re going to stop generalising yourself. What’s it going to be? 2) What do you mean by “educated” with regard to younger doctors? If you’re talking about formal education, I would be very surprised that universities teach anything about this illness that most of the people of this website suffer. If you’re not talking about formal education, what type of education are you talking about? Not experiential education surely, because it would be hard to argue that younger doctors are experientially more educated than older doctors. So obviously, you’re talking about some other education rather than these two… what education are you talking about? 3) Maybe you should try and adopt a more supportive role in the forum, particularly towards newer people who are in distress and in need of help. The last thing they need is some cranky old woman rebutting every query they have. 4) Raster, most of what you said I don’t agree with. David."

This averages to roughly one research paper created per day since that time. Dr. Mcoomb’s has a lot of them in his media library and you have to be a medical professional to access the rest. -raster"
5,raster,343,"Hello Floggi, All I gotta say to you is that you have been nothing but a troll on this forum and have not done anything that is constructive or helpful to anyone’s discussion or health problems. I did find your thought’s on chris’s enemas amusing though, but I don’t think its a best use of energy to go around trolling on these forums without having anything positive to say. Relating to this, I would like to hear your reasons to why candida is not diagnosed by the medical industry? I’d say that roughly 99% of the medical doctors here in the US have no training, experience, or knowledge relating to candida and there is very few specialists that you can visit at a doctors office to get treatment. One of my hobbies in my spare time and while working is listening and researching conspiracy stuff; so I am not going to waste any energy on this unless you are educated on the subject and are even close to the same level I am at. Have you listened to Dr. Mcoomb’s radio shows? In his radio shows he states that candida causes many illnesses that humans experience including arthritis, diabetes, dementia, hypo/hyperglycemia, and more. He has cured thousands of people with these problems, sometimes very quickly! I think atleast some of my statements have relevance or are half-truths at the minimum. It takes research to back up what I am saying and I don’t have time to bust out research papers on the subject and I doubt you will listen or read the stuff I post. -raster"

Remember, candida is present in all sorts of disorders ranging from diabetes to AIDS. I don’t mean to frighten anyone but I feel that it is unwise to self-diagnose."

If you go in and say something is wrong here, they will give you an antibiotic and/or vaccine without even testing you for the problem (most of the time). Antibiotics and vaccines are destroying many peoples lives and there has been no or little independent medical testing in regards to their side effects. Many digestive disorders are due to low HCL levels but doctors do not prescribe HCL to treat the problems. Instead they prescribe medication or an antibiotic which has negative side effects, especially for those who have digestive disorders.

Anyone who tells you to stop educating yourself is compromised. The third Doctor I saw completely agreed with me, assessed me and confirmed it. And then prescribed anti fungals that didn’t do a darned thing. When it didn’t work, she said “Well, lets just try it again….” I gave up on the Doctors. And have relied on myself, and the research of the few Doctors around the world who actually care. Surprisingly, Japan, and South American Doctors lead the way. And provide a lot of insight and help. What is a common denominator, is anything that is tied to the success of big Pharma, will not promote or perpetuate truthful information about alternatives to their medicines. Not a conspiracy theory, just my well researched opinion. Also, if you are going to accuse people of being conspiracy theorist, at least know what a conspiracy is, and how it is defined. As a healthcare employee, and someone who has a Doctor for a father, it is scary what they claim to know. I grew up going to the pharmaceutical retreats and conventions at ski resorts that piled in Doctors from around the country. It is sick. These companies would co-opt doctors with false information, basically putting lipstick on a pig. And 99% of these Doctors would eat it up, along with all the booze and free gifts. I grew up watching it. My own step father grew a conscience one day and became ill with guilt over this stuff. It is real. Deal with it."

Usually I am the first one to pick up an illness, but I think the pinecone extract is helping. What kind of symptoms are you having?"
3,fixme,344,"I have thrush, possible, yeast infection, frequent urination(!), constipation (moreso now), always getting sick.

The whiteness on my tongue has actually improved drastically since I have been on the pinecone extract, or it’s just a coincidence but either way it’s clearing up. It sounds like you have a yeast infection, you are doing the right thing by giving your immune system the extra push. It seems most success stories come from taking care of your immune system and letting it go to work. Is your tongue white?"

I had a very annoying sauna experience the other day (but I won’t compain :P) I think my yeast infection may be gone. Also I was embarassed to admit but I’ve had nail fungus since last year (slight, you’d have to look closely.) That looks like it’s clearing more with no extra efforts. I think I’ll know I’m “healed” when my thrush has evaporated and I only have to pee LESS than 10-20 times a day. What a dream! 🙂"

In addition I’m taking additional  *food enzymes *probiotics *liver balance (bupleurum root, peony root without bark, typhonium rhizome, cinnamon twig, dang gui root, fushen sclerotium with root, scute root, zhishi fruit, atractylodes rhizome, ginseng root, ginger rhizome and licorice root) *spleen activator (Ginseng root, astragalus root, atractylodes rhizome, hoelen sclerotium, dioscorea rhizome, lotus seed, chaenomeles fruit, citrus peel, galangal rhizome, ginger rhizome, hyacinth bean, licorice root, magnolia bark, tang-kuei root, typhonium rhizome, cardamon fruit and zanthoxylum hull of seed.) *Lung Support (as my lungs have been feeling very heavy for the last couple of weeks – having had pneumonia several times in my life and having black spots that show up on xrays though no active disease)Its primary herbs—anemarrhena, aster, bupleurum and astragalus—have been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to boost the immune system, build energy and support the respiratory system. *adrenal support *thyroid support *magnesium 650mg  *Mineral Balance  *8000iu (I’m very low) I have been told for 14 years that I have auto immune disorders likely MS or Lupus. Within 3 days of having my child I developed chronic pain in every single joint in my body, fatigue, memory issues, muscle weakness, my eye sight went from a perfect 20/15 a year ago to 20/200 this year, even my opthamalogist remarked on it. I don’t have all the markers for full diagnosis on any of the auto-immune disorders so they’ve kept me in a gray unknown area. I have been gluten free for 11yrs, but have very high inflammation so my leaky gut obviously has never healed. I did an elimination diet 3yrs ago for 6 weeks and found out I was also reactive to eggs. Recently I developed an anaphlactic reaction to paprika and romain lettuce started giving me sever headaches and naseua. I had allergy panels ran and had absolutely no allergies show up. Yes, frustrating. Having recently read about candida symptoms and having checked off a majority of them, there was no question that this applied to me so I ordered the 14 day cleanse. I started taking the supplements as recommended (3x daily) and within just a few days the pain that I’d had for 14yrs was (and still is) gone! However, I started waking up at 4am with a racing heart, (150+bpm) severe nightmares, and was having a very bizarre feeling in my muscles as if threads of fiber were being pulled from the outside in…my thought is this was the body pulling the candida out of the muscles and into the blood stream to be processed out. Due to the nightmares I added in the liver balance and spleen activator and cut the supplements down to 1x a day. Without realizing how intense I needed to be on the diet I was eatting an apple a day and doing a protein shake for breakfast which has sugar cane 3g in it until this week. Doing more research I realized that I needed to make these additional tweaks to my diet, so my diet is very strict now and I’ve continued taking the supplements 1x a day (total 1 month now). I have had constipation since removing the apple so I did add in the extra magnesium to help. I had someone mention to me yesterday that I likely have parasites since I was waking up in the middle of the night with the nightmares. This would make sense as I had giardia as a child when our city water got contaminated and I doubt that they treated it correctly all those years ago. I finished the candida cleanse supplements today and don’t know if I should start another round of them right away now that I have the diet down and do it correctly for another 14 days or if thats too much? Or if I should stick with the diet and just the probiotics,enzymens, minerals, liver/spleen/lung supplements? Not having first hand insight on this I don’t want to make the infestation worse as I’ve obviously had it for years with some pretty harsh symptoms but I also don’t want to take it too far in the other direction either. I do have some muscle cramping going on today, which leads me to think that I might need to take a break from all the anti-fungals? Or it might be dehydration (but I’ve drank 94oz of filtered water today (7.0). Sorry for the long note, but thought it would be best to give more details upfront and hopefully someone would be familiar with what I’m experiencing. Thanks!"
1,raster,346,"Hello Winaker, Check out this symptom list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6305_100-candida-symptoms-list.aspx I highly recommend consulting a naturopathic doctor who can help you heal each and every organ properly and effectively. You might have more complex issues than what we can provide in a “treatment plan.” If you have leaky gut, this is good indication you have candida. The thing is about candida and parasites is that we all have them, but at different levels. So you definitely have them in your body…its whether or not they have overgrown and caused you health problems. I also had a bad reaction to paprika when I had leaky gut, so its a common one from my experience. It sounds like you are experiencing die-off at one degree or another since doing your candida cleanse, and protecting your kidneys and liver is very important. You will need the proper supplements to do this, otherwise you will feel like crap. We have a strict forum food list that most forum members follow, its a pretty good one to start out with if you are looking for guidance. Please list your diet if possible. We also developed this general plan to get better: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx -raster"
2,winaker,346,"Thanks Raster, I’ll go over the protocol tomorrow in detail, every little bit of insight helps! I’ve actually seen 2 ND’s over the past 4 years (along almost 30 specialists) none of them have suggested candida. Believe it or not, 1 of the ND’s even specializes in gluten intolerance and leaky gut, but never mentioned candida even knowing all my symptoms. smh. The allergist that I saw in Dec laughed when all my allergy tests came back negative and said that I just have “one of those bodies” and there was nothing more that she could suggest. I started keeping a food diary so it was easy to find any new signs. When I first looked into the cleanse I thought that it was going to be a little more straight forward based on the directions on the box, so I started without doing ALL my research first. Not like me to do that, definitely a lesson learned! Once I started I didn’t want to stop taking the supplements and make things a bigger mess for myself so I stuck with them and made adjustments after I came across this site. I’m going to call around on Monday and see if I can find an ND that works with this regularly. Fortunately once I cut the apple and protein shake out my diet its now vegetables (kale, broccoli, onions, garlic, bell peppers, brussel sprouts) with romain lettuce and either Organic chicken, ground turkey, steak, or salmon (wild sockeye) we only use coconut oil for cooking and I do spritz olive oil on veggies after they’ve been broiled. I’ve only had quinoa once as I’m trying to even stay away from all grains just for awhile. I juice veggies or have pecans, walnuts or pumpkin seeds for snacks. So it’s really pretty basic right now. Albeit I did see some good breakfast recipes on here that will be a welcome addition. Thanks again for the info! It’s good to have insight from others so you don’t feel like your lost in the dark."
3,alexalgebra,346,"When I started having die-off and started the strict diet and protocol, I had nightmares for about a week. I rarely have them normally, so this was definitely unusual, but they went away after the first week, maybe two."
4,winaker,346,"Thanks alexalgebra I wasn’t certain if it was die off, parasites, or over stimulation of the brain from everything I am doing so suddenly. They were horrible and so vivid…never experienced anything like it before. Good to know others have had this experience."
5,brownhair,346,Dear Winaker – I am new to the detox and was wondering where you ordered the 14 day cleanse and what you took?
6,winaker,346,"I’m doing this candida cleanse http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/product/candida-clear-14-day/sku-958.aspx I’ve also been taking the probotic eleven and the food enzymes that they offer. They also have a para cleanse and a clean start. Had I done a little more research before I jumped into it, I probably would have done the clean start first and then did the candida clear. That being said, I personally feel better now than I have in years and I’m glad that even though I’ve stumbled through it that I’ve stuck with it."
0,Kag,347," So I am going to try the lemon water and I bought some garlic pills because too much garlic smell really bothers me. Can someone tell me what you recommend in terms of amount of garlic. Each one of these pills is 500 mg, but I don’t know how many to take to equal the amount you get from fresh. Thanks again for all your wonderful help! Katie"

2,Able900,347,"Hello, Katie. You can start with one 500 mg pill a day, and depending on the degree of die-off it may cause, you can add another pill every day until you reach three or four pills a day. The number of pills is up to you. A total allicin potential of 4,000 mcg equals one garlic clove. You’ll probably do better by taking the pills with a meal as it should help to lessen the aftertaste. People who are taking blood-thinning or antiplatetlet medications or aspirin should avoid garlic. Able"

0,Kag,348,"I would like to know if anyone on here has ever had a candida antigen test performed by a regular doctor? I have emergency medical coverage through a university hospital, cannot afford a naturopath. I would ask a regular doctor if you think they wouldn’t laugh in my face. I also suffer from depression so doctors tend to put everything on that instead of me being proactive about my health. I asked my dermatologist about yeast, and she said that it was more likely a product allergy. She said she didn’t know much about yeast and didn’t do anything with diet… geez… I mean there are skin disorders caused by yeast so why do they know so little?"
1,flailingWcandi,348,"I had to print out this page and take it into my Dr. while requesting running the candida antigen blood test. It wasn’t too expensive and I don’t have health insurance but, a whole lot of more expensive tests were ran at the same time so, I really don’t know what the cost is – BUT< THEY ARE WORTH EVERY PENNY!  “Blood Test An Anti-Candida Antibodies, or Candida Immune Complexes test. There are 3 antibodies that should be tested to measure your immune system’s response to Candida – IgG, IgA, and IgM. High levels of these antibodies indicate that an overgrowth of Candida is present. This is the most reliable test for Candidiasis that you can find.”  In my case, one of the three antigen tests came back at 30.0 ~!!!! Whereas a normal value in a healthy person should be between 0.0 and 0.9 !!! 30 vs <.9 yep, firm and undeniable. Without printing out and showing what actual candida antigen tests to run resulted in him immediately reaching for his lab order form. Whereas, over the past year of telling him there was such a test resulted in him continuing in wanting to refer me to a nutritionalist. Once he saw the incredibly high candida antigen of 30 vs <.9 he mumbled, “I’ll do some research….” (*headshake*) like he did NO research over the past year while I’ve been suffering and pleading for him to look into if there were firm diagnostics out there, or once learning the lab down stairs from his office even runs the candida antigen blood test. The approach of printing out and handing him the information so he could just order the test resulted in immediate positive action: I highly recommend everyone do the same and save themselves the time, effort and frustration of going through what I went through until the magic fairy dust of a web site print out waved it’s magic wand over him and presto, his pen started writing up the lab order form!!!! amazging how that works!!! I’m not sure if this will allow us to use it as a marker of progress, such as if we run the same tests will they show a lowering of antigen levels as my body get’s well, or will it continue to increase if I get worse? Humm,,……I hope it’s the prior as it would be great to have some firm diagnostic to show progress from as I put everything I’ve got into treatment. Blessings"
0,klips32,349,"Since toxins from yeast suppress the thyroid function, I’ve experimented with taking extra iodine. I must tell you guys that I am not a doctor ore had enough education on the thyroids to completely advice about this, I only writes this because it helps me. I may ore may not help you. A normal multivitamin contains aprox 150mcg iodine. The normal body needs 50-75mcg. Iodine stimulates the thyroids to produces T4 and T3 and other hormones. Taking more then the recommended dosage can harm the thyroids, but dosages must be quite higher then I recommend to take. The Japanese have a average daily iodine intake that is 13.8 mg (about 100 times the U.S. RDA).They have remarkably lower rates of breast,endometrial and ovarian cancer, and significantly lower rates of fibrocystic breast disease and prostate cancer. They also have low rates of obesity, and are noted for their academic achievements. Also, to partly destroy the thyroid functions, a daily amount of 200mg (NOT mcg) is used (to treat hypERthyroidism). I use, in worsen periods of time (candida) 1 multivitamin pill in the morning and 1 150mcg (note: Not 150mg) around mid-day (depot pill). This really helps on the fatigue that comes along with Candida. Note that a pill take aprox 3 hours to work, don’t take it to late in the day, else you might not sleep. Hope this is useful knowledge for some of you 🙂"
1,Sydney Keith,349,"Thanks for sharing this information. Did you see results after the first 3 hours? Or was it a few days of repeating use of the pill until you noticed a difference. I have tried it in the past, but didn’t get the results you had. What brand did you use?"

After that I took antifungal medicine, but never stayed on a diet afterwards and kept getting a white tongue and other symptoms like fatigue, sore throat, etc. Right now I am taking apple cider vinegar as an antifungal, and a probiotic. However, the whitness on my tongue comes and goes, and I have not introduced anything new. It is not really white just a light coat. However, my fatigue has lessened and other symptons. How can I tell when the yeast is gone? Is a little white ok? Also sometimes it is mainly gone. I am a bit confused."

What can I do? Is it really worth losing all this weight to continue on the diet? If we don’t see results anytime soon it will seem like it’s doing more harm than good. Is there anything he could add back into his diet to remain healthy? His tongue will get better and worse by the day. Is this normal, die off, or is this an indication that something in his diet is feeding the candida at times? We live in Thailand so many of these remedies are not available. If we get it shipped to us it costs a lot so we need to be sure these things will work. What are the most important things to be taking? Thanks, Katie"
4,flailingWcandi,350,"From my understanding you can tell how you are doing with getting control of Candida through the Candida Antigen Blood test – I find oil pulling to work well with helping control oral thrush (white tongue) by brushing my tongue slightly when I brush my teeth. EV Coconut oil is probably preferable in all the other benefits in taking toxins and bad bacteria from one’s mouth…..I also tend to think of these as signs of body reactions to some “cheat items” or what ever; cause if I cheat the tongue appears white again the next day. I assume this is what everyone talks about watching for flare ups or reactions to certain foods, etc… You might want to check out Able’s posting to another member about why it’s best to avoid acv for a period of time during treatment or certain other antifungals like Oil of Oregano, etc. I know, I didn’t rotate Oil of Oregano but, kept using it for months and the eugenoil it contains started causing skin issues. Stopped the Oregano and the skin issues seems to have calmed down almost instantly. I thank DVJorge for pointing out how some typical antifungals we get into a rhythm into our treatment plans, if not careful, can cause other issues which can cause problems on their own. Remember, the diet contains a lot of veggies with antifungal properties which many forget and load up on antifungals. Then start wondering if the fact they are suddenly feeling worse is die-off or what have you. Aggressively attacking candida has done me more worse for the wear, as I jumped out of the gate with little knowledge and a desire to attack it aggressively. It’s taken at least 6 months to calm things down but, little by little I’m learning to be in better tune to reactions and have a better chance in figuring out what is causing further discomfort: particularly since die-off alone makes one concerned they are getting worse. Anyway, that’s my two cents – a more gradual less aggressive treatment could pay dividends of a short treatment period, than making mistakes and losing time in the process but, I would doubt if most here haven’t made their fair share of mistakes along their journey – that’s why when I hear people talking on planning on a 12 to 18 month treatment period as a time frame is lost on me. Blessings and many blessings of healing graces to you,"

3,Flipper,351,From time to time when my water kefir grains increase a lot I eat them. I have nothing positive or negative to say about it thou.
4,samuel50,351,"Kefir is a fermented milk drink made with kefir grains and is believed to have its origins in the Caucasus Mountains. It is prepared by inoculating cow, goat, or sheep’s milk with kefir grains."
5,Danny33,351,I ate the grains almost everyday when I was making Kefir. Eventually the grain start to multiply faster then you can use them. Some may consider the texture gross but their actually pretty tasty (and very healthy of course).
6,anidstylie,351,"have had this since birth. I had my tonsils out when I was a child because they would not let go of bacteria. They did not think about my stomach flora being off balance. My mother passed down the overbalance in gram negative bacteria candida. My grandma, probally to her. She was an alcholic who drank alot which promotes yeast growth in the stomach. Our parents transmit what they have or do not(as in good bacteria in stomach). The stomach is key to good immune system and must be balanced. As an adult I even GREW yeast on my skin. What is in the stomach comes out on the skin. My candida manifested itself in the form of tinea vesicolor. Patches on my skin that were fungal(yeast). I started to become aware of the way I felt when I ate sugar. I linked the candida to everything I suffered as a child even my supposive ADHD! See when I ate sugar the yeast would release gases and make me spazzzy. I could not concentrate had all the syptoms of ADHD. Well my yeast on my skin was the key. I would eat something and watch my skin. When I would eat suagr any form it woulf get red and raise and grow, as well as I would be up all day and night. I then started to develope allergys to wheat, from the overload of yeast in my system, it made me sensative to alot of stuff.Id get hard bumps on my scalp when Id eat sugar. My ear wax smelled like yeast. Id get yeast infections like crazy.The worst though was how it was spreading all over my BODY! It itched and you could see it,I felt like a growing plague. I tried EVERYTHING those stupid clenses, the diet,coconut oil,garlic,cinnamon nothing worked…and then I got some kefir grains. See kefir grains are probiotics they EAT the candida. They conteract the imbalance in flora in our stomachs. The imbalance fueled by sugar and yeast. EVERYTHING HAS SUGAR and YEAST in it. Okay so like when we eat bread its alive it has yeast, it dont die it mulptiplys like BEBE’s kids. Same thing with the kefir BUT its the good guys so to speak. Its not like yogurt its millions of live strands of probiotics and literally they EAT the candida!!!! I started to notice relief right away. I obtained grains from the kefirlady. You can get some from me to if you like. I also did the diet when I first started absolutly NO SUGAR not even fruit. Not untill I was rebalanced and even then I rairly eat it and its usually fruit form. I also took 5 tablespoons of coconut oil a day. Please dont do what I did and just start out on 5. The die off period was intese and I vomited the first day. Work your way up to that. I also did a garlic clove in the morning and one at night. This will assist in fighting off gram negative bacterias and yeast but leave the postive guys intact(mom nature taking care of us) then I would have kefir milk in the morning and kefir milk in the night. NOT THE CRAP FROM THE STORE. It is sugar and the live starins cannot survive the processing. Im talking the real deal like the grains from tibet. You have to love them and take care of them for they are a LIVING being! I can help you with that as well. I also make everythign with the kefir. Sourkraut,kefir sourdough bread(ITS PROBIOTIC BREAD HEHE)cheese(its probiotic cheese not processed invasive YEAST cheese from store). I make kefir pesto white sauce flaxseed pizza,today i made a kefir alfredo sauce.I have almost NO YEAST on my skin now and I am serine and my head feels so differant, I used to be a spazz. I NEVER get sick now NEVER. I also obtained a kumbucha scoby from the kefir lady and have more probiotics that way.I have several ppl who I have also treated with this method. You can email me directly for I will not be on this forum often. I just had to let people know rebalance the inside get the good put back into you and it never goes away persay cause you need those guys to but the overbalnce is rebalanced!!!

I only knew how to cook about two things before this whole ordeal with food sensitivies/leaky gut/candida started. It’s a pain in the ass but also a blessing in disguise. Learning how to cook is a great skill, and once you get started, you will see that it’s not so bad and that veggies aren’t so bad! Some easy things to start out with are blender soups (cook veggies in water, blend up with coconut oil and garlic – very easy!), stir-fries with good spices/herbs, and roasting veggies in the oven. You can work your way up to salads, which can be a little intimidating!"

0,shayfo,354,"I found this earlier, and thought it might be helpful for those of us who can’t always buy exclusively organic produce. It goes from worst to best in terms of pesticides for 40-something conventionally-grown produce items. http://www.grinningplanet.com/2006/update-2005-05-24/pesticides-in-food.htm"
1,Danny33,354,"Interesting. I like this quote from the article->You’ll note that fruits dominate the list of foods with the most pesticide residue. The main reason for this is that consumers have become very, very picky about fresh produce, and growers have discovered that, from an economic standpoint, it makes sense to douse everything with toxic chemicals so the fruits are completely blemish-free Good thing is if your on the candida diet fruits don’t really fall in diet too much So this shouldn’t concern most. I have never understood the american obsession with perfectly looking aesthetically pleasing food. Its the same reason they bleach white rice and sugar. I have also read recently that the nutrient levels in non-organic produce are really not that different from organic produce. Good news."
2,shayfo,354,"I’ve read the opposite regarding nutrient levels, but I imagine it depends on the farming operation where the produce is grown. Heavily commercialized organics (Trader Joe’s, etc) are likely grown in soil that’s less rich than smaller-scale organics (farmers’ markets, etc), due to demand. Regardless, eating a lot of produce is inherently healthier than NOT eating a lot of produce, so I would say just do your best. Also, the picky-consumer thing is totally true. I help run an organization that makes free meals for the homeless on a weekly basis, and a lot of the donations we receive from farmers at the local farmers markets are “too ugly” to sell: apples with scars, ripped or hole-y swiss chard, peaches that have those weird dents from being poked by a branch early in the growth period, etc. They’re totally fine, but nobody wants to buy them."
0,NXS02,355,"Hello everyone, I have just joined the forum and started investigating candida. I am sad to read of so many people that have terrible symptoms. For myself I think I have had mild cases only a few times a year up until I had my daughter 4 years ago – i believe since then I have had candida the entire time. By chance i visited a homeopathy pharmacy who recommended I start taking Pau d’Arco capsules. 3 days later i think i feel a little better in my stomach anyway. Reading up on pau d’acro has led me to this site and I will start adjusting my diet etc as recommended so hopefully on the way to a healthier inside. What i want to know is: with vaginal candida, it is common to have a bleach type smell – it can be pretty bad dependent on where i am in my cycle. Am i right to think this is linked to Candida? Any thoughts welcome. Thankyou."

I doubt this will help much if at all, but you might try taking that last tablet earlier in the day; maybe one in the morning and one mid-day. If it’s really insomnia you have, you can try treating it with an herb called Ashwagandha (450 mg each) as well as 5HTP (100 mg each). Take three capsules of each every day but start with one capsule and work up to three by adding one of each every three days. Keep in mind that sleep is ultra important in rebuilding the immune system. Able"

0,alexalgebra,359,"Hello! I’m new to the forum. My story is…was diagnosed with gluten and a couple other intolerances about two years ago. Stayed off them religiously, then went traveling for a very stressful two months. Still didnt cheat, but was essentially homeless and not eating well. Came home, nightmare started. First started reacting to soy within a month of my return, then corn, beans, quinoa, veggies!! Got to where all I could have without instant fatigue and brain fog (my main symptoms) was eggs and small amounts of brown rice. My usual naturopath just said stay off what hurts you, but obviously that wasn’t cutting it. Told me to do glutagenics for the leaky gut, which i did, but dont think it helped. New doctor 1 did muscle testing, said parasite, got pooptested and came back with candida. New doc 2 told me to go on the body ecology diet. Ive been on that, plus just finished a round of candidastat (reccd by regular doc, new doc 2said phytostan but its twice as much), plus probiotics (over 100 billion a day, I take 2 mixes), plus hcl and plant enzymes when I feel tummy issues coming on, plus quercitin, plus oregano oil capsules once a day. I have felt a little die off, but not much. Im having less symptoms as long as Ionly eat small meals, but I feel like not much is really happening on the healing front. I am on day 22. I have also lost 15 pounds since I can only manage 600-800 calories a day with so many veggies and food combining snd all. I eat a lot of bieler broth :p (I am vegetarian, not eating meat again ever, please don’t tell me to…also no dairy). It kind of feels like I have just a small amount of candida causing a lor of problems. Can you recommend what would help heal my gut or if there is anything differrnt I should be doing? I can show anyone my food logs on livestrong.com that is interested. I have small amounts of buckwheat and millet and occasionally almond flour, sometimes sprouted then dehydrated pumpkin and sunflower seeds. Otherwise its just veggies and eggs. Have been adding in coconut oil where I can and all foods organic and all water filtered. Sorry for the ramble, just tired of docs telling me conflicting info and not finding relief. Thank you so much for any help."
1,raster,359,How many eggs are you eating daily? Are you eating any high sugar veggies? -raster
2,alexalgebra,359,"1-2 eggs maybe every other day…need protein somehow to function. Some meals are 20% starchy veg like red potato (body ecology says they are low enough in sugar) or pumpkin, but have mostly been staying away from them. I’d say maybe 2-3 meals a week a very small serving. No beets, sweet potatoes, carrots, other squash, etc. No peas or legumes either, since I can’t digest them."
3,UncleOxidant,359,Some meals are 20% starchy veg like red potato (body ecology says they are low enough in sugar) I don’t think that’s true. Potatoes are going to convert to sugar very quickly – high glycemic index. When you say “red potato” are you referring to a regular potato with red skin? I don’t think there’s anything special about them as far as glycemic index goes.
4,alexalgebra,359,"Yes, the small red skin ones. I was wondering about that…ive only had them a couple times since starting the diet, and not much at a time, so I don’t think that’s been a big sabotage, just a little mistake."
5,LESNYC,359,"This is so funny that this is the very first post I’m seeing. I just joined seconds ago because I wanted to know whether I can eat goat cheese on the anti-candida diet. I suffered from leaky gut for years before I knew what it was. Then it was about another 18 months before I came across something that helped. A naturopath recommended a diet for me that included dairy.I told her I can’t tolerate dairy and she suggested goat cheese. Within 1 week of eating fresh, organic goat cheese, my stomach inflammation and leaky gut had improved tremendously. That was 4 months ago. I’ve eaten a small portion, 1 tbl. daily since that time. I did some research and apparently, goat milk molecules are much smaller than cow milk’s. for some reason, goat milk cheese is very good for inflammation (I can’t remember if the same goes for goat milk). I think my leaky gut is gone. Anyway, today is the second day of a super strict diet to combat yeast, bacteria and fungus. I’m only eating nuts, nut butters (no pistachios for now), green leafy veggies, chicken, fish, water — everything organic. I’m unsure about the goat cheese. Maybe is should  eat it for the first week or month…? I’m actually a bit scared to stop eating it, since I was taking it medicinally. Okay, just found this on Livestrong: Certain cheeses are restricted on the candida diet. In general, you must eliminate cheeses aged for more than six months. Aged cheeses contain mold that can trigger candida growth, according to the website Candida Solutions. Therefore, all candida dieters should avoid Blue, Gorgonzola, Roquefort and other cheeses containing mold. Most people suffering from candidiasis can eat goat cheese, Feta, cream cheese or Mozzarella without trouble. Use caution when eating aged Cheddar, Romano or Parmesan cheeses, which can cause candida growth. Great! I’ll stick with a small portion…"
6,raster,359,"In order to heal leaky gut you need to reduce the inflammation of the gut. A diet that is anti-inflammatory will help this, but so will anti-inflammatory supplements such as fermented cod liver oil (or regular). Additionally, I recommend L-Glutamine to heal leaky gut, 500mg per meal. If you eat plenty of foods that contain prebiotics (FOS) this will feed the probiotics in the gut; both heal leaky gut. Prebiotic food examples include buckwheat, teff, artichokes, onions, oat bran, etc. Cinnamon also heals leaky gut, but beware of it because it does damage the liver as well which you need in good shape. There’s a post awhile back that mentions leaky gut supplements: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst3278_Raster-s-Leaky-Gut-List.aspx -raster"

Unfortunately, the truth is that no one knows how long any stage will last. Everyone reacts differently to each stage, everyone makes different mistakes, and we all had or have different degrees of the infestation, so as you can see, it’s impossible to predict how long each stage will last. I can tell you for absolute certainty, that the more mistakes you make during the treatment, the longer each stage will last. Oil pulling will help the coating on your tongue.

0,MC1912,362,"So…. I’m pretty sure I’ve had candida for years but within the last year it has gotten annoyingly worse! in February of this year I went to the doctor because I was having burning itching down stairs. Doc did an exam.. Result yeast infection, which was strange to me because it wasn’t a normal yeast infection like I’ve had in the past. This was on the outside of my skin and I wasn’t having the thick discharge like I normally would. My doc gave me the yeast pill and everything went away. Then it kept coming back so I would self treat and I would feel better, but it would keep coming back. So I went to the doctor again and she checked me and result yeast infection again and BV. I got medicine for both. Except what I didn’t realize at the time was that BV treat was antibiotics. I took the antibiotic and I felt a lot better for a little while and then it all came back and it came back worse! And I notice that time why it came back. I ate a chocolate kiss or two and the next day I had a yeast problem again. Since my doctors weren’t helping me I did my own research and how candida overgrowth. I noticed all my symptoms I’ve been having for years are the result of candida. Consistent sinus head aches, feeling tried all the time, depressed, constant gas and boating, ect. I did the candida diet for about a month over the summer and I felt a lot better. But I lapsed and started eating some of my regular foods. And it all came back! Eh….. I take a probiotic for my vj which helps a lot, which it allowed me to notice where the problem was coming from my butt. The yeast is in my stomach and when I have a BM it is coming out and yeast is getting onto my skin and traveling up into my vj. I went to the doctor again a couple months ago and I had blood test done. He tested me for a stomach disease, white cell blood count and antibodies.Everything came back normal. How can this be? At least the blood test showed my immune system is working well and I’m not sick in any way. But I’m super annoyed because every time I eat anything sugar it gets worse. I got some pills called candex which have worked well but not well enough. I’m tired of this diet. I’m tired of having this issue. I want to drink coffee or have cookie if I please.. I did notice when I was on the diet my skin cleared up, I had less gas, no yeast infections, no sinus headaches ect. A few weeks ago I did a professional colon cleanse and I noticed the next day that my glan in my armpit swelled up huge and it hurt really bad. Well two things consist of what causes that and one is fungus and the other leukemia. Since my white blood cell count was normal I know it’s not leukemia and I’m not sick at all. I feel fine for the most part I just have itching burning in the butt….. And the skin around it. I want to keep taking this candex and do the diet for a while longer but the stuff costs 50$ a bottle. I’m debating if I should see another doctor and take my blood work with me so I don’t have to go thru that mess again. I don’t know what to do… I want to believe doctors know what there doing but a lot of them aren’t believers and I need a believer to help me treat this …. Help!!!!!"
1,tlentz1108,362,"Hi, in my experience you can’t rely on tests. Sometimes they come back false negative and I’m afraid my opinion of doctors is pretty bad as well. My doctor’s have treated individual health symptoms for over 25 years without ever diagnosing me with candida and I only got worse and worse. It wasn’t until I got fed up, self-diagnosed and began treatment that I began to improve. I have improved at least 80% of my original symptoms of GERD, seasonal allergies, IBS, high blood pressure, migraines, Eosinophilic Esophagitis, Diabetes, thyroid and adrenal probems, recurring broncitis, easy bruising and excessive bleeding when cut, recurring UTI’s, gall bladder attacks, etc. Most of us are tired of fighting and not being able to eat what we want, but unfortunately this isn’t something you get over quickly. It is likely, that you only killed the candida on the surface temporarily, but internally the Candida just went deeper to wait and hide out until conditions were ripe to come back out. Right now, I am fighting a skin fungus infection that isn’t quite going away. I have been spraying the area topically with hydrogen peroxide 3-4 times a day for the past week and half. It is improving, and hopefully will be gone in the next few weeks. I have heard that it can take several weeks to a few months using these topical treatments, but it may come back afterwards because I know that the Candida overgrowth is still there internally hidden. I am also taking other natural anti-fungals internally like coconut oil, garlic, onions, jalepenos, gse,turmeric, yucca, oil of oregano, olive leaf, and others. All except the coconut oil, I rotate regularly. Besides all the vitamins, omegas, probiotics, etc that I take as well. Boron has really helped my pain from athritis(which can be related with candida), and is listed also as an anti-fungal. Don’t know the full answer yet to totally eradicating this monster, but quitting the diet won’t help. We all would love to not worry about what we eat, but in my experience cheats are often followed up with a return of debilitating symptoms and skin infections. I have tried some of these products like Candex, but they only helped marginally and are very expensive. Some may not approve of colloidal silver, but I have been using this the past week when I got a sore throat and my oral thrush started coming back. I just spray it inside my mouth, on my tongue, under my tongue, on each side of my cheeks and towards the back of my throat. I sprayed some in my nostrils to help with my cold symptoms as well, and I got over my cold a lot faster. No side effects that I can see, it helped the white coating on my tongue, my sore throat went away and I wan’t sneezing and blowing my nose as much. I think if colloidal silver is used minimally and infrequently that most problems won’t occur. Supposedly, you can use this topically on skin rashes as well. Might try it if the hydrogen peroxide doesn’t do the trick. Anyway, hang in there. Everyone here is in the same boat. Keep researching, seeking answers, and sharing information that may help someone else. Well wishes, Teresa"
2,MC1912,362,See that’s the thing I don’t have a rash yet I suppose form the candida on my skin. I’m thinking about trying hydrogen peroxide on my skin down there to try and kill it. I usually just use anti fungus creams and they work really well. Have you tried or heard of fluconazole. I read that talking it for 14 days twice a day I believe is suppose to correct the problem all together. But see how do you get a doctor to give it to you when you can get a positive test for it. Dr oz suggest this medication as well. I think I will try and get a prescription for it but we will see
3,tlentz1108,362,"Yeah, you’d have to get a doctor to prescribe it and if a test doesn’t come up positive, they won’t give you one. Sorry, I don’t go to doctors much anymore unless it’s an emergency since I don’t have much faith in them treating Candida. I usually always try a natural herbal route. If the yeast is vaginal, you can try some natural anti-fungals vaginally if the OTC ones aren’t helping. I believe Able or Raster listed some on the site that they collected from other women members in the past that you could run a search in the search box above. I think one of them was using probiotics. I’m sure one of them may see your post and provide the link or message(s) for you to check out. My skin fungus infection is on the side of my groin and thigh, so it does make it easier to treat topically. Best of luck, Teresa"
4,samuel50,362,If OTC doesn’t help you then go ahead with prescribed medicines. Check with other doctor too.

The only time i have been eating them is in the morning. eg wholegrain brown rice, quinoa, buckwheat. should i be cutting them out completely. i have a food intolerance to eggs just not sure what i should be eating in the morning. thank you"

0,dt1963,367,"Hi my name is Diane. Been suffering for at least 2 decades and have gone on candida diets numerous times only to fall back into poor diets and health. I am ready to do it again now. I have consulted by phone with this “modern herbalist” online guy who has his own protocol and supplemenmts. For the first 8 weeks the supps cost is $369, then the next 10 weeks is 2 hundred something. Is this resonable number one, number 2 should I go with him? I’m skepticle cause I’ve heard so much discrepancies. Dont do this but do that ect.. This guy says green tea, yerbe mate,goat cheese (if not aged but soft), stevia, vegtable glycerine, matcha powder,is ok. And NO to: all fruit,corn, grains, beans, lentils (unless very small ammt) and ALL meat MUST be organic and free of all hormones. This is very difficult and expensive. But if thats the only way fine I’ll do what I gotta do. But is caffeine allowed? coffee? iced tea, xyletol, stevia, veg glycerine, and grains, brown rice, ezekial tortillas? I just want to do it RIGHT this time instead of messing up. He also says its important to alternate supps. Do we become immune? Im lost in so much info I just need help sorting out what really works from the experts here. Please help me someone! Thanks in advance! :)Diane By the way the supps he recomding are: Berbercap, Candi-B, Candida rotation protocol, olive leave extract, paramicrocidin, phellstatin, sf722, tricycicline, syntol, yeast formula. Also recomd’s HCL"
1,raster,367,"His food list sounds pretty right on except for maybe goat cheese. If you think you can while eating GMO or non-organic, I will tell you otherwise. You can have bad things in moderation, but certainly not everyday. Caffeine should not be consumed because it damages the liver and kidneys and also drains the adrenals which you need for your immune system. I am unsure if his supplement list is the best. SF722 is a great supplement but haven’t tried anything else on your list other than HCL which is important for digestion. -raster"

0,toni8,369, I Just got back from my local clinic and asked them to do a Candida test but they basically said that such a thing doesn’t exist? does anybody know about this? is it really true? thanks for any answers or leads you may have! 🙂
1,raster,369,I believe there is one called the candida immune complex test from genova diagnostics. There is also a stool test you can take called the stool effects test with genova. You can also get tested at an allergist to see if you are allergic to candida. Metametrix labs also has some tests as well as a few other places. You just need one I believe. -raster

0,ginger,370,"I am a 33 year old female. I think I may be suffering from a candida overgrowth. I was just diagnosed with a bacterial infection in what is left of my tonsils (put on a z pack) as well as yeast in my throat (put on nataxan mouthwash). I’ve had two urinary infections this year (only one other before). I’ve been losing weight and, though not dangerously underweight, I can’t really afford to lose more. I also have had a vaginal bacterial infection (just got off antibiotic for that two weeks ago). I have a lot of the symptoms described by candida overgrowth sites. My white blood cell count is in the low range as well. I have itchiness, a lot of stomach pains and horrible mentrual cycles. My typical day of eating looks like: about of cup of cereal (no milk) in the morning, 9-10 raw carrots wtih 2-3 tablespoons of peanut butter, some fruit and some veggie chips or tortilla chips in the afternoon and a spinach muffin or other carbs (I know, bad) later in the afternoon. Then half a sandwich and some veggies and fruit for dinner and a frappachino (also awful I know) and some cereal before bed. I am on synthroid for hypothyroidism most of my life, prilosec for about one year (for what the ent diagnosed as GERD, but perhaps may be related to the candida as well as a hiatal hernia) and fluoxetine. I nee dto work on this overgrowth, and have seen diet plans, but I’m afraid that on one of those diets, I may lose even more weight. I do not eat red meat or fish.

Or suitable alternatives?? In the past I’ve used Nystatin which gave me terrible die-off and TERRIBLE die-off is NOT an option! Am happy to feel a bit rubbish for a month or two but am a self employed musician and NOT working is NOT an option…I only wish it was. I’ve been on the Grapefruit-seed extract for a while but its not really doing the trick. I know how to handle the diet (NOT easy though AND am a veggie who has an intolerance to dairy)…. Will get on the raw garlic ASAP and am already taking Acidophilous. Thanks all in advance. Si x"
1,raster,371,"Hello qunvat, I think your mentality with how to defeat candida is not the best approach for healing from a debilitating illness. Taking more antifungals will not cure any infection, all it does is kill candida. You simply cannot kill off all of the candida within the body; if you did you would die! You need to change the environment within the body to make it inhospitable for candida to thrive. This requires quite a few changes that go beyond taking an enzyme product and antifungals. Candigest looks like an OK enzyme product but it certainly will not cure your infestation as well as any antifungal. The single most important thing you need to cure your infestation is probiotics; taking one strain of probiotics is simply not good enough. We recommend a high strain high count probiotic that contains DDS-1 or human micro flora (HMF) which should be an upgrade over what you currently take. The enzyme product you chose is one of the many of products out there that work in the same way. I take one called pro-gest which you likely will find to be superior to candigest. I can name over a dozen other enzyme products out there but I feel progest is one of the best. There is also another one I tried for awhile called zymex II by standard process. I believe this one is focused on treating the small intestine. Additionally, it appears you are not doing anything to protect your liver and kidneys from die-off toxins which is very essential in order to get over this first stage of your treatment. If you have such debilitating die-off, you likely need to heal your liver and kidneys before starting an anti-candida treatment. A naturopath can do this or you can do it yourself; milk thistle is a great healing herb for the liver and there are many other ways to heal it as well. A great antifungal I recommend over and over on the forum is SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne which should greatly reduce die-off and also change the environment within the intestines to make it less hospitable for candida to live. What are your symptoms? What other supplements are you taking? What is your diet like? -raster"
2,qunvat,371,"Hi Raster, Thanks. As an anti-fungal how / why would SF722 give me LESS die-off? (I’ve been thru die-off many times via Nystatin and at times Grapefruit-seed extract)…. I dont mind die-off but I’d need to manage it…going onstage to perform is not an option (with die-off),so I’d need to ease off the anti-fungal of choice a day or two before a concert. Is progest available in the UK?? I take a quality Acidphilous at the moment but am very willing to upgrade it. My diet is vegetarian and fairly good and have toyed with Candida diets for over 25 years so I know whats in front of me. I simply want to manage my symptoms / keep it at bay and not necessarily beat it for good as I know this is very very difficult, especially with the life of a self employed musician. Current symptoms (I’ve had most over the years) are fatigue / low thyroid and adrenal function / hypoglycemia and panic attacks…I could go on, but you know the score!

0,Rachel_Healing,373,"Hi all, I finally decided to register for this website and submit myself to the cleanse after months of consideration. I have visited here at a friend’s suggestion and adopted some of the antifungal regimens and detox drinks. I stopped drinking caffeine, started eating loads of fresh vegetables. I tried to jump into stage 2 of the diet, lasted a week, felt great, but fell back into my old sugar/gluten routine. I’m still addicted to sugar and I crave it constantly. I would eat sugar all day everyday if I could. This week I got another UTI—perhaps my fourth in a year? It was so severe I had to leave work for three days. I was urinating blood, had a fever etc, but I refuse to go to the doctor and take anti-biotics because I suspect this will cause more systemic problems in my body. I was able to stop most of the pain and flush the bleeding with a TON of water and cranberry juice, then Sanjin, a Chinese herb, and baking soda to neutralize the acid in my urine. These UTIs are SO PAINFUL they feel as if you are urinating little pieces of glass. If anyone has had one of these, you know what I am talking about. NO MORE. Something’s gotta give. Granted, I was not entirely following the protocol for avoiding UTIs, but it seems like I have to be PERFECT in this respect to avoid them and even then sometimes I get one. Am I silly not to go to the doctor for a stiff round of antibiotics? I don’t want to promote more yeast infections on top of this UTI infection. Another reason I am motivated to try this diet is that I have vitiligo which has spread from the back of my neck, into my hair and in parts of my face. I use a lot of sunscreen so it’s difficult to notice in the winter, but the condition affects me psychologically. It’s depressing. I don’t feel as pretty as I used to and I can’t ever get back my gorgeous tan. I can’t go and enjoy the beach like normal people! Also, I have suffered from hyperhydrosis since I was a child which makes it impossible for me to wear sandals. Quite understandably, summer is not my favorite time of year. All this said, my hyperhydrosis does seems a bit better now that I mostly stopped eating gluten. Am I imagining this? Another symptom is acne—nothing severe, just little bumps under the surface of my skin, my jaw line and usually one or two big noticeable pimples. About two years ago, I followed an extremely healthy diet, not gluten free, but little sugar or alcohol and my pictures from that time show a much smoother and clearer skin. I WAS on the pill at that time which could be responsible but I DO NOT wish to continue filling my body with fake hormones. I don’t know what the eventual consequence of this will be. In terms of the “brain fog” symptoms of Candida, I don’t know what that is, specifically. I am easily distracted, people describe me as “spacey”, but I don’t know if I can contribute this to a yeast overgrowth, rather a lack of discipline and internal focus. Any stories or helpful comments about conquering vitiligo, UTIs, yeast infections, acne, or sugar cravings through the Candida cleanse and diet would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
1,tlentz1108,373,"Hi Rachel, Back last Oct 2011 I had a severe kidney, bladder, uti infection that antibiotics would not help. After suffering for a month and the antibiotics failed, I researched the internet and found out about a product called D-mannose w/cranactin. I did try cranberry juice and supplements first that didn’t help. In desperation and much pain, I tried D-mannose w/cranactin and it did clear up my infection. This was before I found out that I had candidias. There is some debate whether D-mannose will feed candida or not. D-mannose is a form of sugar but it is not metabolized in the same way, and is excreted by the kidneys. Some believe that bacteria (particulary E-Coli) and possibly candida bind to the D-mannose and are then excreted out. Not sure that there is any scientific proof of this, but I know that it definitely helped my infection. If you google it, you will find differing opinions and experiences some in favor others not. I was in such a desparate state and it was a priority to clear up my infection, that I took it. In my case it definitely cured my infection and I haven’t had one since. But, then I came down with such a severe case of candidias also. This probably was due more to the fact that I was on antibiotics long term several times within six months for various infections. I am opening this up to a topic of discussion as to the pros and cons of using this for uti’s. Anybody have any information on this about how it affects candida? Also, I heard that alicin (spelling?) may help with uti’s as well. All the best, Teresa"
2,gonzosheba,373,"I had re-occuring yeast infections for 2 years. That is how I determined I had a candida problem. I found a simple technique to fight the yeast infections. Take a clove of organic garlic, peal it (making certain not to nick the surface), then insert it into your vagina. This method, though somewhat strange has stopped my YI symptoms in their tracks. It is best to change the garlic every 2-4 hours. The more you change it, the better it works."

I was terribly dizzy, and there was no die off or very great impact on the ringing in my ears. I’m someone who is willing to try extremes, but putting Oregano oil in your ear is nothing but dangerous and stupid. Two questions for the people looking at this: 1.

0,ILLaViTaR,376,"Hey I’ve been on the diet for 3 days amd I do feel so much better (like my body has switched off). Anyway I’m not even sure if I have candida??? I have like 95% of symptoms for candida and adrenal fatigue and could be diagnosed 6 times over for both, but I’ve had no die off symptoms and really I just feel like I’m being attacked when I’m not on the diet. I constantly feel like I have a bomb in my stomach, and feel gross, and kind’ve stoned I guess!  There’s always ups and downs of neseua throughout the day, burping out wet air in tight acidic like bouts, and I wake up with explosive diaherria every day without fail for the last 5 years (have to go within 30 minutes of waking. With casein/gluten it’s far worse, and this actually wakes me up from my sleep and I have to instantly go. There’s no way to hold it, not even if the fate of the world depended on it lol. the pain is so unbearable to the point of not being able to stand up, then I’ll have days where it barely hurts me no different to sugars and preservatives and crap (explain that one lol). But I’m on day 3 and there’s no die off or anything (I’m not feeling worse that’s for sure), I swear I’m dizzier and have a shorter fuse (happens on days anyways even when I’m eating sugar) and that’s about it it’s far too subtle to tell anyway. I still have had diarrhea but I remember last year when I went on the diet this sort’ve stopped/improved and felt so much better, I definitely wasn’t forced to go to the toilet. Every time I start the diet, the same thing happens, all the flatulence/crazy abdominal activity complete ceases, it feels like I don’t even have digestive system inside me as though it’s been surgically removed I can’t feel my stomach, I can’t describe how amazing it feels to feel absolutely no activity at all I didn’t even think it was normal for healthy people, feels too perfect. All the other times I started the diet I didn’t go toilet at all for the first day or 2 which was so scary considering I routinely do without choice 30min everyday after waking, this time is the only time I’ve still had diarrhea, I usually get constipated 2 days after starting it maybe it’s just late this time. I’ve also noticed that for some reason I need to go toilet more than once a day once I start the diet (after the constipation phase). Only other times this happens is when I’m poisoned by gluten/dairy Sorry if this seems hard to read, looking at this screen for so long has made me incredibly dizzy!! So does anyone think I have candida or possibly something else? I feel I do but this die off feels very unorthodox, and there’s no static connection to anything, sometimes I’ll eat sugar get no reaction, then I will, or I will 2 days later you know, it’s too confusing!!! Any help would be greatly appreciated!!"
1,jameskep,376,"The constant diarrhea sounds like intestinal bad bacterial overgrowth. Excess bad bacteria usually causes diarrhea(bad acid production), whereas candida will cause constipation. The condition might be coupled with some yeast overgrowth. You might need to get some testing done to help determine your gut flora. Sounds like a gut flora imbalance. Downsize the pathogens and try to rebuild the good flora. Not an easy task. You feeling kind of stoned can be from the excess of ammonia that the bad bacteria is producing. Casein and gluten become even harder to digest when you don’t have the necessary certain strains of good bacteria to help break it down properly. Might be a good idea to limit the high ammonia producing foods. Its Been my experience that protein shakes and harder to digest meats/dairy can contribute to higher ammonia levels."
2,Vyla,376,"If you seem to no longer have symptoms when you are on a candida diet, you may have severe food allergies. An elimination diet is the best way to find out if food allergies are an issue. There may be ingredients or food groups absent from the candida diet that you happen to be allergic too. And therefore you feel better when those foods are eliminated. I would normally jump to assuming it’s a bacterial imbalance, but if it was that, I would think you have the symptoms even on the candida diet. With a bacterial imbalance that severe, I would think you’d need more than a diet change to see results that drastic. But I’m just guessing… If you have an intolerance to dairy and/or gluten, a minuscule amount of either one can cause drastic symptoms. Mere traces can be a huge problem for some people. If you ever eat out, cross contamination can be a problem. For instance, you choose a gluten free meal at a restaurant, however they cook the food in a wok that has traces of soy sauce on it and therefore gluten gets in the food anyway. I’ve found with a gluten intolerance, I only do well if I eat at home in order make sure there is absolutely none of it. Gluten can be hidden in many foods (soups, salad dressings, sauces) and anything with modified food starch or even caramel coloring could contain gluten. I would completely eliminate dairy and gluten (maybe even eggs, which are a common allergen), even traces of it, and see if this helps. In addition, gluten is like gum in your body. It will stick to your intestines and continue to irritate your system long after you’ve eaten it. If someone eats gluten only once, they can have a reaction for an entire week because it takes that long to leave the system. Gluten can cause brain fog as well, so the spacey feeling you experience could be that. I highly suggest a supplement such a psyllium hulls if you are still having the diarrhea. Psyllium can also grab onto the gluten or allergen that has stuck to your intestinal walls, and carry it out of your system. Having diarrhea this long can cause severe nutritional deficiencies. Psyllium is wonderful for this and so is ginger. Even if you can’t find out the cause right away, using supplements to curb the symptoms is important because it’s incredibly hard on the body to have diarrhea for even a couple days. Your mineral levels decrease horribly and they are very important for basic health processes. Some supplements can cause diarrhea as well. Magnesium is famous for causing that problem and large amounts of vitamin C as well. If you are taking either of these, try stopping them for a week and see what happens…I ran into this problem myself with magnesium but because it was intermittent, I didn’t suspect it for quite a while. A few days after I stopped the magnesium, the problem went away. Sorry if you already know everything I’ve just said. 🙂 I figured I should cover all the major bases in case you haven’t look into some of this info yet. 🙂 Candida is a sneaky condition and tends to not be very predictable, so that very well may be your issue…"

I also woke up today and it hasn’t grown back, tongue is still nice and red. I can’t thank you guys enough for the input!!! I really appreciate it!! edit: 12hrs after brushing and it’s already grown back lol, is this normal?"

0,Dia,378,"About a month ago I started a strict diet of no sugars, except xylitol and stevia. I also limited my starchy vegetables, and no dairy, gluten, soy, alcohol, etc. I limited my starches to quinoa, minimal brown rice and millet about 2-3 times a week. I took some colon cleanse supplement, liver support supplement, a probiotic, and began cleansing with diet. About 2 weeks in I felt amazing, was having regular bowel movements, and felt on top of the world. I started having a Chinese medicine massage called chi nei tsang. It is basically a light massage of the stomach only that is supposed to help getting our chi unstuck in our stomach, intestines, lives, spleen, etc. it was amazing! I did experience some die off from the massage. I had crazy bloating and distended stomach for a day or so after, but it felt like things had really started to move around in my gut and to improve circulation and promote natural healing there. Uponf recommendation of my doctor and many, I decided the last step of my cleanse should be a colonic, before I started the antifungals. The day of my colonic I began taking d-lenolate or olive leaf extract. I had been previously taking candex, a bunch of enzymes that supposedly help break down the walls of the candida cels. Anyways, what followed has been difficult. The colonic, my 4th time ever, and not my favorite thing, went seemingly well. However, as soon as I got home, I started to have this intense pain underneath my right rib cage, and my stomach felt really wrong. I just lied on my side and could feel something gurgling and almost draining sensation. My basic knowledge and some experience from doctors and accupuncturists lead me to believe that it was either my liver or my gall bladder working overtime. I was in so much pain that I couldn’t move. So I slept it off, and continued to have extremely loose stools the entire night. I also noticed some white stuff coming out tinged with blood. The next morning I woke up nauscious and vomited. I went to see my doctor and he said that my liver was probably working overtime and it was hard to tell if it was from the colonic, olive leaf extract, or both.. So he gave me a bunch of liver support vitamins. Since then, I’ve improved, but not back to 100% of what I was before the colonic. I’m still getting stomach gas, bloating, neck pain, shoulder pain, aching joints, and constipation, and pain and discomfort under my right ribcage, liver/gallbladder area. So about a week ago I stopped the olive leaf extract. I do have a mild intolerance to olives, and my concern is that it was causing some of my old symptoms of stomach pain, etc… But my question is, how do I know if my reaction was die off, or allergy related to the olive leaf extract? Intuitively I feel like it was allergy, because of the amount and localization of pain, very similar to pre diet, but then again, I don’t reality know what die off feels like.. Would anyone recommend that I move onto other antifungals? Or maybe do a liver gallbladder cleanse first? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I’m just not sure what to do next as my body is obviously having a hard time processing whatever the colonic stirred up.. So I’m not sure if I should ease off a little until my liver/gallbladder feel back to normal, or if this is just normal die-off?"
1,Doggiemama,378,well i wont be of much help other than..i take Milk Thistle for my liver. it helps to repair it. i would recommend that. it does sound sorta like an allergy to me. die off is all the symptoms you had prior to starting your diet..but possibly alot worse.
2,Doggiemama,378,"Milk Thistle Extract One of the questions that we’re most often asked is “How do I cope with Candida Die-Off?” Die-Off can be a combination of headaches, nausea, breakouts and many other symptoms, and unfortunately its the number one reason why people give up their Candida treatment. An herb named Milk Thistle can help, and you can take it all through your treatment. Your body needs all the support it can get to reduce the effects of Die-Off, and that’s where Milk Thistle comes in. It is a natural supplement that both repairs your liver and protects it from future damage. What happens during Candida Die-Off? Candida Die-Off (otherwise know as a Herxheimer reaction) occurs when the Candida yeast cells are rapidly killed. This might be due to the probiotics you are taking, or perhaps you started a course of antifungals. Either way, as the yeast cells are killed they release a selection of nasty toxins into your bloodstream. These toxins accumulate in your system faster than your body can remove them, resulting in the usual Die-Off symptoms like headache, fever, muscle pain and brain fog.  When the Candida yeast is killed it can actually release up to 79 different toxins, of which the most important are Ethanol and Acetaldehyde. If your liver can’t act fast enough to remove them, these become responsible for a wide range of Die-Off symptoms. How does Milk Thistle help? You can see the importance of a healthy, functioning liver if you want to minimize the effects of Die-Off. That’s why Milk Thistle is such a useful supplement for Candida sufferers. Here’s how Milk Thistle supports your liver. The active ingredient in Milk Thistle is Silymarin, which is actually a group of phytochemical compounds named flavonolignands. These compounds help your liver in a number of ways. Firstly, Silymarin stimulates protein synthesis in your liver, helping to repair damaged liver cells and restoring their function. Secondly, it actively protects your liver cells by making changes to the cell membranes. This prevents toxins from entering the cells. And thirdly, Silymarin encourages the growth of new liver cells.  Its important to realize that Milk Thistle is no ‘quack’ cure. It is regularly used for cirrhosis, liver poisoning and viral hepatitis. It’s liver-protecting properties as widely accepted in the medical community.  What is Milk Thistle? Milk Thistle is a flowering plant, originally from the Mediterranean. It has been used as a liver tonic for at least 2000 years, Other possible (but as yet unproven) medical uses are for reducing the growth rate of cancer cells, lowering cholesterol and reducing insulin resistance in Type 2 Diabetes. There is even some evidence to suggest that Milk Thistle may help you recover from a nasty hangover!"

0,turkishdelight,379,"I am just starting on my candida diet. I do not have any problems with my stomach such as bloating, indigestion, sensitivity etc. So surely then it is ok to eat gluten and wheat but preferably whole meal and whole wheat? My sensitivity is my nose/ears and headaches. I also feel very heavy and weak and worn out physically all of the time and it has been that way for decades. I have also read that it is ok to have yeast if it is cooked, i.e. toasted bread. And cheese if it is cooked. My main question please is this. I understand we cannot have sugar because it feeds the yeast but what about if we are buying something that only has about 1% sugar? Is this tiny amount acceptable? If we are not eating anything that includes then would a small amount of sugar be ok because there is nothing there to feed? I am taking various supplements and finding all of this confusing, very time consuming and trying my best. I live in the UK where doctors do not accept that there is such a thing as candida and would just give you more anti biotics and steroids, which I am sure made the problem or at least made it worse in the first place."
1,raster,379,"If you are serious about fighting candida, then you will abstain from wheat, cheese, and yeast. If you are not serious about fighting candida then you will eat a diet that is “more” healthy than you current one but not good enough to get better. Cheese contains a type of sugar called lactose and candida can feed on this just as easily as other forms of sugar such as sucrose or glucose. This is not a sugar elimination diet because sugar exists in nearly all foods. This is a low sugar diet where you only eat natural forms of sugar that exist in vegetables and other foods, etc. There is about 3g of sugar in a head of lettuce. There is about 5g of sugar in a red onion. You need these foods to survive, so you have to eat sugar. But this doesn’t mean you should go out and eat white sugar, cane sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc. Its all the same pretty much and all are bad for the diet. We also feel that certain foods should be reduced as well. This includes molds (in nuts and seeds), dairy (lactose), starch (carrots, potatoes, corn, etc), high GI (glycemic index) foods, grains, etc. We have a strict forum food list if you are interested. If so, email able900 for a link. You are welcome to experiment of course but many of us have already done that and went to the strict food list. -raster"
2,turkishdelight,379,"Thank you very much for this. So you are telling me not to eat goats or sheeps cheese. Fair enough. Please tell me, bearing in mind that I am not allergic to anything and have no sensitivy in stomach – is it ok to have tiny amounts of sugar in, for example, some guacamole? Is it ok to have something which has tiny amounts of yeast in it?"
3,flailingWcandi,379,"turkishdelight;29320 wrote: Please tell me, bearing in mind that I am not allergic to anything and have no sensitivy in stomach You are correct: dealing with candida and related symptoms/syndromes is mind boggling. My hunch is your ears/nose and headaches are candida related as some people feel sinus infections are more typically yeast/candida than bacterial and perhaps a form of an allergic reaction due to candida caused leaky gut. When candida turns fungal it bores through the intestinal pores to enter the blood stream. The mycotoxins strain your immune system. Large molecule food particles can now pass through the enlarged intestinal pores which the body mounts an immune response to ‘invaders’. This strains the immune system further dealing with a type of false allergic response due to the food molecule size with every bite. The combo puts a strain on the adrenal/thyroid systems since they regulate much of the immune response. I suspect, if you took your body temps, particularly the basal temp (temp upon waking) they would be low which is a red flag to adrenal fatigue/hypothyroid. Everyone who has complained about sinus issues which I also suffer from, have reported back low body temps even if they didn’t realize it prior. A lot of tail chasing here but, the more I seek the more convinced I am of how intertwined endocrine dysfunction is with candida: a which came first scenario. Supporting the adrenals/thyroids is built into this forum’s protocol: albeit subtly but, again they are all intertwined with issues like diet, vit/mins, iron, iodine, etc…."
4,turkishdelight,379,"Thank you so much for this. I had sort of calculated that I probably had leaky gut and this had caused the sinus/headaches/ears etc. I also have coated white tongue and bad teeth. I am also sure that it has only gone or become manageable since taking lots of vitamin c and garlic. But I have read too that having a lot of garlic can cause thyroid problems – lack of energy with some.I am soon to start taking curcumin, large doses of vitamin b, already taking kelp and selenium and pro biotics. I would like to know please if it is ok to sometimes have tiny amounts of sugar if you are buying for example a pre prepared sandwich paste which has a miniscule amount in it. If it is ok to have cheese if it is goats or sheep or lactose free? If it is ok to have bread if it is just now and then and no yeast or kill the yeast by toasting? I want to do this right but I also do not want to eat horrible food all of the time if I can have something nice sometimes, or buy lots of expensive stuff if it is a waste of money! I will be getting more vegetables – I never ate them before! and cutting out fruits. Is it ok to have potatoes if you do not eat the skins or make sure they are well washed first? I love potatoes."
5,Jo*Jo,379,"Turkish, if you want to rid yourself of candida, follow the forum diet and dont eat anything else thats not on it. Sandwich paste is processed and even small amounts will probably feeding the candida. I love potatoes too but I’ve not had one in six months because i want to be well again. I dont eat “horrible food” all the time either. Its a really healthy diet and as you progress, you add more and more foods. Like rewarding yourself. Maybe try to see it that way. Rewarding yourself for getting rid of the symptoms. Perhaps it is hard to get your head around but its either you want to get well or you want to eat processed and candida loving foods and be sick."
6,actress11,379,I’m STARVING too on the cleansing portion – it’s hard to believe I don’t see more people complaining!!!!
7,Able900,379,"Try to understand that the goal of a workable Candida treatment is to destroy as many Candida as possible while working to change the environment of the intestines, stomach, and colon to an environment that will not sustain the existence of a Candida albicans overgrowth. To feed the Candida during this long process is to defeat the purpose of the entire treatment. Foods that must be avoided in order to stop feeding the Candida are: all sugars, specifically sucrose, fructose, lactose, and any food that will turn into sugar once it has been eaten. This includes such foods as starches and other foods that can change into sugar in the body such as carbohydrates (wheat, etc). It also includes sugar alcohols such as sucralose (Splenda) and also the imitation sweetener, Aspartame (NutraSweet, Equal). Yeast should also be left out of the diet. Sugar is found naturally in most vegetables that you will need to eat, therefore any other foods containing sugar should be avoided. So as you see, the problem is not an allergy to these foods, and it’s not a problem with the stomach or bloating; the problem is feeding the pathogens you’re trying to destroy.  There is a complete diet available to forum members; if you’d like to have a copy, send a private message to me on the forum. Don’t feel bad about your UK doctors; for the most part, doctors here in the US also refuse to believe in a Candida albicans infestation. Many of us, including myself, have treated and cured our infestation without ever consulting a doctor. Able"

They’re simply some of the things I’ve started doing to help myself. I’m working on getting some heavy metals out of my system as well as ridding myself of my Candida, and I’m not entirely sure which of these two issues is helped by the Rooibos, but it does make me feel substantially better. I bought a caffeine-free chai & rooibos blend and it definitely alleviates my symptoms. If you haven’t looked into heavy metal detoxing for your Candida, I recommend doing so. Personally, starting a heavy metal detox helped me turn a HUGE corner with my Candida. If you feel ‘stuck’, it might help to try some heavy metal detox stuff and see if it helps. Also making a HUGE difference is the use of coconut oil as lube. I used to feel that sex ALWAYS greatly aggravated the vaginal aspect of my candida, but now with the coconut oil I feel like I’m fighting yeast WHILE having sex. It’s great! and I like the coconut oil more than other lubes anyways because it doesn’t get dry or sticky and it feels very natural. Alright so here are my three current tips: 1. Rooibos tea 2. Heavy Metal Detoxing 3. Coconut Oil as Lube Have any of you tried these things? Do they work for you? Post any other products or ideas that have been helpful to you recently here!"

I deliberately left nuts off the diet because of several negative reactions I myself received from various types of nuts each time I tried them. Every time I tested them, I experienced Candida-like symptoms; in other words, my Candida always grew worse within several hours of eating them. This can only mean that nuts are in some way beneficial to the Candida. If anyone insists on eating nuts during the treatment, I would advise to test them first before eating more than a few and to purchase only organic nuts. However, I would still expect problems from them, if not soon after eating them, certainly in the long run. Also, if you will roast the nuts first, this would probably present less of a problematic situation.4. Soap.

2,Ms T,384,"Thanks so much for the reply, Able, as well as for all else that you do. Because it’s going to be pretty near impossible for me to make yogurt and kefir at home, I’ve started reading the labels of commercial products more closely. I was eating goat’s milk yogurt and kefir, but I see that both have pectin, which is a polysaccharide. I’m guessing that’s a problem, right? I did not eat the Greek yogurt because it’s so creamy that right now the thought of it makes me sick. Maybe it’s the amount of casein in it, because I know goat’s milk has the same amount of lactose as cow’s milk. I think I can start eating Greek yogurt again slowly, if that’s really the best option. However, today, I found a commercial goat’s milk yogurt and another kefir that do not contain pectin. Am I right in looking to eliminate pectin from the commercial products I ingest? Of course, I have been buying the plain goat’s milk yogurt without fruit, honey, or sugar. Some others things occurred to me and figure that I will just add them here rather than post yet another “questions” post. My first new question is about how to gauge the severity of a food reation, ie, what constitutes an allergic reaction to food? For example, I have been thinking that burping a lot after eating something is an allergic reaction but perhaps not as severe as feeling nauseous. Still, I think that in the early phases of the diet, this is probably enough to indicate that one should hold off on eating the food that’s causing the burps….Do you rank reactions to food or, in the early stages, is any reaction severe enough to exclude until a later time? Second, this may sound paranoid, but I don’t think I am alone in considering the water supply — ie, tap water. Here, in DC, if the downstairs toilet goes unused and uncleaned for a week, mold starts to develop. I also see mold in the showers developing very quickly despite my efforts to clean religiously. This was not the case when I lived in San Francisco…. Is there something in the water treatment method that causes increased mold in some areas — some chemical or lack thereof? Is it best to drink bottled spring water? Thank you again!! T"

I’m getting pretty desperate as I have been on a strict candida diet for almost 7 months now and feel as though this is the best I’m going to get on this diet without something else to help eliminate the candida. I have taken various anti fungals without much help. I came accross this today and looks like it was just introduced to the market http://www.energeticnutrition.com/hi/n-fuzed-candida.html Looks like it is completely natural and here’s a brief description of what it does. n-fuzed Candida is a evolutionary new concept for treating the overgrowth of Candida albicans. Using a proprietary blend of Pau d’ Arco, Black Walnut hulls, and vitamin C, the electromagnetic frequencies of Candida albicans are infused into the crystalline structure of water. This signals the immune system to eliminate candida in the blood system, soft tissues, and organs of the body. Since it’s new I cant find any reviews on it and was wondering if you thought it would hurt to try? Although it contains candida essence looks like it’s proven to kill candida."

3,teacupmama,386,Has anyone tried this product yet? I ordered it this am.. I am so desperate right now. My digestion has all but stopped and the inflammation is causing my joints to ache and I cant even get relief from sleep anymore…I have been strict on the diet but even veg juice causes pain bloating gas fatigue now..what next? cancer? I also was researching menopause causes digestion problems so many things are going on I suppose. agh! need relief I have a daughter to raise and a life to live.

Ok ,what about the die-off which, in seven days, would be bad enough to put the normal Candida sufferer in the hospital? If it’s able to do that, doesn’t it make one wonder why it’s basically unheard of? How did you hear about it? Able"
8,princeofsin,386,Honestly these products promise you the moons and stars but most of them don’t do anything. You really don’t need to spend an money on these things which are pretty much useless in my opinion. You have to change your diet primarily.
9,BS7705,386,IT says it kills candida in-vitro in 3 days and completely gone in 7. In-vitro meaning in a lab. So at least they test this in a clinical setting before they release each batch showing it does do that. Who else at least does that?
10,raster,386,"Its a homeopathic product with some antifungals and special water. I am skeptical about this product because you cannot completely kill candida in the body because you need it to survive! If you killed all of the candida in your body, you would die! -raster"
0,Kris8,387," The lower back pain is most likely caused by excess kidney energy as a result of it having to filter so many toxins during candida. The good news is you can release that pain fairly quickly by holding a few acupuncture points. I have fuond energy medicine to be an invaluable tool in healing. Everything is energy and the good thing is that if you know how to move that energy you dont have to feel so much pain! here is a link to innersource.net Donna Edens site (famous for her energy medicine). Hold the sedating points not the strengthening to release the blocked energy. Hold the points labeled 1st at the same time for 3 mins., then hold the points labeled 2nd at the same time for 2 mins. Try doing this throughout the day. I find it helps immediatly. There are points for releasing stuck energy from all your organs meridians. Upper back pain is related to the small intestines, mid back pain is the large intestines. http://www.theinnersourcestore.com/kidney-meridian/ if you have it at your library get this book: Energy medicine, it will change your life kidney meridian[/img] Kris"
0,Ms T,388,"Hello, ladies (and gents) of the Forum. I wanted to pass along my recommendation for a product that has helped me immensely and I think will help others here. I would recommend it to anyone with yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, ammenorhea, or any other number of vaginal/reproductive/candida-related issues. I do not think it is a replacement for the diet, antifungals, and oral probiotics, but it is a terrific adjunct. (Major disclaimer: I have no financial stake in this company. I JUST think this is a truly PHENOMENAL product.) The product is called FloraFemme and it is a vaginal probiotic (suppository form). It was developed by a woman who suffered from chronic yeast infections with no relief, did her own research, and came up with these probiotic strains. Her thinking: if you want something done right, do it yourself, and that while digestive probiotics work, they take a while to make their way to the vagina. Here’s how it helped me. I have suffered from chronic BV, was eating 2 or 3 deserts a day, tons of carbs, etc., and although I never went the prescription drug route, I have tried other vaginal probiotics and homeopathic treatments, including: BV Essentials (two courses – did nothing for me), Gy Na Tren (oral and vaginal probiotic, multiple courses – did nothing for me), Jarrow Femmedophilus (oral priobiotic – nothing), Tea Tree Oil Suppositories (dangerous product – do not use),….. Now, after using FloraFemme, for the first time in a very, VERY long time, my discharge is just about normal and the BV seems to be under control. I did two courses of the product, started seeing results after the first course, and decided to do a second. I may even do a third and continue on a maintenance regime. It is expensive ($50 for a 6-pill course), but was 100% worth it, IMO. I feel like I am getting my life back — including my sex life!!! I purchased FloraFemme on Amazon, but you can also buy direct from the FloraFemme site. The company offers a money-back guarantee. Plus, I called the 800 number with a question, and the owner, Suzanah, called me back. We chatted for an hour, and she is very knowlegdable about Candida. I mean, she totally gets it!! Also, it is worth saying that I experienced a much increased libido (there is definitely a hormonal component to fighting infection), and a lift to my depression. I did also experience a slight increase in vulvar itching for a day, but I knew this part of the healing process and that went away fairly quickly. I am continuing with the diet, but this product is another great way to attack this problem. It’s a great leg-up, not a cure-all. I hope this helps any woman out there who is suffering. And I so glad there is someone like Suzanah, as well as the forum moderators here, helping women when doctors and big pharma are not. All the best in health,  T"

1,raster,389,"You need to heal leaky gut and the diet alone won’t kill all of the candida or cure you. What supplements are you taking? I have been able to introduce fruit in large amounts at about the 1 year point, so you will need more time. I was able to eat a some apples occasionally at the 6-9 month point, but I have been taking a lot of supplements. -raster"
2,Tommo,389,"Hi Raster Thanks for getting back to me, I have been taking caprilic acid but whenever i take one it takes me a week to get over the die off I cannot take molybdendum as I have a really bad allergic reaction so have epsom salt baths to ease the die off milk thistle and dandillion root coffee. I also take garlic oil and probiotics as well. I have the benefit of a hyperbaric chamber which i go to once every two weeks that gives me die off also.. I also take vit c, multivitamins and a high strength omega 3 oil.. I was reading another thread tonight tho and i have still been eating wheat bad advice from another book so have pm’d able900 for the stricter diet am wondering if i have a wheat intolerance as i keep falling asleep after having it.."
3,raster,389,"So it sounds like you have a few problems. One is that you are not protecting the liver enough because you get debilitating die-off. This can be prevented if you take liver support supplements such as molybdenum, milk thistle, and many more products. I’d also consider trying out SF722 which seems to cause less die-off when compared to other antifungals people have mentioned on the forum. You should be long over die-off at the 5 month mark; for me it lasted about 2 weeks; I didn’t take molybdenum either. Are you sweating out the toxins via a steam room, sauna, hot tub, or jacuzzi? This alone will reduce die-off… The second issue is it sounds like you are not eating a strict enough diet and continuing to eat grains such as wheat. Please list your current diet if possible. If you are eating grains still, you basically won’t be making much progress because you need to have a strict diet in order to feed candida as little as possible. You also won’t find a cure if you are not taking any probiotics. Probiotics are the single most important thing you need to get better and this will change the flora of your gut. The diet alone won’t change the flora of your gut…you’ve lost your gut flora and you need to introduce some new flora. Prebiotic foods/supplements will then feed the probiotics allowing the good flora in your gut to thrive. Are you eating any prebiotic foods? Have you seen our forum protocol? Can you afford a naturopathic doctor who can heal you faster than the diet itself? You may want to consult one so that you get healthier faster…it sounds like you haven’t made much progress while on the diet in my opinion. -raster"

What you’ve been doing is revolving in a continuous cycle of destroying the Candida and then feeding them to allow them to multiply and grow in your body again. You will never cure your Candida overgrowth in this manner as it is simply impossible to do so. If it takes you a week to get over the die-off effects of Caprylic acid, then you still have a very strong and large Candida infestation in your body, and you should not be adding any new foods yet. Caprylic acid is a fairly weak antifungal compared to some. Read our protocol (below), and afterwards if you decide to start a diet which will limit food for the Candida in your body, just send a private message to me on the forum.

9,Tommo,389,I also have to take iron suppliments because I am anemic would they be detrimental if candida needs iron?

Iron should be fine because without you probably would feel like crap. You might want to consider eating meat as an alternative but I am no doctor. Your diet is basically a stage 3 diet and you need to do a stage 1 diet. Stage 1/2 would not include things such as rice/soy milk, potatoes, grains, beef, nuts/seeds, oats, and goats milk. Its alright because I basically did stage 3 before stage 1 as well for about 3 months. I could tell it wasn’t working so thats when I came to the forum. Able set me straight and I’ve been here ever since. I’ve been learning on my own so I try to share from my experience and knowledge as well as being on the forum for over a year.

0,CaliCandidaHelp,390,"Ok, so here is my story.. I am 23 y/o male and i believe i had Candida infection for the past 5-6 years or so.. Starting from my teenage years i always had skin problems (acne, rashes, etc..) I went to the multiple doctors who all misled me. I would get an outbreaks on the tip of my penis and mouth corners (soars & wart looking single pimples)The issue would come and go and i was able to ignore it for some time due to lack of symptoms that would come and go. Also, doctors would contradict each other, telling me there is nothing to worry about and some opposite. I did all sorts of STD screening tests and it would always come back clean. Not gonna lie, i been living a very unhealthy lifestyle since i was a kid. (no exercise, etc..) I been smoking cigarettes regularly since i was 12. From the age of 15 to 21 i been experimenting with all sorts of different drugs (i dont anymore) and i been smoking weed for about 8 years. (i just quit that lazy habit few months ago) My immune system is already damaged so that could be another factor of my candida infection. Another cause for my candida was that i was getting sick a lot and had to take many antibiotics.(multiple ear infections, pneumonia, prostatitis – past 4 years i was made believe by my doctors that the rash i had on my genitals was the cause of bacterial prostatitis, which i had and for which I been taking a lot of different antibiotics. I finally cured my prostatitis recently.)Finally, this August i did multiple blood tests and the results showed Candida IgG in my system. In a way i was kind of relived because I finally determined what was wrong with me. Prior to that i thought i had either herpes, genital wards or something scary and permanent. I been at immunologist and i been doing medical injections to improve my immune system prior to Candida treatment. My dermatologist prescribed me with Diflucan (Fluconazole)to treat Candida. I started the treatment and I was prescribed to take 150mg tablet once per week for 10 weeks. I had few extra Diflucan pills and after week 2 not noticing any significant improvements i increase my dosage taking pill every other day for 3rd week and i am planning to switch to once per week once i see the symptoms go away. (i’m finally starting to see improvements. I have some redness rash on a tip of my penis and very itchy rash around my anus.)I figured that increasing dosage wont do any harm after searching this drug on internet and due to the length of my infection and my weight. (185 lb)I also been using oregano oil and tee tree oil to apply to the rash and oregano oil pills as a natural remedies. I just started improving my diet today and switched on steamed vegetables, rice and organic plain yogurt. I know i should be avoiding sugar and junk food. Also i forgot to mention, i am taking adderal (amphetamine pills)to help me study for my licensing exam. My financial situation is very bad right now and my only hope is to get licensed and get a good paying job so i can get out of debt. So i also have a lot of stress on me which i assume is not good in my fight with Candida. Anyways, i asked the pharmacist and he told me that it is ok for me to take Fluconazole & Adderal together; hopefully its correct. I am trying to switch to a healthy lifestyle doing more exercise, eating healthy, etc…  My main questions are: 1. What food is it ok for me to eat while im on this diet? Is rice or cooked eggs are ok? Please let me know if you know of something easy to make? 2. Is it ok for me to drink coffee? (at least a little bit) 3. I recently got a tiny pimple on the tip of my penis, pretty sure i had similar symptom long time ago but im not sure. I am worried that it can be a wart since i have one im treating om my foot. I been putting some 91% rubbing alcohol to dry it up. Do i need to worry about that or do you think its just a candida? Is there anything i can do to make it less noticeable? (its not that noticeable but when i see it i start stressing about it and worrying) 4. Is there any other natural remedies i should consider? or any medication? 5. I know it sounds dumb but when is the soonest i would be able to have an alcoholic beverage without jeopardizing my Candida treatment? ( I really hope i can have few drink this New years Eve)6. Is it safe for me to have sex with condom or without condom when my symptoms go away? 7. Any other good advice you may have? I really appreciate your feedback and your help. Thanks in advance!"

If you’d like to have a copy of it, send a private message to me on the forum.  Is rice or cooked eggs are ok? Please let me know if you know of something easy to make? Reply: Organic eggs should be eaten, but you should avoid all forms of rice as it is pure starch will turn into sugar and feed the Candida once it is in your body. Is it ok for me to drink coffee? (at least a little bit) Reply: No, you should avoid all types of caffeine and drink chicory coffee instead. Be sure that it’s 100% chicory with nothing added to it.  Don’t stop drinking coffee all at one time. You should wean yourself off of it by making it weaker every few days which will probably take several weeks to accomplish. You can start substituting chicory coffee in place of your regular coffee. Bad headaches are a symptom of caffeine withdrawal, so take it slowly.

(its not that noticeable but when i see it i start stressing about it and worrying)  Reply: Pimples that occur anywhere on the body during a Candida infestation are almost always due to the Candida itself. The only way to be certain that you stop the outbreaks is, unfortunately, to treat and cure the infestation. Is there any other natural remedies i should consider? or any medication? Reply: For a complete answer to this question you will need to read our protocol as it covers everything. The Protocol I know it sounds dumb but when is the soonest i would be able to have an alcoholic beverage without jeopardizing my Candida treatment? ( I really hope i can have few drink this New years Eve) Reply: You’ll be better off if you just stop thinking about alcohol, because it takes an awfully long time to rid the body completely of a Candida infestation. Chance are, every time you drink any amount of alcohol, you will set your treatment back substantially; I’ve seen this happen too many times to think otherwise. Is it safe for me to have sex with condom or without condom when my symptoms go away? Reply: Always use a condom during your infestation, that is if you care anything at all about your partner. Any other good advice you may have? Reply: Yes, read and study the protocol and ask me for the strict diet information. Able"

Quote: in addition to the white coating on tongue, does candida also cause your mouth to be really dry? no matter how much water i drink, i am always thirty and thus always have lots of water nearby (i started the candida diet a week ago so water is my best friend). Reply: Water really is your best friend during your infestation and treatment. Not only does it relieve the dryness when you’re drinking it, but it also helps to wash the Candida toxins from your body. Drink as much water as you can as this is part of your treatment. By the way, mouth dryness should actually be expected as part of a Candida overgrowth.  Quote: i guess i have a slightly white coating on my tongue but its not overall noticeable. is there anything that will help this because it is really annoying. i am a teacher and i have to talk all day long so a dry mouth is a big pain to me.

Quote: i was also wondering how to tell when its time to reintroduce foods in the diet? when i start to feel better if i ever do. well its only been a week. Reply: You shouldn’t start reintroducing new, Candida-friendly foods until all of your symptoms have disappeared for, at the very least a period of three months, longer will produce more of a benefit in the long run. Once you have the infestation, it becomes extremely easy for it to return once the symptoms have lessened or disappeared. Quote: when i started the candida diet before (and failed miserably, during the die off i started to notice white spots in my stool. is this dead yeast cells? if so that means its working right? Reply: Yes, that was probably the yeast cells, and yes, it means it was working. But remember that Candida are single-cell organisms which are able to multiply at an alarming rate. The human period from birth to reproductive maturity normally lasts about 25 years, whereas the same Candida period may be anywhere from 8 hours to three days. This means that at least a number of new generations of Candida are being produced in the body every three hours. That’s why we say that the strict diet and antifungals are incapable of destroying ‘all’ of the Candida cells. The only thing capable of doing that is changing the environment of the stomach, intestines, and colon so that the yeast are unable to change into the dangerous pathogen known as Candida albicans. The way this is done is explained in The Protocol on the forum.  Able"

Specifically… my bm’s were not back to normal and I had a hard time with each introduced food. I would get vertigo or a slight dizzy feeling each time I added a new food and I would lose all of my energy and need an immediate nap. While looking for natural anti-fungals and methods of healing, I began to learn about the benefits of essential oils. I had read some amazing testimonies so I decided to give it a try. After extensive research, I was impressed with doTERRA essential oils and decided to give them a try. I had previously been using an oil of oregano and putting it under my tongue, but the comparison of the other brand and doTERRA was stagggering. The doTERRA oregano was significantly more powerful and 100% certified pure therapeutic grade. I have been using the doTERRA oregano among many of their other oils with HUGE success in the past 2 weeks. I can honestly say that this is the best I have felt in my entire life. My energy levels are higher than ever and my digestion is totally normal. It is amazing! I have been able to test foods with no issues whatsoever. If you have any questions about essential oils or doTERRA, please feel free to ask. I wish I had learned about this company YEARS ago. I am so greatful to finally be healing!"

0,Ms T,397," I stumbled across this forum AFTER I started doing a cleanse, so I was not following the protocol as strictly as I could have been. I did get a book on candida (turns out a not-very good book) and did research through other sites, so I eliminated sugar, simple carbs, root vegetables, most dairy, etc. Admittedly, there are days when I have one or two of the “not allowed” foods. About five days ago, I started taking oregano oil, caparyl, coconut oil, and berberine (planning to alternate 2 of these at a time every four days) and within a day experienced SEVERE die-off. My muscles were so achy I couldn’t sleep, so I assumed that I started too strong, with the Oregano in particular. I backed down on the oregano a bit and alternated to the berberine and coconut oil. Am also taking Molybdenum and milk thistle. My muscle soreness went away but the symptoms morphed into flu-like symptoms, and now I am feeling it in my lungs and coughing up dark yellow phlegm. I also noticed a black spot on my toe nail, which I assume was the candida looking for a new home…because it wasn’t there until two days ago…what the heck? I did one colon hydrotherapy session on Friday. Last night, I took one of Dr. Ohira’s probiotics for the first time. Then today…please excuse the graphic detail…I pooped some kind of a dark orangish corn-kernel looking thing. Of course, I immediately searched on the Internet and found some people think these are parasites, others seem to link pooping this bean thing with a medication they are on. What I am REALLY worried about is that the candida and/or parasites are infecting my lungs because they can no longer live in the digestive tract????? Do parasites/candida move when they are disturbed? Or since I am ingesting antifungals will my blood prevent safe/hospitable transport for them altogether? Is it more likely that whatever is in my lungs (whether candida or parasites) was there before and is now making its presence known in reaction to the antifungals? For background, I did have pneumonia once 20 years ago and was treated with antibiotics. I have not had excessive amounts of antibiotics otherwise but have had some, was led to try a cleanse because I was eating 2 to 3 desserts a day (and I am a little person), craving potatoes and starches, had chronic BV, and also had taken prescription iron due to anemia and uterine fibroids. But otherwise I am really healthy — LOL. Thanks for any insight and all the great info on this site!!"
1,raster,397,"Wow, this is pretty gnarly sounding. Have you travelled to other countries much? The thing is everyone has candida and parasites but at different levels. Symptoms of parasite overgrowth are very similar to candida from my experience and the toxins released by parasites can be just as bad. Also, google image search “parasites in stool” to see if you have it. They may have found a good host. If you have the money, I would get some kind of parasitic stool test from genova diagnostics and determine what you have got. You may have quite a challenge ahead of you and it might be best to determine what you have now. Parasites can move throughout the body and if they congregate within a certain organ you can get very ill. I shared a link on the forum about a woman who had a parasite in her brain and had to have brain surgery. I don’t want to freak you out but thats about the worst it can get. Another possibility is you had hemorrhoids or other types of fecal matter in your gut that was released by doing the cleanse. You definitely did over do it with the antifungals because you should start out slowly with a few drops per day. The more you use the more die-off you will get. Also the more you use the more volatile your bm’s will become. I’d protect the liver as much as possible and continue to kill off the bugs in your gut. I personally wouldn’t use berberine because its basically an antibiotic which kills both the beneficial and bad bacteria in the gut. You may also want to lay off the probiotics until the die-off is less severe because they are just getting flushed out the body at this point. Your symptoms sound like typical die-off symptoms btw. -raster"
2,Ms T,397,"Thank you for the reply and apologies for the delay in getting back to you. Although I am still coughing up dark phlegm, my cough is not as severe or as persistent. And, while I am not sure, I think the recent toe nail fungus that appeared is dying off. All in all, I am feeling MUCH better. I’ve tapered back on the dosages for oregano oil and other antifungals, though I am still taking them, and feel I am still making progress although I have gotten some cravings for coffee and other foods I don’t normally eat. I do worry about killing off some candida but not restoring fully to balance of good and bad bacteria. I also worry about a recurrence. I agree that I should get my stool checked for both candida and parasites, but I think it makes sense to wait until after I am done with the cleanse. Thank you again."

0,mahdama,402,"Hi guys, I am on day 13 of the diet. Generally i feel miles better. However i have been experiencing pretty bad constipation (no bowel movement), despite feeling that i need the toilet the last 2 days. I am not sure what to take. I was considering senna leaf tea as a laxative (i do take psyllium husk, vitamin c and bentonite soltuion everyday, and a lot of vegetables with olive oil in my diet- so i feel i am doing a pretty good job already) Advice would be great. Thank you."
1,Jo*Jo,402,"I had this problem after about day 3 of the cleanse and right from the start of the cleanse I was taking 2 tbsp’s of olive oil followed by very warm water after each meal. That didnt do very much so I added an epsom salts drink once a day and that did a bit but again not very much. After about 7 days I used a natural laxative and that helped loads but obviously it didnt last. Next i started taking Slippery Elm – 2 tablets 3 times a day without the oil, warm water and epsom salts and things were better but not great. Now I use the slippery elm with the oil and warm water and I’m pretty regular now.. not ideal but the best i’m gonna get with no carbs. But thats just me.

3,raster,402,"This is exactly why we don’t recommend using psyllium because it can cause constipation for days. It also can cause internal bleeding. If you want to improve your movements immediately, I would stop with the psyllium husks and switch to something like chia seeds. Psyllium is only meant to be taken during the cleanse, and you shouldn’t continue it any longer than this during this time period. -raster"
4,misscandida,402,Hi Raster would the Chia seeds help causing bowel movements? I’m having the same problems 🙁
5,Pattinoo,402,Yeah. I had problem with this for about 4 weeks or so. Not fun. I used colon Clenz and acacia fiber and still needed suppositories and enemas a couple of times. Just when I was about to add Aloe Vera juice it got better.
6,West11,402,I once used a bad probiotic that cause this once. Drinking peppermint tea and like someone said before take some magnesium should help. If it gets really bad a sea salt water flush my help.
7,GandhaLajja,402,"I occasionaly have this problem too and what really works wonders, at least for me, is to drink warm salted water, just a cup, first thing in the morning. Sometimes you need to drink it repeatedly throughout the day, but you don´t need to increase the amount of salt, just a bit is enough."

0,Dfase,404,"First, a little background on my story: I’m a male, 30 yrs old, been having issues for about 2 years. Started with frequent diarrhea, gas, mood swings, fuzzy head, constant hunger, craving carbs. I’ve been systematically eliminating carbs for the past year and was down to a diet of just meat, veggies (no starch), eggs, and nutritional shake (Reliv). I’d say i’m about 80-90% better, but still have issues. The symptoms i still have most frequently are gas, fuzzy head and mood swings. The fuzzy head usually gets worse the further I get from my last meal and I feel better after eating (blood sugar always measures in the normal range). Each of the docs i’ve been to in the past just said I had a “carb inteolerance” and needed to keep doing what i was doing and testing the diet. The last doc I saw suggested Yeast and i started doing research. It makes sense, especially considering my mom has the exact same issues which came on in the same manner, age, etc. Doc put me on Probiotics, Digestive Enzymes, Microb GI X and Diflucan. Haven’t noticed a huge difference either way since starting this combo. I have not had any tests done yet, he said when i go back next month he will probably do a stool sample. Also have periods (or days) where i have tons of energy, almost too much, like excess adrenaline. Assuming this is because of some sort of adrenal imbalance or problem. My questions: 1) Do most of you have reactions fairly soon after eating a food you shouldn’t? It normally takes 1-2 days after I eat something to feel bad. In the past I even felt better right after eating a carb. This makes it really hard to pinpoint which foods are triggers because I have to try and figure out what it was I ate over the past two days. 2) Is it common for the “fuzzy head” and hunger to be the most lingering symptoms? it seems i’ve been able to get the diarrhea under control, even the gas to some extent, but having the most trouble just feeling normal in the head. 3) Anyone else have experience with this being a hereditary condition? Any other advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"
0,Candid N,405,"I just heard back from my doctor who said that there are NO signs of yeast in my gut. I am very excited and I attribute getting over the hump to Formula SF722. My candida symptoms were evident since 1985 after antibiotics and came back with a vengeance April after more antibiotics (severe raw skin and terrible yeast). It took me quite a while to stop having die off reactions until I introduced Formula SF722 by Thorne close to 6 months into the strict diet. Last month (intuitively on the exact 6 month mark of the strict diet) I felt confident enough to finally reintroduce foods–after less than a week on SF722. I no longer have the annoying dry/pealing skin rashes and itching, nor do I get exhausted from die off (used to happen after eating coconut butter). I highly recommend SF722. It’s ingredients are really good for those with allergies (except to fish, olive oil, or vegetable glycerine)–Ingredients listed, below. Thorne is a great line of products that are made with exceptional ingredients. I wish you luck in curing your candida. Stick with it, and keep track of what gives you reactions.

I hope to feel even better since I’m feeling about how I was before April (when I had the antiboitics)–good to hear. I was wondering, last night, what the absence of yeast in my gut meant as far as recovery, and whether it means I no longer have candida overgrowth, or if it may still be in other parts of my body. Also, is there anything you would you advise besides staying on the same protocol, and slowly testing foods? (I have Hashimoto’s Hypothyroidism and sometimes Adrenal fatigue–mostly when I’m stressed by big life decisions)."
3,raster,405,"You can never fully kill candida so its going to stick around. What I suggest at this point is to start healing holistically if possible. Find a naturopath who will heal the other organs such as galbladder, thyroid, adrenals, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, spleen, etc. based on your symptoms. For me, healing the liver and kidneys has been the most important thing to do to get over the damage caused by candida. Also, many people with candida have parasites, so consider trying out black walnut extract with SF722 for a bit. So basically you should do some “cleanup” on the organs that were damaged by candida and your previous lifestyle. Acupuncture is a cornerstone of my treatment and it can do wonders. It’ll help you detox toxins, heal specific organs, and rebalance the body. I think it works more effectively than supplements by itself.

0,Shannon29,406,"I just have to say that my best friend in this whole candida nightmare is Bragg apple cider vinegar. It’s cheap and it works wonders for digestion. I used to not be able to digest anything but cooked green beans and squash without complications. Started 1 teaspoon of ACV in some water before each meal and now I can digest beef! No more bloating, heartburn or cramps. I tried a ton of (some very expensive) digestive enzymes and nothing worked as well as good ol’ ACV. It’s also fantastic for making bone broth for healing the leaky gut. I add 1 or 2 tablespoons (depending on the size of the pot) and it pulls twice as many minerals from the bones than slow cooking alone. and the best part…ACV enemas! I was a little skeptical at first, but after I started them and saw tons of candida (and a few alien creatures that I believe to be were parasites) come out I was thrilled. I had rarely ever seen it in my stool before doing these. I add only 2 tbsp to the standard enema bag with warm water. Any more will irritate the colon. I do them 2 days on and 5 days off, following each one with a hefty probiotic implant. They have worked wonders for me. Hooray for ACV! Everyone battling candida should definitely make it a staple in their protocol 🙂"

It is has been 7+ months since I’ve had anything close to diarrhea…as I have been constipated off and on and struggle with hard stools. My diet has not changed and the only thing I can attribute the diarrhea to is changing probiotics a couple days ago. Is cramping and diarrhea a good or bad thing when starting a new (stronger) probiotic? Should I lessen my dosage (1 instead of 2 capsules daily) to see if the diarrhea subsides? Please advise. Thanks!

2,Able900,408,"Probiotics can definitely cause diarrhea, and diarrhea is certainly better than being constipated when the die-off toxins are in your body, but you don’t want it to go on indefinitely of course.

Definitely back off to once a day and increase the amount to two times a day after 4 or 5 days; at that time you should test two a day once again. Able"

1,raster,409,Are you taking collodium silver? We haven’t recommend this on the forum before so whatever you doing is at your own risk of course. You likely won’t be able to defeat candida quickly; it can take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth. We have a forum protocol that gives you a good timeline and plan to follow if you want to check it out. -raster

There’s a woman who has a page specifically about colloidal silver: http://www.rosemaryjacobs.com/ She’s also quoted in this article about it. Wikipedia’s page on Medical uses of silver might be informative too.Rosemary Jacobs wrote: Silver drugs were used by medical doctors before the advent of antibiotics. Although they didn’t work, they permanently turned many people blue and gray. The condition is called argyria. It was formerly common, and is well documented and understood by scientists. If NDs had known as much about medicine as I, an educated consumer, do, they would have searched the medical literature before including anything in their formulary. If they had done that, they would have seen that: there are no studies showing that ingesting silver in any form or amount offers benefits; colloidal silver does not treat eye infections; taking silver internally or putting it in your eye can result in permanent discoloration. Many things have been shown to kill microbes in vitro, but it doesn’t mean they’re safe/effective when ingested, and there’s no evidence supporting the use of colloidal silver. There is a decent amount showing that’s it’s incredibly harmful though, and you can see some case studies here, here and here.The ingestion of colloidal silver appears to be an increasing practice among patients using alternative health practices. All silver-containing products including colloidal silver should be labeled with a clear warning to prevent argyria, especially in alternative health practices."

Are you going to Texaco with the sniffles, or are you going to critically analyse the evidence first? Your homoeopath has no education that allows him/her to diagnose you with any health problem. I advise you to be extremely cautious when following their advice. These fields are very poorly regulated. They have no understanding of the biological sciences, let alone the complex interactions between the body and poorly understood pathogenic microbes. Just because MDs haven’t helped you, it doesn’t mean unqualified charlatans who sell liquids with no active ingredient at extortionist rates of profit have the answers. This is false dichotomy. I advise you to learn what you can on this forum, and to never stop being critical. You don’t need to throw money at hacks claiming to have cure-alls and silver bullets. The sooner people stop supporting homoeopathy, the sooner it’ll do anyone interested in better health a favour and die."

8,Javizy,409,I understand how you feel. That’s what makes homoeopaths so deplorable. They’re profiting handsomely from your suffering without providing any reliable help.

9,420biker,409,"colliodal silver is one of the easiest things to make, and they charge huge money for it. Im not sure of the health effects…. i have seen advertising that it is good for inflammation and has antibacterial properties.. but as for the long term health effects, who knows what it does for adverse effects. but lets look at the facts… metals are not something that is really associated with good health, it is seen as a toxin. You would think it would have the opposite effect than antioxidants would. Your cells are constantly moving, antioxidants lubricate them so they can contact each other more easily. It also protects them from cellular damage. Free radicals such as dirt, toxins and metals just create more friction, and in turn cause more damage to the cells. the cells are constantly reproducing cells, if they didnt than we would die. But if the cells become abnormal from free radicals, then they reproduce abnormal cells. This is what causes bad health and cancer. In order to treat fungal infections you need very strong ppms so there is even greater risk. Is it really worth the risk? I know how to cure cancer but it isnt cheap, it costs between $2000-4000 to make enough hemp oil to cure serious cancers.. and thats if you know where to find good weed. What i recommend is that you eat as much antioxidants as you can… look up antioxidant foods on google. Then find the ones that you are allowed to eat on stage 1 of the diet, this will protect your prostate. Some foods off the top of my head are garlic, ginger, broccoli… theres maybe more though, look it up. I thought it was going to take me years to get my candida better… i had it so bad that you couldnt tell my tongue was pink at all.. even right after brushing the hel out of my mouth. I had athletes foot deep in my nails, ringworm all over my body. just by follwing the protocol for this website, i got rid of 95% of the candida… then i finished it off with a fruit cleanse. My immune system is very bad because i have stage 3 adrenal exaustion… which is where you body stores vitamin C… but the diet is really all you need though trust me. I am now cured even though i messed up the diet quite a few times."

0,francescamarie717,412,My mothers birthday is coming up next week. Usually I would make her a birthday cake but since we are both trying the candida diet I was wondering if anyone had any good ideas or receipts they could share on what I could make her for her birthday? She suggested Angel Food cake but I’m not sure thats the best substitute either. Thank you for any advice 🙂
1,Javizy,412,"You could try something with coconut flour, oat bran etc. I think there are a few recipes on here. You could look around low-carb forums for other ideas. This guy has a phobia of carbs and sugar, but I saw this crazy recipe the other day http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.co.uk/2008/03/last-weekend-we-happened-on-farmers.html (note: probably not suitable…)."
2,mamagibbs4,412,"I like to open my cookbook, choose a recipe, and substute in acceptable ingredients. EXAMPLE: all-purpose flour (use coconut flour, or maybe millet flour), sugar (use zylitol or stevia), vegetable oil (use olive oil or coconut oil, or another cold-pressed type of oil listed in the approved foods), shortening (use organic butter, ghee, or coconut oil if it doesn’t need to be a solid fat), carrots (use zuchini), etc. I haven’t found a good substitute for fruit, however. 🙁 Good luck! And post if you find a really yummy one!"
3,soon,412,Just buy some coconut ice cream from the store. The SO brand makes a vanilla flavored pint with xylitol as a sweetener. It takes exactly -exactly- like regular vanilla ice cream. This is even making me want to go buy some right now. I used to looovveee ice cream.
4,Magical1,412,"I tried that coconut ice cream before I started the diet and I had bad problems from the sugar alcohol. It’s good though if you can handle it.

0,balabol,413,"Hi guys. This site is awesome and thank you for all the helpful info. Really desperate and hope someone can give me advice. I would be SO grateful! Long story short: i’ve had candida for 5 years and just learned a few months ago what my problem was and been battling it for at least 5 months now. All the diet and ‘natural’ antifungals did not help to fight it off completely and i kind of relapsed. I have esophogeal candidisis. I don’t think it’s horrible but I know it’s there and endoscopy showed it (i would say it’s not severe at all but on the scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the worst, i’d say my situation is at a 6.) Basically I discovered diflucan but most doctors I went to here in America absolutely sucked and did not help me, and thought I was fine or thought it was something else. Long story short, I diagnosed myself after reading stuff online for hundreds of hours and I was FINALLY able to get my hands on diflucan. However, I only have 12 150mg pills of it. I read that for esophogeal candidisis one can take 200 on the first day and take 100 mg every day for 14-21 days. Now today I took the first 150mg pill. I have 11 more 150mg pills. That’s 1650 mgs left. How should I use the rest? Should I take 150mg a day for 11 more days? Should I take 150mg every other day as I read that it stays in the system for several days? Or should I split it and take around 100mg for 16 days? I really want to get rid of this thing, it’s been ruining my life. I also have about 25 days’ worth of CandiGone left which I’m planning on jumping on immediately after my Diflucan course. Sorry this is so long but I hope you were patient enough to have understood the issue and can help me decide. I can’t stress it enough how greatful I would be for any tips! Thanks so much!! B"
0,DivideZero,414,"Hello, I’m new to this forum and I’ve decided to follow this diet as I have recurring jock itch, bloated stomach and my eczema is getting worse and worse. I am on my third day of the cleanse and I’m literally following the guidance on the website: 8:00am …. Detox drink  10:00am .. Broth soup  1:00pm …. Detox drink 3:00pm …. Broth soup 5:00pm …. Detox drink 7:00pm …. Liver flush drink I’ve read Able’s guide as well which is also quite similar. But I just wanted some clarification on this cleanse if possible. For best effectiveness should I just stick to this liquid diet? I’m feeling awfully hungry and really tempted to eat something. I don’t seem to be experiencing any die-off symptoms? Just a slight headache or light-headed feeling. But other than that I feel ok. Could someone advise if I’m doing something right or wrong? Thanks very much!"
1,420biker,414,"Right now you are doing a fast lol which is a good thing… but yes you are allowed to eat, eat lightly steamed veggies, or raw if you chew it really well.. califlower, broccoli, celery, asparagus, green beans, cabbage, brussel sprouts, cucumber, advocados, lettuce are good choices to eat. Almonds, sunflower seed and pumpkin seeds you can eat for protein. You are supposed to stick to veggies for the 14 day cleanse, then you can introduce some meats if it goes well. They dont mention this on the website, but i have found strawberries to be one of the best weapons against candida… make sure you eat it on an empty stomach… like now is a good time that you havent eaten for a while. The lactic acid will break down fungus and toxins and shoot them out of your body. I find i get good results from 5-10 fresh strawberries. Make sure you eat it in small bites so your saliva can break it down. Also, the vitamin C will power up your liver. Strawberries give me killer die off too, and the good thing is the fungus doesnt become immune to it like it does with antifungals. The more die off you have the more fungus is dying off which is a good thing. Whatever you do, dont eat fruit unless you are sure your stomach is empty, fruits digest much faster than other foods and it will get stuck in your stomach and make your candida worse if your stomach is busy digesting something already."
2,DivideZero,414,Thank you for the reply. I think I spoke too soon… I’m going through some die-off symptoms now actually. I’ll try eating some strawberries when I wake up tomorrow!
3,raster,414,"Be very careful with berries because they mold very quickly. If you have bad leaky gut, you will be allergic to all fruit including most berries. I like blueberries more because they do not mold as quickly; strawberries only last a few days tops. I also would not have any berries while on the cleanse; its meant for later in your treatment after your gut heals. Divide…you are doing a fast and not a cleanse. During a cleanse you should eat foods; we recommend eating only non-starchy vegetables. -raster"

Strawberries contain fructose, glucose and sucrose, all sugars in case you’re not aware. So you’re basically keeping the Candida thriving with a few hefty meals a day. Way to go.  Several people on the forum have eaten strawberries or other berries only to cause their mouth thrush to grow worse, others, including myself, tried them and experienced stronger Candida symptoms, but never has anyone mentioned die-off from eating strawberries. How long have you had your infestation? Able"
6,DivideZero,414,"Brilliant, so I just messed up my cleanse? I believe my jock itch started 12 months ago. This was then followed by eczema and it’s been getting worse ever since. It’s all over my arms, neck and legs."
7,420biker,414,"I have had candida for about 2 years, been treating i with this website for about 6 months. Right now strawberries are the only thing im doing to keep my candida in check… when i stop eating them my candida comes back. But i guess the lactic acid in the strawberries must affect leaky gut then. If you have a bad flare up, take a fresh strawberry, let it dissolve in your mouth then brush your teeth. the fungus will basically fall apart and come off your tongue like its nothing… it has the same effect when you eat the strawberry. But my bad, i guess strawberries are for after leaky guy is healed… sorry bout that divide, it might be too early to use this tool yet"
8,DivideZero,414,"No worries, I ate the strawberries but I don’t think anything has happened except that today I’m going through a temperature. I think my die off symptoms are really kicking in."
9,DivideZero,414,"Hello, Having done more research about candida albicans I am starting to doubt that I have a candida overgrowth. To test myself I had taken 2 tablets of Candida Clear and 2 teaspoons of virgin organic coconut oil last night. Today, I’m not suffering from any die-off symptoms? My eczema just comes and goes even with me being on the diet. Could be it related to something else? My family has a history of suffering from eczema and asthma."
0,Miriam,415,"Hello, I did well for about 2 months following the protocol.I have gone off the protocol for about 6 weeks. Eating what ever I wanted. How do I get back on tract. Thanks, Miriam"
1,420biker,415,"Hey it happens… your best bet is to start over, you want to cleanse your body first by sticking to stage 1 foods… only veggies for 14 days. Make the soup broth everyday. Make sure you take the husk fibre and bertonite clay, and your liver flush every night. After you get used to the routine it will just be part of your day. I have messed up many times in treating my candida… they were only minor setbacks, but in order to get better you have to get used to the routine and stick to it for a few months to really make progress in healing your gut. I notice that once i mess up once it would discourage be and i would be tempted to give up on the program all together but even if you do it is much better to stick to it.. remember it is only a minor setback and it is still much better to stick to the program even though you had a setback so you dont lose what progress you worked so hard for. buy some stevia for when you have sweet cravings… what i do now when im craving sugar is make a bowl of oatmeal, put lots of cinnimon in it and some sugar free almond milk, with 2 packs of stevia… almost tastes like a dessert and takes care of your sweet tooth."
2,Miriam,415,Thanks for responding. I had a difficult time with the liver flush ingredients. They made me sick to my stomach. Is there another flush I can try? Thanks Miriam Should I start with 3 days of the Molybdum then start the detox cleanse. Then which do I go with first the probiotics or the antifungal. I do have Coconut milk keifer daily. Should I stop it for now? Thanks Miriam
3,DivideZero,415,It seems like probiotic first then anti fungal. If you’re doing the cleanse maybe remove kefir out for now.
4,paulkur89234,415,I don’t think it’s advisable to have coconut milk for now. You just have go first with the antifungal and then probiotics.

I did not do the cleanse so I’m not going to try to give you advice. I know that if you search the forum you will find 100’s of places where your advised to NOT do the “Husk fibre” because it causes some type of internal bleading. I have also read to not use the clay. I would search the site again or ask Able900 or raster. I’m sorry your going back to square one. Good luck."
6,420biker,415,"Well theres 2 ways you can do this… you can either starve off the candida, or try to kill it with antifungals… the way you use antifungals is you switch to a different antifungal every 7 days… this way the fungus doesnt have a chance to build a tolerance to them. You need to use several antifungals at once. Personally i didnt find killing the fungus this way to be very effective for the money you put into it, so i ended up switching to the other method… starving the fungus off. the more you starve off the fungus the easier itll be to finish off with the antifungals. Usually you wouldnt start probiotics until later in the treatment. 6 months ago i had candida so bad you couldnt see any pink on my tongue at all.. now you cant see any white on my tongue at all.. i messed up many times in the diet as well, but everytime i messed up i just went back to the program the next day and tried to stick to it. The candida plays tricks with your mind.. it makes you think you need sugar, but when you get cravings you just gotta remember.. this is not going to help me get any better and it isnt going to make me feel any better.. and have some stevia sweetened oatmeal or something. One thing that helped heal my gut was aloe vera juice… try taking some a bit before you take the liver detox… if that doesnt work then drink the aloe vera juice everyday until you are able to tolerate the liver flush. I bought 1 bottle of it and it seemed to help my stomach big time, and it also helped my candida a bit as well.. but not as well as antifungals or anything. I find that your liver does the majority of the work in fighting candida. Other ways you can help your liver are by eating lemons/ limes, or by juicing them and drinking them right away… especially after meals… it aids digestion, supports your liver and helps reduce food allergies after meals (if you have any). Yeah i agree the husk does make the stomach bleed.. might be better off waiting until your gut heals some more first.. i noticed it definately makes a big difference in fighting the candida though, especially if you have bad constipation… or you always could use colonic irrigation with coffee.. it cleans you right out."
7,Miriam,415,"Hi, I have heard of coffee enemas. Can the coffee enema be done or does it have to be a colonic. Colonics are about $125.00 each time in my area. Miriam"
8,flailingWcandi,415,"You might consider trying Dvjorge’s or Chris24’s enemas protocols over coffee or colonics – Look up their posts – both have had remarkably quick success in treating their chronic CRC. Husks tend to clear out the good bacteria as well, thus why they aren’t suggested."
9,Miriam,415,"Hi, I starting thr detox/broth this morning. Looking for good results. Looking forward to loosing some weight and feeling better.Ii plan to drink plenty of water and lemon water. i’m gonna try to stay off food and just stay on the liquids. It’ s nice to know that there are foods we can eat at this stage. Gonna continue with the oil pulling and may have a sauna every 3 days. Miriam"
10,420biker,415,"Colonic irrigation is actually pretty easy to do yourself.. all you need is a hose about 1/4″ thick… big enough to pour coffee into, about 3ft long. Put it in yourself deep enough that coffee flows easily into you, if it does not go in easily it isnt in far enough. You want to use fairly warm coffee, not hot.. pour about 2 cups in and blow it thru the hose… remove the hose and wait until you have to go to the bathroom… probably wont be longer than 30 secs. Personally i wouldnt get it done by someone else, that is just weird lol"
11,420biker,415,"Make sure you eat veggies… it will help you get better faster.. veggies act like a sponge and soak up the fungus. cauliflower and broccoli are good choices.. theres many others on the food list for stage 1. Fasting is beneficial, but not until later on… i noticed that although it seems to help the candida for the time you are fasting… it never really cleans you out unless you detox with fruit acids but you gotta heal your gut first. yeah that totally makes sense about the husk… not the best thing for you if it pulls your good bacteria as well… might as well take antibiotics while your at it, just kidding lol"
0,flipperflop,416,I have been prescribed Saccharomyces boulardii by my family doctor which is apparently effective in treating Canadia. It can be bought over the counter at the pharmacy. Florastor- Saccharomyces boulardii is the name of the prodcut. I am trying a thirty day course. But apprarently doctors give them to patients who have recently took courses of antibiotics. thought I would let you all know since it is not in this forum at all.

0,RebeccaB,417,I started the cleanse based on what was on the website two days ago. Now I am worried that I should not be doing it this way. I was just glancing through the various discussions when I stumbled across “the protocol”. Which is WAY different then what is on the website. Should I stop following the detox cleanse as described on the website? Shouldn’t there be something on the website that warns people that there is a different “protocol” described elsewhere and how to get to it?
1,flailingWcandi,417,"Hey, Rebecca Yes, it can be confusing; which is natural. There’s a steep learning curve as it’s a complicated complex to treat. Don’t worry, the forum goes much further than anything I’ve found online; even the web site. There are reasons for that, I’m sure. That’s why we are all here; to read/learn/share/guide. I’m NO EXPERT, only a fellow sufferer whose trying to wrap their minds around this all myself. My best suggestion is to familiarize yourself with all the various components of the protocol. You might want to print out the various pages found here, as there is a lot of cross referencing. PM Able for the alternative strict diet this forum mainly uses which is also different than found on the web site. The experts will know your answer on how to proceed. I don’t think it’s much of a big deal, just continue forward. Rarely, have I seen anyone not get cornered somewhere along their journey and learn from it – then share those mistakes with others. I bumped the SHARING OUR MISTAKES thread as well, which may be of some interest. Good luck and many blessings on your healing journey."
2,soon,417,There are as many protocols as there are naturopaths but this site I think is an excellent place to start. People have cured their candida using many different methods.
3,420biker,417,"Trust me, you dont want to go anywhere else… stick to the program on this site. My candida was so bad 6 months ago i thought i was going to die and never get better.. but now i am completely healed. Go on the 14 day cleanse (stage 1 foods), make the soup broth everyday, and drink it 3x a day… it has all the vitamin and minerals your body needs that the candida is stealing from you. Take the liver detox drink on an empty stomach before you go to bed. For protein eat almonds, pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds during the cleanse.. but make sure you chew it extremely well or it can be hard on the stomach, and right now you want to heal it. After that stick to the stage 2 foods, which is when you can start eating certain meats. After you stay on this diet for a few months you will notice a huge difference and it wont be long before you can finish it off with antifungals. The hardest part is staying away from simple carbs and sugar.. you just gotta remember it isnt going to make you feel any better. Exercise stimulates a hormone that stops sugar cravings so try going for walks and whatnot."

Lying in bed brings many questions to mind and I appreciate this forum where we can get saliant, straightforward answers. Hi mate, how do you know you have candida? You might but you might not. Diarrhoea and brain fog are too typical signs for bacterial overgrowth. Only the unbalance of new bacteria in your guts after a antibiotic cure is enough to that you have these symptoms you are talking about. Check on the net about SIBO and you will see that it has the same sympthoms. The only way to find out is that you experiment. I did this after feeling worse and worse in the diet. I then found out that eating low fibre stopped my diarrhoea in only 3 days. After the diarrhoea stopped my malnutrition stopped and many many aliments I thought would have been die-off stopped too. Today I feel 60 to 80 percent better and better. If you only have wind, stomach pain and diarrhoea I would not assume straight away you have candida. You too can suffer from IBS. Why not to assume that too. It has the same symptoms too. The trouble is that if you assume that you have candida and go on the strict diet with high fibre and low carbs you cant get better if you have IBS or SIBO. If you want to continue fighting candida that is your choice but set yourself a time and say to yourself. If I feel worse and worse with the symptoms and if the die-off doesnt stop after 8 weeks I am trying the SIBO diet for a test for two weeks and if that doesnt work I try the IBS diet for 3 weeks.  Or get a check up from the Lap checking on Candida. Dont fight a ghost and wonder if you dont get better. all the best to you  Thomas"

It seems to me once one gets their yeast/bacteria/ph in balance you are well again yet I read so many times how people have been struggling with this for years? Because the infestation is much more difficult to cure than most people realize, and there are specific ways to destroy the Candida cells. For example, antifungals will destroy some of the Candida, but until you change the environment of the intestines, you will not cure the infestation completely and they will continue to reestablish their strong hold on the body until the environment is no longer beneficial for their growth. The truth is, it takes a long time to get the yeast/bacteria/ph in balance. Read the post below for more information. The Protocol Able"
4,Latka,425,"why it takes so long to get over this? or why some people suffer for years with this? This is just a hunch but something I at least need to consider: It seems to me that there is some greater imbalance or life style factor always at the root of getting Candida. Sure taking antibiotics will destroy the natural flora in the gut, but I still believe that there were other factors contributing to the weakening of the immune system that made the overgrowth possible. For me it was the accumulative stress from finishing my masters, having jaw infection and being on antibiotics, having a part time job I hated, running a project that was draining me, being constantly on the run and skipping meals etc. And that is probably why some people aren’t getting better no matter what. Because there is something that they haven’t changed about their life, or their stress responses, or their ways of relating to themselves. There is an imbalance that makes the perfect environment for illnesses and things like candida overgrowth to thrive in. I can keep taking all these supplements, antifungals etc. but if I dont change my life so that it is less stressful and more balanced, it’s like just putting a band aid on that offers a temporary relief. Even if I do get better but then go straight back into my dysfucntional habits and life style, it will only keep coming back. As much as it sucks to have this, I have realised that this is a life lesson for me to learn to take better care of myself."

I will ask about vitamin C because she advised me to stop taking it when I first saw her 1.5 months ago. She uses “applied kinesiology” to check how my body reacts to different supplements and products – it’s a way for her to know which supplements/products are effective for my particular body. The vitamin C didn’t test so well for me. However, you make a very valid point about missing out on a major source of vitamin C in fruits (although I am slowly reintroducing berries/apples back into my diet – 1 small portion daily). Also – wondering what you think about an ammonia-like smell I have in my nose. The naturopath has linked it to my body being too acidic. She has me taking a tsp of baking soda in water before bed to try to balance my pH and eliminate the odor in my nose. It doesn’t seem to be helping much. I see her again next week and will follow up but wondering if you or anyone else has any other recommendations for this issue? Thanks again. This forum is very helpful."

I was diagnosed with systemic candida about 2 months ago after suffering for almost 10yrs. The doctor put me on Diflucan, but after 2 weeks of taking it I was taken off of it because it made my platelet count drop. I was taken off everything to give my system a chance to recover the platelet count. Once it was normal again I was switched to Nystatin. I don’t know if anyone on here has taking Nystatin but I really don’t know if it is working or not, all the articles I read on line talk about the horrible die-off it has, I have been taking it for 2 weeks with no die-off at all. How do I know if it is actually working? Another issue is the sugar in it, the bottle is 50% sugar!!! Why is there sugar in an anti-fungal when the sugar feeds it? I have been on a sugar-free candida diet for about 2 months, and the only thing that I have noticed is that my food allergies/sensitivities are all coming back!!!

So I made some (serious?) mistakes: 1. Didn’t do a cleanse or detox before starting the diet. 2. Started natural antifungals (SF722 and garlic) at the same time as the diet. 3. Started probiotics at the same time as the diet (and antifungals) 4. Started the molybdenum after three days on diet/antifungals/probiotics. So my question is how to proceed from here? Since I now realize that I did everything all at once instead of following the proper sequence of steps from the protocol, should I just continue the diet, antifungals, and probiotics or do I need to start over from square one and begin with the cleanse and then proceed in the correct order?

2,raster,429,"Hello michmess, This is actually the way I started things off…with a big kabbam. I did antifungals, probiotics, and the strict diet all at once (actually it wasn’t very strict). Basically, I look at this as the “do it hard” approach where you’ll surely feel the most ill as quickly as possible. The goal of the protocol is to avoid excessive die-off, unknown allergies, and a more gradual transition into getting healthy. If you want to do it fast, go for it…but we don’t recommend it. You could have more complications, more die-off, and feel more lousy than we intended. The cleanse is completely optional. Its up to you whether or not to take diflucan. I have never taken it and don’t want to personally…it can damage your liver which you need for other reasons. I am completely against western medicine even though I do take a sleeping medication due to my chronic insomnia. The way you proceed from here is to get more vitamins, supplements, etc. and find other ways to relieve the symptoms if they exist. A long term goal for anyone with a candida problem is to heal their various organs and only a naturopathic doctor can do this effectively. You should be mostly healed via the diet and protocol but certain things like liver damage could still exist. You should also do all you can to heal your allergies and leaky gut. The goal of the diet is to reduce the inflammation. Email able900 for a strict forum foods list. -raster"
3,michmess,429,"Raster: Thanks for the response. I guess I have a tendency to try to do things as quickly and thoroughly as possible, which isn’t always the best approach with Candida. I also suffer with adrenal fatigue, hypothyroidism, generalized anxiety disorder, and low DHEA, estradiol, estriol, and progesterone hormones (menopause), IBS, leaky gut, and allergies to dairy, eggs, corn, oats, tea, black pepper, etc. So I felt like “crap” before I even started the Candida diet. I tend to try to do things “perfectly” – which contributes to the anxiety (which stresses the adrenals, which impacts the immune system, which leads to leaky gut, allergies, and candida, etc.). So basically I’m my own worst enemy. As far as vitamins and various other supplements go, which ones do you recommend as most important? I’ve been making a list of the various different things mentioned as helpful on the forum and I’m running out of paper. I’d like to focus on the more important ones first (since it can get quite expensive) before moving on to the lesser important items.

But unfortunately it’s often impossible to tell since I feel no different when I take them or not. However my doctor has advised me that they’re of benefit for my conditions, so I keep taking them. And, since I don’t buy them directly from the doctor, he’s not profiting by the purchase. I realize that I take a lot of “stuff”, but my doctor claims that since most are water soluble, I’ll normally excrete whatever my body doesn’t utilize. My mother was concerned about how many different things I take, so she asked her family doctor and he said that patients with certain medical conditions will continue to look for anything that might hopefully help them to improve.

0,lilysmom,430,"Hey everyone,  Im new to the diet and after doing body cleanse i started on the Candigone kit. After about 4 days on it taking it full strength i started having the worst anxiety/panic attacks ive ever had in my life, as well as other physical symptoms acting up like increased itching, weakness and brain fog etc. But the anxiety and panic was by far the worst and it was so bad that i thought i must have been allergic to something in the kit so i stopped taking it. At that time i didnt even know there was a “die off” so now that i do ive been taking it again for about a week and the anxiety seems to have lifted significantly. Has anyone else experienced this or know if its a common die off symptom? Also i was wondering if i could get a food recipe list. Thanks in advance for anyone who comments :)God Bless"
1,raster,430,"These all sound like die off symptoms. It is normal to experience anxiety for some people when detoxing from candida. Its all caused by the toxins releases by candida when it dies and problems with the liver. You need to protect the liver as good as possible when you do go through die-off because it isn’t completely easy to heal the liver later on in your treatment… Candigone is a multiantifungal product and it could be problematic because candida can get used to every one of those antifungals in time. You need to rotate antifungals so that this doesn’t happen; it’d be best to take black walnut, oregano oil extract, etc. all individually and it would be much cheaper. We developed this protocol to get better, if you are interested: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Email able900 for the strict forum foods list.

0,Chris UK,431,This is a serious question and one that I could really use some opinions on. My wife and I enjoy a healthy sex life but since I have been diagnosed with Candida and in particular yeast present in my mouth it made me wonder about how wise it is to take part in any sort of oral sex. Anyone have an opinion they would be willing to share? Thanks Chris
1,raster,431,"I wouldn’t worry about it too much because its very difficult for candida to jump between bodies in my opinion. I have no scientific evidence, but I bet less than 1% of people who have candida overgrowth transmit it to their partner…its very rare but can happen if their immune system is compromised already. -raster"

I felt symptom free for quite a while (1-2 months) until one day I bought some fish from the market. The fisherman told me they were wild caught fish but unfortunately for me he was lying. They were coming from a fish farm where most likely they are treated with antibiotics, growth hormones etc… My candida got back immediately… acne everywhere, ringworm, weight gain, indigestion and more. So now i’m doing the cleanse all over again. So the lesson learned…BE VERY CAREFUL OF THE QUALITY OF YOUR MEAT!"

2,lucyloo,436,"Hi Raster, it’s been a long road before finally realising Candida is probably the cause of all my problems. Trying to find a cure for my chronic constipation among other things, lead me to thinking I may be hypothyroid. Then I discovered that a lot of thyroid symptoms are very similar to Candida-I did the spit test…and here I am! I feel like I may have had Candida for years as I had a lot of anti-biotics as a kid, and it would explain a lot of things such as my infertility, digestive problems, brain fog, thinning hair etc. Is there a way of finding out what level of infestation I have (bearing in mind I live in UK and my GP would probably laugh me out of the surgery if I asked for tests!) Also, is there any way you can tell if things are improving other than just going by your symptoms? Thanks a lot."
3,raster,436,"You could do a comprehensive stool test; this most likely is not covered by insurance keep in mind. There’s a place in the US where you can get testing done called genova diagnostics. You send in your sample and they tell you what exists in the gut and at what levels. You could do it at the beginning and end of your treatment and see how you progress. I would do a test that measures what bacteria levels you have (such as h.pylori) in the gut and what parasites you may have. Keep in mind that parasites often can live in people with compromised immune systems and it can go hand in hand with candida overgrowth. The only problem with the testing is that everyone has candida and parasites; if you didn’t have candida, you would be dead…we need it to survive. So the test may be inconclusive since everyone has it. It is also expensive, maybe $100-200 US (I believe thats like 300-400 euros). -raster"
4,lucyloo,436,"I have actually been looking into this and have found someone in my area who does a test comprising of a stool test and a mouth swab which I’m seriously considering. It is very expensive but at least I will know for sure what’s going on with me. I’ve read that stool samples aren’t always reliable as the candida can be so well bedded into the gut wall it may not show up, but surely if that was the case I would be feeling a lot worse than I am now. Thanks for your help/advice. I will report back when I’ve decided what I’m going to do next."
5,lucyloo,436,"Hi everyone, especially Raster! I have to say you were spot on with your diagnosis. I had myself tested professionally and got the results today…which were clear! Obviously like you say I still do have some Candida but at completely normal levels. To be honest I was shocked as I was convinced I had it really badly, and my experience proves that the saliva test isn’t what it’s cracked up to be. No yeasts or moulds were found in my sample, though it has picked up a couple of minor things which can hopefully be put right with a good probiotic and digestive enzymes. So I guess my message is to get professionally tested folks!"

I was taking 200 mg of ADP and 100 mg of Diflucan per day. after being on this treatment program for a week, I began to feel the dreaded candida die off, from the excess of yeast cells being killed. my doctor gave me N.A.C. to help my liver he told me, as the liver works over drive to rid the body of the dead yeast cells. I have stopped taking the antifungals and probiotcs for a week and a half now and i still notice the following symptoms: – lower back pain -pelvic pain -urgency to urinate more frequently than normal -soreness on genital area – what feels like swollen glands in neck (like a cold is coming on but it hasnt quite hit yet) i am thinking this is a die off but i thought it would reduce by now after a week and a half of not taking the antifungals. maybe i am not taking enough things to help my liver? are my kidneys and bladder affected here too as i am urinating so much more frequently plus the lower back pain? is there some medications that are very effective at making this die off go away quicker? obviously i dont want antibiotics if i have some kind of infection because that just perpetuates the yeast cycle right lol. please help folks 🙂"

2,tlentz1108,440,"Thanks Able, I guess my problem is that I came onto this forum well into my own program and I don’t know where I would be in comparison to your protoccol. I felt that I needed some support and since I made my way often by trial and error, I’m sure that it doesn’t match up. I will tell you where I started. The typical symptoms over probably 20 years include: acid reflux, allergies, asthma, frequent urinary, bladder and kidney infections, IBS type symptoms (possibly Cecliac), acne, migranes, insomnia, foggy brain, forgetfulness, frequent colds, respiratory infections, sinus problems, food allergies and/or intolerances, and most recently in Jan 2012 I was hospitalized for choking, vomiting, becoming dehydrated and having severe stomach pain and bleeding from an ulcer. I ended up having a strictures in my esophagus that is diagnosed as Esosinophic Esophagitis (EE). This was the last straw and I was tired of the doctor’s and meds which didn’t ever address the cause, just the symptoms. After researching the internet, I started the following Jan 26, 2012: 1)Taking mastic gum, l-glutamine, manuka honey and dgl. This did heal the ulcer and helped with acid reflux, but I was still very sick and could not tolerate gluten and dairy products. Stopped these, except for the l-glutamine. Took a multi-vitamin until I understood that there was good reason to not take these. No longer needed anti-acids. 2)Started a Candida/Leaky gut diet. Not quite like yours, but probably similiar enough and it did help me. Even though it was helping, I still was feeling pretty bad and had many gut and IBS symptoms. Extremely fatigued, no energy. Allergy symptoms got better, didn’t need to take allergy meds or inhaler anymore. 3) Took Paragone in an attempt to kill the candida and parasite (didn’t understand that you can’t kill them off totally or cure it this way at first). This did clear my bowell and killed off a good amount of candida and parasites, but after taking this for a month, it lost it’s effectiveness b/c I didn’t understand the necessity to rotate antifungals and I still was infested. Still pretty fatigued, but not quite as bad. Headaches and insomnia getting little better. Lost 20lbs in two months. 4)During this time I also started taking a pre & probiotic called Syntol which despite some things that I know you don’t agree with in the ingredients(but I wasn’t aware of at that time) did help me and noticed alot of die off. Stopped taking this after 45 days, and started another probiotic “10” strain 50 billion+ per day without those ingredients. Started having less gut and IBS symptoms. Felt like my digestion and stools were getting better. 5)Also started taking various herbal teas with different herbal antifungals and rotated them. Started eating garlic, taking coconut oil (8 softgels at first, then 5T of ex vir org cold pressed coconut oil a day), oil of oregano, sunflower and pumpkin seeds, jalapenos, etc. Changed over to using celtic sea salt only. Began taking milk thistle to help with liver. Noticed some more die off, lessened as I went along. Skin better, no more choking and vomiting spells from the EE. 6)Began taking following vitamins and supplements: Carlson cod liver oil softgels – 4 per day (includes Vit A & D3) Super Fishol softgels – 4 per day  Vitamin A – 5000IU 2x day Vitamin C – 1000mg 3x day Vitamin E – 200IU 2x day Vitamin B complex – 50mg 2x day Zinc – 50mg 1x day *stopped taking this recently Niacin – 50mg 2x day Thiamin – 100mg 2x day Calcium Citrate – 500mg 2x day Magnesium Citrate – 250mg 2x day 7)Most all symptoms gone, only noticiable symptom was still a slightly white coated tongue. Changed toothpaste and started oil pulling about 4 weeks ago, and mouth, gums and teeth have improved. Did have a reaction the first time I did the oil pulling with excessive sneezing and mucous drainage, then got better. Energy getting better, less fatigue during day, and sleeping better at night. Weight has stablilized. 8)In past month, I have tried to increase my exercise since I totally stopped b/c wasn’t able to exercise due to extreme fatigue and no energy. This is my last area that I still don’t have the stamina and energy to exercise. Looking for ways to work this in and build back up. Anyway, this is what I have done over the past almost five months and where I came from. I know that it is not your protoccol and I would be curious where you think I fall in your program. I obviously don’t feel the need to start over as I feel pretty good, but I would like to know what if anything you think I should change, adjust, delete, add, and my chances at having cured or almost cured this beast. Many thanks, Teresa"

I felt that I needed some support and since I made my way often by trial and error, I’m sure that it doesn’t match up. Hello, Teresa. Following your own protocol will probably build your adrenals in time; of course you’ll need to continue consuming high doses of a good probiotic since the flora in the intestines make up 70% of the immune system; because if your immune system isn’t in good condition, this will make it more difficult to build your adrenals since the adrenals are part of the immune system as well and of course all the different parts are connected by the immune system itself. Also, since adrenal fatigue is partially caused by a compromised digestive system, the beneficial bacteria can help to correct this problem in time. Personally, I would want to vary and alternate the probiotic with different brands and strains; I would also be consuming kefir on a daily basis. Of course with our protocol, you wouldn’t be consuming honey (even manuka) because honey in general contains about 80 to 84% sugar in the form both sucrose and fructose. This makes it stronger than regular cane sugar as far as the sweetness is concerned. Both starches and all forms of sugar can weaken the adrenals because the sugar actually causes a shock the adrenal cortex. There are arguments against this, but there are also many arguments in favor of leaving all forms of sugar out of the picture when attempting to build the adrenals; personally, since there is plenty of research showing that the adrenals can be strengthened without honey, I would simply choose to avoid it. Our adrenal protocol is a lot like yours, but it also includes Pantethine, a dimeric form of pantothenic pantothenic acid (B5) adaptogenic herbs such as Ashwagandha and licorice root. Able"

I can’t sit all day and do any type of physical activity. If you’re still working to cure your Candida infestation, this means you’re also still working to build your adrenals and immune system. Part of the treatment is to obtain as much rest and sleep as possible. This necessarily excludes any strenuous exercise. For this reason, walking and mild swimming are recommended. Of course this means that a gym isn’t needed unless the gym has a swimming pool or you need a treadmill for the walking exercise. Able"
6,Javizy,440,"tlentz1108, Have you ever had any testing done? If you can’t tolerate gluten and your digestion isn’t perfect, you should be treating the stuff like cyanide. It can take months to recover if gluten is the problem, and even a trace amount can prevent the intestines from completely recovering. If you’ve developed leaky gut, which sounds likely given the allergies, you’re at risk of the auto-immune diseases that wheat can cause. In fact, I’d be testing thyroid function as a priority, because it’s at risk as long as wheat toxins can enter the blood, and any dysfunction can cause a catalogue of escalating symptoms. What Able said about diet, digestion, supplements, rest and immunity shows that adrenal fatigue is probably a symptom of poor health rather than a cause of anything itself. The adrenals respond to the signals they’re given. If they’re not pumping out enough cortisol, there must be a reason behind it. Taking a holistic approach is the best way to get to the bottom of it. I do think a hormone profile would give you some interesting info if you haven’t already had one done though. In the meantime, I’d avoid ketosis and strenuous exercise because these require large amounts of cortisol and disadvantage the thyroid."
7,tlentz1108,440,"Thanks Able & Javizy, I only took manuka at first as part of a treatment to heal my ulcer and kill h pylori. This was a priority at first when I got out of the hospital. Then after I was sure that my ulcer was gone and the h pylori at least in control, I stopped taking this b/c of the sugar. I will take the advice to rotate probiotics. I am almost out anyway, so will pick some up at Vitamin Shoppe. I prefer ones that don’t need refrigeration necessarily, but can use any I guess. Yeah, I know that my thyroid was effected as well as my adrenals, digestive system, neurological, etc. I also had high blood pressure and sugar spikes and drops often. These have improved also under the protoccol. I don’t have any confidence in the doctors in my area and quite frankly I’ve given up with the traditional routeafter 20years of following every advice, procedure, and prescribed medication which never has gotten me anywhere. I’m not going to spend anymore money on tests and doctors, unless I am having an urgent or emergency. Well, I am going to go kayaking and bicycle riding this weekend with my family, but I’m going to take it easy. The water isn’t particulary challenging and the trails are mostly level. I’m only going to go for a half day of exercise each day instead of the full days that I use to do. Thanks for your advice & thoughts. Have a great weekend. Teresa"
8,raster,440,"I just wanted to mention that the adrenals (for me) were the last thing to get healed, and this is one of the things that will take the most time to heal. You’ll likely be able to heal leaky gut before the adrenals. As far as dealing with low energy…I give it my all for some of these strenuous activities but I try to limit myself on how far I push myself. For instance, my main outdoor activity is hiking. I try to do 2-4 miles hikes instead of 5+ miles hikes…those will tax me too much. Even washing my car and waxing it as taxing; I try to put it off until the good weather comes around here lol. Gardening was one of the few things I could do early on but it was tough because of the molds found on the plants. Its all about finding a balance and slowly pushing yourself a tiny bit more. -raster"
9,tlentz1108,440,"Hey Raster, Yeah, I have tried pushing exercise the past month. Before this my main exercise was walking during the worst part of treatment. I found hiking to be difficult, mostly because my area is mountainous and trails can be challenging even if short. Though I love to hike, I think that it might be best if I continue the basic walking for now. Even the biking isn’t too bad if it’s mostly level,can coast some when tired. Swimming is another exercise that I think I can do without taxing myself too much, even if it isn’t the kind of swimming I use to do. Going to also check out some of the other supplements that Able mentioned (Panththine and ashwagandha). I am getting licorice root in one of my herbal teas and I still take DGL chewables(without sugar) on occasion if I have some throat irritation. I will check out the suggested doses on the licorice root, I’m a little concerned about licorice with my past history with high blood pressure. Thanks for the support, Teresa"

0,captainamerica,442,"Hello, I wanted to get a good answer as to brown rice. Im sure someone has asked this a million times on here so sorry. My question is this, I have decided to cook large amounts of brown rice and organic chicken and vegetables, put them together and eat this for every meal of the day to avoid any contaminants that could feed problem. Should this be ok? I get soooo many back and forth, conflicting answers on internet of course. Thank you in advance for your answers!"
1,raster,442,"I would not do this and eating brown rice and brown rice products can significantly set back your progress. Rice contains starch and low amounts of sugar; both can feed candida. A great alternative to brown rice is to eat buckwheat which contains only 25% starch and is a prebiotic which feeds beneficial bacteria in the gut. It also has a similar texture and taste when compared to rice. I have a good buckwheat recipe if you want to try it out; add olive oil, sea salt, rosemary, and basil to give it some flavor! It also is a good general idea to do a food rotation diet where you rotate between a few different food items so that candida won’t find one source of food to feed on. For instance, rotate between buckwheat, millet, and rice instead. I would consider rice to be a cheat food item; something you can eat when you want to live it up. I would eat it maybe once every 2 weeks or less frequently personally. As you get better, your body can digest certain foods better such as rice, and at this point (stage 2) you can start eating it a little more often. One of the negatives about rice is that your body cannot digest it easily if you have candida and it often ferments in the gut (or isn’t completely digested). Foods that ferment in the gut should be avoided at all costs. When I eat rice I become more constipated, bloated, and it comes up undigested in my stools. A great alternative to brown rice is to eat black, wild, or red rice which have greater nutritional properties. -raster"

The website even incorporates some of the material from the forum but we haven’t really mentioned it before. They did a big redesign recently and added a coconut bread recipe, information about leaky gut, etc. From my experience with the diet (been on it 1 year), brown rice really set me back earlier in my treatment when I was my most sensitive.

I have been treating my ailment for 3.5 months now and am better off than I was for the 4 years prior that I had no idea what it was. My question is this, and I realize that it does not have a set answer. I read so many accounts of people feeling like garbage but not many people post success stories. I was wondering what an average timeline is for getting your gut flora back to normal and re-joining the populace of normal people in the world who can just eat food and feel normal. I have read something about 6-10 month range etc. I realize that your actions dictate how long this all takes but I need to get an idea of what I am looking at. A person can get very depressed reading the internet regarding any illness but especially with one that hits close to home. Anyone who is very knowledgable on this topic, please chime in.

There is one major exception; and that’s Swedish Digestive  Bitters which “must” be in a liquid form. However, the Swedish bitters are available in an alcohol-free extract so always look for this one. If you’re shopping for any kind of herb such as Ashwagandha, always look for a powder form which comes in a capsule instead of a liquid extract.

Did you know that some herbs require 100% pure alcohol in order to extract? Powered herbs, on the other hand, haven’t been altered in any way; better dosing at a lower cost is another advantage of the powder form.

0,Able900,447," When a child is suffereing from a Candida overgrowth, just cutting out all sugar products and cutting down on the carbs can help them considerably because no one, including children need the amount of sugar or carbs that’s found in an average diet. You can use pure virgin coconut oil to cook with and also add it to any foods that you possibly can for the child to ingest. Dairy is one of the main food products that should normally be removed from the diet. Of course children need calcium, so a healthy and perfect replacement is kefir. You can purchase the Lifeway brand of kefir which is carried by some health food stores as well as supermarkets. Purchase the plan type and if you need to, you can add Stevia to it for a more palliative taste. It’s usually found in the yogurt section of supermarkets. If you’re unaware of what kefir is, it’s a fermented milk drink similar to yogurt, but stronger. Kefir can help a lot to build the beneficial bacteria communities in your system much more sufficiently than yogurt can. Also, unsweetened coconut milk is closer to human breast milk than any other type; it just doesn’t contain the same amount of protein. As far as a detox period or cleanse for children is concerned, I don’t believe that a cleanse is safe for children. If the child is not already eating organic chicken, then it’s fine to add this as well as coconut or oat bran bread to the diet, but I would still try to limit animal meat to chicken or fish most of the time, and leave beef and pork out of their diet as much as possible. The ammonia released by the meat protein will have a detrimental effect on the treatment. If they eat eggs, I would definitely purchase organic eggs only. Of course, organic means that they will not be ingesting hormones or antibiotics. There’s a chance that a child will experience die-off symptoms sometime during their treatment. Candidate made by Native Remedies will help this considerably and can be given to children age four and over. The instructions are children ages 4-11 can take 1 drop per year of age, 3 times daily. This will greatly lessen the effects of die-off. For more information as well as the ingredients the link is: http://www.nativeremedies.com/products/candidate-systemic-candida-albicans.html In the end, no matter what else is done, the environment of the intestines will have to be changed in order to cure the Candida infestation. The only thing that can do that is an abundance of beneficial bacteria supplied by a good probiotic in addition to the intake of daily kefir; only these sources are able to build the flora in the intestines in the numbers that are needed, and in the end, this will be the cure for the infestation. The diet is used to stop feeding the Candida and limit the population growth of the infestation while the beneficial bacteria are multiplying to a number which will be able to bring about a change to the environment and ultimately destroy the Candida albicans cells. Finding a good children’s probiotic which is strong enough to do this is imperative to the cure. If you look at liquid forms, be sure to read the entire list of ingredients and run the list by the forum before making your purchase. Able"
0,DancePants,448,Im on day 2 of the cleanse. I took a nap this morning and woke up with my heart pounding hard. I could hardly walk. My face was extremely colorless.

I found out I had canadida 31/2 months ago. I thought I was doing great, felt good (no more burning stomach stomach or hunger pains)lost weight etc but I was eating a few things I shouldn’t have (by accident)so my burning came back.

Some people can deal with fasting, but if you can’t then you should just eat. Where’s the backing for it anyway? Going low-carb too fast can cause thyroid and hormone problems and candida can feed on ketones just fine, so you may even experience a flare-up. A messed up thyroid is about as helpful to the treatment as replacing water with Pepsi. Proceed with caution."

According to a research study reported by the International Journal of Microbiology Research in 2009, just 150 mg of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was able to stop the cell growth of Candida albicans. A higher level of 250 mg reduced proteinase secretion which is an important mechanism reflecting the effectiveness of Candida albicans as a fungal pathogen.  You definitely want vitamin C as part of your treatment against the infestation. Just don’t take it immediately after exercising.In the case of Candida dieting, is the body under alot of this kind of stress generally? The Candida itself causes stress and so does the die-off toxins if you don’t make plans to control these beforehand. The diet can be stressful in the beginning, probably because of having to become accustomed to living without so many carbs and sugar. Able"

I know this is die off, but my anxiety is so bad that I cannot function. my heart is pounding,head if full of pressure also headaches and am having difficulty going to sleep. my gyno prescribed diflucan and i’m afraid to start it because of severe die off. advice please…help…. You need to cut back on the amount of antifungals ‘now’ … stop the SF722 completely for the time being. Continue taking the molybdenum and add one pill for the time being making a total of 1000 mcg a day. Only take this amount for a few days or until the symptoms have vanished. what can I expect with the diflucan in terms of die off….help You can expect more die-off symptoms and more toxins in your body. Don’t take this yet. Wait at least a week before taking it and then only if you feel fine and clear of all die-off symptoms at that time. You can post your symptoms if there are any at that time before starting the Diflucan.….anything else I can do to rid of die off? Take a sauna or soaking in a tub of hot water draws the toxins out via perspiration. The aldehyde toxins released by the dying Candida are just as bad if not worse on your body as the Candida are. See if you can locate an herb by the name of Ashwagandha and take two capsules a day. This will help your general anxiety and also help you to sleep better throughout the treatment. Able"

It’s not bad enough to effect me at work or anything, but I can definitely feel it. And then after a while I feel perfectly normal again. Is it normal to only feel die off right after taking an antifungal and only for a few hours? I always imagined die off to be kind of a constant feeling."
1,cerenurt,454,"Well, the sick feelings with that dosage stopped after a few days, so I’m assuming it was die-off and that my body adjusted. I’ve learned to just listen to my body and up the dosage if I am still feeling ok, lessen it if I feel bad. At this point I will see how I feel with 4 pills 3 times a day."

Before and since I took the capsule I was following a type of safe diet and felt amazing most of the time, just really unsure why I’ve got all these new symptoms – well since January. A chap in my local health food store said that I might of triggered a stronger die-off reaction but as I say I only took one capsule.

You might not have any adverse reactions to this one slip. Whether you do or not, obviously it’s best if you don’t repeat it. I know that it’s hard when you have to give up foods and drinks that you use to love, but you have to desire getting better more than these foods that tempt you. I don’t know if you journal what you eat, drink or any supplements and treatments that you may do at this point, but it is really helpful if you plan out your meals ahead and you write about how you feel, any symptoms and reactions experienced. Plus, if you experience any brain fog and forgetfulness it helps to keep track. This has been a real motivator to me to keep going, especially when I read back how far I’ve come and how bad it was. I never want to experience it again. Best wishes, Teresa"

1,raster,458,"Hello Cora, The first thing I’d check out is the protocol we developed on the forum to get better: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx To answer your questions: 2) Most forum members eat greek yogurt which typically has a smaller amount of sugar per servings, something between 8-11g per serving is ideal. So change your brand if you want to go to a lower sugar yogurt. Making it at home also allows it to have less sugar than commercial yogurts. 3) Here’s the stories of success post: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm14080_Testimonies-of-Success.aspx#post14080 I am sure this forum has more success stories but most people don’t come back when they regain their health. 4) You should experience die-off symptoms very soon after starting the diet and antifungals…within a day/hour or two. This makes most people feel worse than before the diet. It should take a few weeks to a few months to start to feel better and notice the symptoms lifting from your body. We have a strict forum food list if you are interested in a copy. If so, email able900 for a link. -raster"

Thank you so much in advance 1. Just head over to the recipe sections of the website, be careful though as I know alot of members(myself included) are following an even stricter version of the diet. 2. I have never been sold on yogurt and have always had reactions to even plain yogurt. Like you said, it contains 17 grams of sugar which in the lactose form is going to feed yeast. Plus you can buy much stronger probiotics than what yogurt contains. 3. I havent completely cured myself but have been on some version of the diet since February 2011. I had a major setback in January 2012 and totally relapsed but have been back on a program since then and while im not cured I feel significantly better. It takes time but the diet, along with anti-fungals, and probiotics will help you start feeling better. 4. I would say about 2 months this time before I started noticing the symptoms getting better. The die-off is almost immediatly from my experience. The program works but you have to keep in mind it takes dedication and discipline. This isnt something you are going to knock out over the weekend or anything. By most accounts I have read it takes 8-12 months to be completely symptom free."

1,Marbro,462,"Cloves and Juniper Berries salve can help itching. Betulin which is extracted from Birch has shown positive results against psoriasis and dermatitis. Said to have anti itch qualities but Its being studied and used over sees and I dont have much info on it. I am following it and If I find information ill share it. White birch trees are ubiquitous in cold climates. A photo of the white tree against white snow is iconic of New England winters. A bark extract called Betulin (a terpene like tea tree oil) has been shown in animal studies to be antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and to aid in wound healing. Research presented at the annual congress of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology showed that a cream containing betulin significantly reduced itching in red, irritated skin in psoriasis and eczema patients. The study is only preliminary, and betulin will need to be tested in rigorous trials to see if the extract makes a cream much better than placebo cream; however, betulin is already available in creams in Europe. http://thedermblog.com/2010/02/19/extract-from-white-birch-tree-relieves-itch/"

0,heahea,464,"Hey everybody! I’m new to this forum, but have been on Candida Diet for about three weeks now. I feel like this diet is more than a way to improve my health, it’s more like a way to see the world. But yeah… Well, I have thought of some things, but haven’t found the answer. I hope you can help me. And on the other hand, maybe my story will inspire someone. 🙂 Not sure, if it’s more of advice or a story, but I believe it fits in this category well. Actually, my problem is a minor one, as I my Candida wasn’t too severe. I’m 21, with quite good health, except low hemoglobin in my blood and not being able to digest lactose, but it hasn’t bothered me much. I had an usual life of a college student – occasional stress, not-healthy-enough eating habits (but not the worst ones either), some drinking. I had never taken antibiotics. Until I got a nasty inflammation and took antibiotics for it. I didn’t think much of what it could cause me. I got better and almost thought, well I guess that’s all. Soon after it I went to a party, had a couple of drinks… But I think you all know what alcohol might do to an already vulnerable just-stopped-taking-antibiotics body. Suddenly I got uncomfortable itch in my, um… lady parts. I got worse and worse. I googled it, realized it’s probably yeast overgrowth and started the diet. As I was really eager to get better, I started it really agressively. No cheating (and I didn’t) nor slow-and-steady approach. I didn’t use any medicament, just strict diet (also, preferrably organic and/or local) and probiotic kefir of local producer (and a lot of it in various forms!). I wish I had that kind of willpower for my exams, too… 🙂 So, after 10-11 days I started to feel what I think were the die-off symptoms (swollen allergic rash on arms and legs, eye irritation, headache, irratability, short breath, low libido, etc). I didn’t change my diet much, except that I added some green apples for extra vitamins, increased water intake (to 2.5 liters, I guess? And also, water as first thing in the morning, hot and with lemon slice to wake up my metabolism!), I used skin brushing, contrast showers, sauna and some extra exercise. Plus a nice long sleep every night. And now (on day 21, I think, but not sure), I feel great! And without any extra chemicals and medicaments added! Of course, maybe it works only in cases like mine, when the candida hasn’t developed to much and you start the treatment early. But I’d say WILL is the key ingredient. BUT! Actually, it took just a few days for the die-off symptoms to back off, so I’m a little suspicious – is it possible to reach it so fast? Or is it possible that the infection “moved away” from one of my body parts to another and I just can’t feel it right now? I have continued my diet so far, but I’m considering reintroducing some foods. You are all very inspiring and thank you! Kris"
1,raster,464,"I think that candida likely became dormant in the body and it will be waiting for a good time to feed! I’ve never heard of anyone getting over candida this quickly, so I think you likely have a ways to go.

However, after getting the strict diet information from Able, and getting the necessary supplements to prepare my liver, I’m going to start again with the strict diet, b/c I was eating chicken and nuts before. I have been going through the strict diet and I am hoping you all can give me some suggestions. Are there different ways you can eat these veggies or can you only eat them raw or steamed?

So far the majority of what I’ve been eating these last several weeks is raw lettuces/field greens (I could just as easily go outside and pull some things out of the ground and it would taste about the same), and veggies. Occasionally, I have stir fried the veggies in coconut and olive oil, and I have baked some cauliflower and asparagus. Most things are void of flavor.

What did you have in mind? Once you’ve finished with the detox, mustard made with ACV is acceptable on the diet. My favorite way of eating eggs were to boil them and make deviled eggs. All I used was the mustard and salt & pepper mixed with the yolk. You can also make egg salad this way by chopping the white part of the egg along with the yellow. I would spread this on toasted coconut bread or oat bran bread. The mustard gives you a tangy taste that’s otherwise missing in the strict diet.

2,Hilary,466,"I have looked through the recipe section, but either I’m not doing something right or I’m mostly seeing recipes for Stage 2. What soups are you all referring to? Are you making your own broth? How are you doing that? How are you making the mustard Able. Is it dry mustard and ACV? That I would enjoy! I was also looking for a snack that has some flavor, instead of just raw celery or cucumbers and the like. I am still struggling with cravings, especially with my husband and kids around, so anything with a little flavor or kick would help I think! Thanks for any suggestions. I think the coconut bread will help. I’m allergic to buckwheat though, any suggestions on alternatives or should I just leave it out. Also, are teff, oat bran, and millet flours GF? I’ve seen a few variations of the coconut bread and I’m not sure what to try. Any thoughts?"

0,Cora,467,"I am on about day 9 or 10 of the strict diet. and about 7th day of taking oil of oregano. I seem to have a lot of energy and my digestion has been great (which it never is) but I am not sure if it’s the lessening of the yeast or just that I am eating healthier. I have felt really well so far and the only thing that would even resemble “die off” was a couple of anxiety attacks yesterday and the day before. But then again anxiety is not abnormal for me. I feel so discouraged. Here I am eating this way and have no way of telling if I am killing any yeast at all! How do I know if I am making any headway, and how long do I need to be carb free to be healthy again? I am wondering if this may be all for nothing. Is it possible to be killing yeast but feeling good?"
1,Chris24,467,"Technically you are not killing yeast, its the fungus we are trying to control. You didnt mention antifungals or probiotics? You cant beat candida with diet, diet is only there as a neccesary support for the rest. It seems strange to me that you have energy. The first week in particular should be hell with die off. This makes me wonder if you really have a candida overgrowth?"
2,Cora,467,"Yup plenty of energy. I am taking coconut oil, oil of oregano, and a probiotic. Like I said I feel great except for some axiety. I really self diagnosed, but I was so sure this was my problem. I fit the bill perfectly. I have been on so many antibiotics over the last 10 years i can’t even remember them all. I have had so many unexplained health problems. I thought for sure candida was to blame. This is all so confusing. Does everyone have a rough die off?"
3,Able900,467,"Does everyone have a rough die off? The goal should be to not have a rough die-off period but rather to avoid the die-off toxins at all cost. The toxins that cause die-off symptoms can be just as dangerous as a Candida overgrowth is. Are you taking Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate as we instruct in the protocol? If you’re following protocol, then you may or may not experience die-off symptoms, but if you do it should be rather light or mild symptoms. What symptoms did you experience that led you to believe you have a Candida infestation? Able"
0,Flipper,468,"I’m pretty new to this. I have had fatigue issues on and off for years and years and started a general cleanse diet 3 months ago with the help of a nutritionist. About 3 weeks ago I further eliminated all the foods that feed Candida at the suggestion of a few health practitioners. So now I’m doing the probiotics, taking magnesium, enzymes, and a variety of vitamins. I’m becoming a coconut I think and garlic is my best friend (and only friend now). After 3 weeks I’m feeling worse and worse. Just so tired most of the day. I am (or was) an athlete and I can’t do more than what used to be a warm up for me. Any advice as to how long I should wait before I just give up?"
1,charlie1,468," Hey Flipper, As somebody who has also suffered from fatigue very heavily and also played sport and fitness I know how hard it can be. When you say you feel so tired most of the day I can totally relate to this as I suffered like that for many years and still do a little now. I was so confused so much of the time as I din’t have a clue why it was happening and doctors just kept telling me it was because I must be depressed. Last year I changed my diet and miraculous things happened which proved the doctors wrong however, have not managed to keep it that way. I still haven’t completely worked it all out yet, can’t be 100% that I actually have candida but I know that it has something do with food and/or digestion, the gut is a very complicated maze. What I have done since about a year ago is keep studying about the gut and just learning as much as I can, that’s the only thing has has kept me going. As I say the gut is a very complicated area and it’s why doctors come up with IBS, it’s just a way of telling patients that they don’t know what’s wrong with them. Keep going, I know it’s not easy to do but try to keep mentally strong through it. I would study as much as you can and get a much more rounded view. Study about the gut area in general, about diet and anything related. I know that sounds obvious and you may already be doing this but it’s really important as you will find something new that you din’t know and can be just what your looking for. You might just read something that makes something click or a lightbulb moment happen that may at times even contradict a medical specialist which has happened for me a few times. It’s fast becoming the case that a lot of people can actually help themselves better than health services can. I can’t really give you any specific advice other than what I’ve said but you should always be careful when eliminating lots of foods. It can be very dangerous as you may not be getting vital nutrients and vitamins even if you’ve been advised to in some cases. I am speaking from experience with that as well. I’m definitely no expert but I know there’s at least a couple of people on here who are close and have some very useful advice from what I’ve read on the forum. I’ve done searches for die-off symptoms and found some very good posts to other questions so maybe you could try and do some searching. This place is a great resource! Really sorry I can’t help you further – but keep going & Goodluck!"
2,charlie1,468," Actually, just wanted to say that I read a lot of books about IBS which, you may not think helpful but can actually be. Some IBS books give quite a general rounded view of the gut which I think can be beneficial knowledge."
3,Flipper,468,"Thanks Charlie1. I haven’t had any problems with stomach pain or anything that would lead me to IBS, so I haven’t considered it. It may be that I’m missing nutrients. Either that I’m not taking them in or that my body isn’t processing them. I’m going to add mineral drops to what I’m doing since that has the trace minerals. It is so complicated and interconnected. Right now from noon till 5:00 I’m exhausted and useless, and that isn’t going to work for me for long! (I have kids, need to work not to mention my love of swimming etc. ) Also the mind his a very big player in all things physical I think, but I don’t really know where to go with that at the moment. Thanks again."
4,Chris24,468,"Yeah this is a difficult topic with candida. It seems like the diet makes us feel worse and worse with fatigue, but at the same time we cant fall back to normal eating habits because then we’ll never get better. The stuggle will only get worse. Sometimes you’ll feel like you are getting sicker, but actually you’re getting better. Its not easy. Personally, I never made a week without cheating on the diet, and 3 months in (1 month ago) I gave up completely, because I was always just SO tired and depressed, and healthy food didnt make me feel different. However, I kept improving because my mind (the presumed cause of my candida) was getting better, I kept taking my candida killer (chlorine dioxide), and kept taking probiotics, and it seems my effort on the diet before paid off after all. My energy/endurance is just way better then before, improvements that i didnt notice while being on the diet. Only now I see how much I actually improved. Im still in the process of curing though. Personally, i like to take antifungals at night before sleeping so they dont bother me during the day. They can cause some really bad fatigue. You should take more antifungals as garlic alone is really not enough. Probiotics are best taken on an empty stomach. I like to take them in the morning."

This is the kefir bible and should answer all your questions: http://users.chariot.net.au/~dna/Makekefir.html You could start with the FAQ http://users.chariot.net.au/~dna/kefir-faq.html Briefly, it’s probably best to drink by itself to give the microbes the best chance of reaching the colon. You can refrigerate it after a 24-hour ripening, which is done after straining the grains after fermenting for 36-hours or so. It’s best to use a non-metallic strainer, and it tastes like really sour plain yoghurt. If think it’s an acquired taste, and you’ll probably like it after a while. The other questions depend on you.Latka wrote: Does anyone have experience in ordering kefir grains overseas – do they survive the sending that can be 10-12 days?

I am also desperately seeking kefir grains and cannot get hold of any here in the Northern Europe. I think there’s a good chance they’ll be okay if they’re dehydrated. Even live ones can last around a week or so without milk. Try to find dehydrated ones with the fastest shipping possible and get them straight in milk when they arrive. The package can be as light and small as a letter, so express delivery shouldn’t be that pricey. Remember they take a few 24-hour fermentations to “wake-up” and might even produce some gross slime at first. It could take up to a week of daily milk changing, and then you can start 48-hour fermentations."

0,charlie1,471,"Hi there, I had a food intolerance test last year which told me I had a Candida imbalance and it told me to exclude certain foods from my diet which, I did and I felt much better. I went on and off the diet quite a bit over last year but always found that I felt better when I stuck to it. Every time I did it would always take about 5 days of feeling slightly worse then better which I’m guessing was the die-off reaction happening. Fast-forward to January this year and I took a 500mg capsule of Pau D’Arco which gave me quite a nasty stomach ache after. I’ve been sticking to the diet rigidly since then but have found that I have this very specific gnawing pain/sensation at the top of my stomach which is a similar symptom to a stomach ulcer. This has only been happening since I took the capsule. I have been to-and-fro to the doctors who have kept prescribing stomach acid suppressing drugs which have not worked and actually made things worse at times. After ruling out many other conditions I’m only left with possibility that this could be a new more intense die-off symptom. The only thing is that the stomach pain/discomfort along a bit of fatigue are the only symptoms I’m getting and not the others listed on the website. The stomach pain can be horrendous at times but could this be die-off? Many Thanks in advance!"
1,Latka,471,"Hi! I can’t answer if this is die-off, however one thing struck me as I was reading your post; I’ve read that the toxins from candida often lower stomach acidity. So if you have Candida chances are you aren’t producing enough acid. This might explain why the acid suppressing medication prescribed to you does not help, even makes you feel worse?"

0,Able900,474,"Most enzyme supplements contain two enzymes which are not naturally produced by humans. They’re specifically cellulase and hemicellulase. In theory, it makes sense to assume that a supplement of enzymes such as Candex and Candidase can treat a Candida infestation because the Candida have a wall which contains cellulose and hemicellulose (note the difference in the spelling of cellulose, cellulase, hemicellulose, and hemicellulase). Therefore in theory enzyme supplements can help kill the Candida by digesting their cell walls. On the other hand these enzymes are not specific to Candida walls, and in fact the enzymes will also break down the cellulose and hemicellulose that’s in the foods, such as vegetables that we eat at practically every meal. And the byproduct of the enzymatic breakdown of cellulose and hemicellulose is sugar that feed Candida. Therefore I really don’t think that the enzymes are going to work. All they’ll do is kill some of the Candida while feeding the remainder leading to a rebound. The answer as far as obtaining safe enzymes during your infestation is Swedish Digestive Bitters. Able"

My only symtom from candida is a decended bloated belly, weight gain, berping,and inability to lose weight. I am tiny so the bolated belly was very noticable to me and I kept going to by DR. for test determined for a diagnosis. It took almost 2 years to get an answer.  After my Dr. ran every medical test under the sun he finally did a blood test and can back with positive for Candida.

3,Javizy,480,"This article provides a pretty good overview of probiotic issues. A couple of good snippets:In most situations, probiotic administration results in an increase in fecal counts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, a decrease in fecal pH, and a decline in those bacterial enzyme activities that are associated with the development of colon cancer. … Bifidobacterium longum administration (as a pharmaceutical) resulted in higher fecal bifidobacterial and lower clostridial counts, lower fecal pH, and lower fecal ammonia concentrations. They should provide similar benefits for everyone, but how much you notice it will probably depend on the condition of your gut flora. If you’re missing a lot of bacteria, the impact might be more pronounced. It’s also important to take a high dosage. There seems to be a threshold level in most cases, which could be in the hundreds of billions. More strains also offer more benefits. ThreeLac is like a drain with dollar bills running down it.

You need to stimulate bile production for them to be absorbed or they’ll just slide straight through your intestines. Saturated fat also protects them from peroxidation, something that would ironically make them inflammatory and harmful. The last thing to keep in mind is minimising omega-6s. This should be easy on the diet, since vegetable oils and corn-fed animal products aren’t a part of it, although you might want to go easy on the buckwheat and avoid oat and rice bran. Olive oil is okay, but aim to get most of your calories from saturated fat. This balance of fats also detriments candida."

0,desperately seeking good health,484,"I have been suffering from symptoms that no medical Dr. could tell me what were caused from, only that I needed to be on anti-depressants. I refused and began my journey in search of what was wrong in my body. My (gyno) Dr. had me on bio-identical progesterone even though my hormone levels were within normal range. As a result, my GP took me off of it when I began having severe panic attacks as the progesterone has an enzyme in it that will breakdown your serotonin levels (which I did not know). I thought all along that my adrenals were under too much stress. I went to a holistic Dr. who is also a medical Dr. and did a saliva test for adrenals and everything came back normal with the exception of DHEA being a little low. He suggested Candida overgrowth and wanted me to do a $150 blood test to confirm. I do not have the funds to do the test. Went to a health food store and the owner was actually treated by the same Dr. 15 yrs prior. She said this is what he would prescribe…. (3 month program), so I bought it along with Renew Life Ultimate Flora critical care 50 billion. She said I had to take them together to avoid die-off. Can you look at the Aquaflora product and tell me if this is what I need to be taking or if it’s wasted time and money. I also had allergy testing done at my GP and have suddenly developed food allergies to everything. No nuts, except brazil, no grains, can have seafood except for scallops and oysters. no fruits except blueberries. Since the panic attacks in February, I have not been eating anything that I thought would be causing the problems. Then after the allergy testing, I realized I was eating nuts and brown rice and pears or apples almost daily and they were causing problems. I have been on the Aquaflora for 2 weeks and last night felt really bad and anxious at bedtime. Could this be a form of die-off? Is it ok for me to treat my gut with L-Glutamine and quercetin?

1,princeofsin,485,Candida dieters should avoid milk because it is hard on the digestive system which is already impaired in those with candida overgrowth. Since lactose is the problem lactose free milk should be okay for the candida diet provided it does not have any other troublesome ingredients.
2,Positivo,485,Kefir would be way more beneficial. Make your own at home with kefir grains and regular milk. The instructions are here http://users.chariot.net.au/~dna/Makekefir.html

The question about the milk is just cause I really love the taste, and it could be some kind of treat, to have once in a while… Thanks guys!"
0,missiello,486,"I am pretty sure I am a candida sufferer. I had a really bad sinus infection December of 2011 and I was prescribe two antibiotics and a steroid. Boy, did it mess me up. First, I instantly got a terrible yeast infection after being on treatment for a few days. Weeks later I noticed that if I ate certain heavy meals, I would feel nauseous for a few hours but never throw up. It was terrible. It seemed like it would just get worse and worse and weeks went on. Another huge symptom I had was acid reflux. So I did some research and started taking Betaine HCL and or apple cider vinegar. That helped sometimes, but I still didn’t feel that much better. The other big symptom is abdominal cramps. Sometimes they are painful, other times they last for hours and are just this dull annoying pain. Occasional bloating, headaches, and belching are other symptoms as well. I took it upon myself to go see a naturpathic doctor, since it seemed as if going to a regular doctor was what made me sick in the first place. I described my symptoms to her and she told me that all my symptoms sound like I’m suffering from candida. I was advised to go on the candida diet. However, she’s wasn’t as strict on me as the diet on this website. I basically have been going gluten free, avoiding sugar, vinegar, and alcohol. She allowed me to eat natural sugar like fruit and still drink apple cider vinegar. She also put me on Candaclear Four which are basically garlic pills and one 25 billion probiotic pill I take once a day. Well, it has almost been a month and I feel like I am getting better but the process is very very very slow. Some days I feel great and others I still feel like crap. There have been days I have cheated and I felt like I have paid the price for it. For instance, today I had half a sandwich with white bread and a frappucino. I felt fine for a few hours and then by the time dinner rolled around I had no appetite and all the nasty symptoms. Nausea, abdominal cramps, the whole works. My boyfriend tried to take me out for thai and I couldn’t even look at it! I guess I’m just really frustrated. My question is when does this all get better? Months? Years? I’m going to see my naturpath this Saturday but I feel like I need more guidance from people like me. I’ve also noticed I still get a little itchy down there with some discharge but it never gets too bad. Any guidance will help and I’m going to continue reading these boards. I know my post is kind of long but thank you for whoever reads this."

Staying on your current diet, it might take years before some serious results (just guessing, this really depends on how bad your infestation is) or it ay never happen as you are still feeding candida and it will adapt to the single antifungal you are taking. Also, you need strong probiotic with many strains of good bacteria to beat candida. People following forum’s strict diet and protocol see a big improvement in symptoms sometimes in matter of just few months, although fully healing your gut can take 6-18 months so if you want to do this plan to be on modified and healthy diet for quite a while. Going back to the old diet too soon makes candida return, at times much worse than before. So if your infestation is recent and not as bad, you might feel relief pretty soon and perhaps within 6 months or so you can start introducing new foods, but there is no set timeline. None of us really knows how bad it is until you try to get rid of it. I’ve been on the diet for 4 months and managed to get rid probably 90% of my symptoms. My initial plan was to do this for a month and be done with it. Now I laugh at how silly I was. I had no idea my infestation was so bad and once some of the symptoms I had for 25 years started going away I realized that I do have candida overgrowth in some form for most of my life. Do not plan to do this if you are not able to commit to it. If you keep trying kill the candida and feed it at the same time you will be stuck in the never ending circle and finally broke down and say this diet doesn’t work. Stay away from cheating and try not to set yourself back and you should be fine. Nobody can do it for you, you must do it yourself. Others can just offer advice and support. Good thing is that you do have naturopath who can also offer some support and advice, although because of allowing fruit and other items candida feeds on makes me question if that person really knows enough about candida overgrowth. There is plenty of information and support on this forum so if you decide to do this and have questions or just need to vent your frustrations we are all here. I find it that only people who do go through some form of the same issues I do can really understand me. The world outside of candida is so ignorant about it, but then again I was the same way until I found out I have it 🙂 Wishing you best of luck no matter what you decide! Arijana"
4,raster,486,"Hello Missiello, It sounds like the diet plan your naturopath has put you on is an OK basic one that is similar to the mcomb’s plan, however I would consider this for later in your treatment when your body is more able to cope with natural sugars, starches, etc. The diet most of the people on the forum use is rather strict and breaks down the possibilities of your diet to only beneficial food items. So basically it will allow you to heal faster and heal the gut. You may want to consider an anti-inflammatory diet that has more items such as broccoli, salmon, blueberries, etc…this will allow the stress on your gut to reduce while it can heal. If I were to eat only one fruit on the diet, I would choose blueberries because they are low in sugar, molds, and are anti-inflammatory. The key to your success in the long term is a good probiotic that has a high number of strains and high billion count. Greek yogurt and kefir are other good sources of probiotics. It’ll take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth and I’ve personally been on the diet for a year and am pretty much symptom free. There are a lot of supplements that will help you along, and I know of some really good ones that will help you heal faster if you are interested. SF722 undecenoic acid, HMF neuro, fermented cod liver oil, and miracle fiber are the foundations of my success. If your naturopath does acupuncture, I would continue to do this as much as possible as it will aid in your recovery. Hope this helps! -raster"
5,Pattinoo,486,"Raster, what does the acupuncture help with? What is the primary thing you ask for them to address?"
6,raster,486,"Acupuncture heals your organs, helps detox toxins, helps rejuvinate the body to get it working naturally again. It does so many things that I cannot even begin to list what it can do. I mostly use it for digestive reasons, but lately have been using it to heal my liver which has been heavily damaged by prior drug and alcohol abuse, as well as from the toxins by candida. I highly recommend trying it out as you gain more energy; it is more effective with the more energy your body has…so if you are rather low energy, it won’t really do too much to help you heal right now. I made this mistake early on thinking it could cure my health problems alone, however what I’ve learned is that its most effective later in your treatment. -raster"

SF722 undecenoic acid, HMF neuro, fermented cod liver oil, and miracle fiber are the foundations of my success..  Can you please explain what these do and where is the best place to get them? Miracle fiber sounds like something to use in the Stage 1 cleansing phase (like on this site, not the forum). Shouldnt there be a concern that once you’re taking probiotics you may be flushing out what you want to stay in your system?"
8,raster,486,Most of those items are outlines in the protocol and what they do. Fermented cod liver oil reduces inflammation of the gut and reduces biofilms. Miracle fiber is a prebiotic which feeds probiotics and heals the gut. All of these supplements should be taken away from the cleanse. -raster
0,FranzFan,487,"Hi all, I’m taking Oregano oil as an antifungal – around 15 drops daily in 3 doses. I wondered whether it should be diluted when taken or not? I have been diluting doses in a cup of water so far, as I find it burns the throat otherwise, but I wondered whether this negates its effect? The same applies for GSE, which I’m going to start taking. Should this be diluted? Thanks."
1,raster,487,I guess it works either way; I personally take the dose of antifungals and chase it with water right away and taste leaves my mouth within 15 minutes or so. This is likely the same effect as adding it to a glass of water and drinking it. -raster
2,West11,487,"Does the bottle say dilute? I would assume if you should it would, but if it’s anything like some grapefruit seed extracts I would dilute to be safe. I once burned myself really bad with it, it was extremely painful and took 2 weeks to heal. Just be careful. It’s better to play it safe and take it slow, can you link what product you are using? I read you can dilute in virgin olive oil and use a dropper, that could be better than water."
0,FranzFan,488,"Hi there, I have been following the moreless protocol for the last week as a means of trying to alkalise my body and increase the effect of antifungals. I wondered whether anyone believes this, or other alkalising drinks, are effective in tackling candida, or not? Also, if anyone has tried moreless, I wondered whether you should take the blackstrap mollasses that are meant to be part of this drink? Mollases, I believe, are formed from concentrated cane sugar, so I presumed would be a no-no, but I wondered if anyone had had success by including them in any remedy? Thanks"
1,West11,488,"Ideally you want to alkalize your blood and acidify your stomach. Eating greens, apple cider vinegar and taking cayenne pepper supplements can help. I think my body outside my organs is very acidic and my buffers are depleted. Been taking a multi-mineral with iron, cayenne pepper, avc and eating allot of greens. I’ve seen a good break through. I also take B6 which helps PH balance. I didn’t really start seeing big results until I started this. Keep in mind if you take minerals and vitamins you need to be careful, best to take fda approved amount and a find a balanced one that contains everything if you don’t know how much to take. An unbalanced PH is a big contribution to candida over growth, typically an over alkaline stomach which creates a less alkaline level the blood should be."
0,mahdama,489,"Hi all, My nutritionist put me on Candigest pills (i think they are an alternative to anti-fungals.) I was wondering if anyone else has used them and their experience/success stories? http://www.nutricentre.com/p-41044-candigest-plus.aspx Thanks"
1,raster,489,"Candigest contains enzymes which help you gain more energy from the food you eat and helps break down the food in your body. Here are the ingredients: Celluase  Protease  Hemicellulase  Amylase  Invertase  Malt Diastase  Glycoamylase  Magnesium Sterate  Microcrystalline Cellulose I would consider taking something like pro-gest as an alternative, which is the product I use and feel that it is superior.

0,JohnnyPonny,490,Anyone consumed this while on the diet? *JohnnyPonny*
1,Javizy,490,"My bottle arrived today. You need to get organic unpasterised unfiltered with ‘Mother’. It’s the live ‘Mother’ part that contains enzymes that benefit your health. If you do a Google search, you’ll find lots mentioned about its anti-fungal properties and other health benefits, but maybe someone could explain for you."
2,JohnnyPonny,490,Good to hear that. Im going to try and make chicken stock in the futher and the recipe calls for vinegar. So would suck if I could not use it. *JohnnyPonny*
3,YeastMan,490,Did nothing for me except destroy my teeth enamel. Temporarily relieved itching when applied externally.
4,Marbro,490,"I plan on going back ACV after im done with the cleanse. As said already it has to be with the ‘mother’ or its pointless. Also, use a straw when you drink it and wash it down with a glass of water and then brush your teeth. Dont brush your teeth without washing your mouth with water first."
5,kad,490,"From the mouth of a dental hygienist, don’t brush your teeth immediately after consuming something acidic, just rinse! Brushing will cause irreversible damage to the enamel."

Or will it simply delay the recovery process a while longer (say a couple of more weeks?) Anytime you supply food to the Candida during the treatment you’ll set yourself back. How much depends on your specific overgrowth, the amount and types of foods you eat, as well as how many times you cheat. So it’s anybody’s guess as far as how much time you’ll lose on the treatment. It could literally be a few days or a few weeks or even a few months because at this point there’s simply no way of knowing. If you’re going to be eating foods for the Candida, all you can do is continue taking antifungals during the same period of time and hope for the best outcome instead of the worse. I am actually stressing about this a little! Don’t feel alone in your stress; everyone on the forum with a Candida overgrowth is stressing to one degree or another, so you’re in good company. And if you’re only stressing ‘a litte’ you’re among the lucky ones. Able"

I once had risotto after being on the strict diet for 2 weeks. It totally messed me up for a couple of days. The worst is the feeling destroyed part, not the delay of your recovery. A month on the diet, your reactions can be pretty severe. Far more severe than before the diet. So be careful."
3,mazz,492,"I feel your pain. Eating out is the main way that people socialise here in Kuwait (no pubs and not much else to do!), and if I don’t eat out occasionally I don’t get to see my friends. With a lot of perusal of restaurant menus, and a bit of experimenting, I’ve found I can actually get away with eating in a few places. Any French-ish restaurant that serves omelettes is good – I ask them to leave off the bread and any salad dressing. There are also lots of Lebanese and Iranian restaurants here, and from their menus I can eat: shish tawouk (grilled chicken with a spice mixture on it), baba ganoush or mutabal (both aubergine-based dips – not everyone can tolerate aubergine though), any kind of grilled chicken or fish, and any salad without dressing. They also usually serve fresh lemonade with mint, which is literally lemon juice, water, mint and sugar, and as it’s made fresh I tell them to leave out the sugar. Perhaps you could look around for those kinds of restaurants and experiment with a different kind of cuisine for a change? I wouldn’t recommend the pizza/bagel route. The only time I (inadvertently) ate something with sugar in it, after about a month on the diet, I felt awful for a week after. I’d stick with the food restrictions and enjoy your trip to New York, personally!"

Two weeks ago while at my wits end with my constant sickness, I found an article about Candida and had a revelation! After a long time of feeling toxic and knowing in my heart that there was some bigger underlying issue, finally I knew what was wrong with me — Candida! I did the “spit test” and proved myself right. So I gathered my pennies (limited since I’m a student…) and started preparing myself to get this out of my body. So far, my roommates and family have been awfully tempting with their awful pizza, McDonalds, bread, beer, fried food, baking and pop “addictions”. They honestly eat bad things constantly and I’m proud to say I have not cheated one time, not one bite, in my six days on the diet. SO, sorry this is a long one but I want to throw out my symptoms, my process (so far) and my questions. Sorry for TMI. Any help is greatly appreciated. My symptoms (whether connected to Candida or not): — Poor memory, Brain fog, Irritability, Anger, Dizziness, Depression, Crying spells, Panic attacks, Low libido, Persistent extreme fatigue, Cravings for sweets/carbs/alcohol, Insomnia, Headaches — Obesity – and an annoying inability to lose weight!!!!  — Vaginal yeast infections — Lymph node swelling (very extreme for several weeks in the fall)  — Tonsil stones (tonsilloliths) , halitosis — Irregular menstruation (almost absent for 8 years) — Persistent cough, sore throat, chronic post-nasal drip, chronic sinusitis — Allergic reaction or strong symptoms when in the presence of mold — Itchy ears, tinnitus — Acne, skin tags, dandruff, generally poor/dry skin quality Here is what I have done for the past 6 days: Diet:  – NO sugar/substitutes, no dairy (except small amounts of butter), no wheat, yeast or white grains, no high carb veggies, no fungi, no nuts except almonds and walnuts, nothing soy, nothing artificial/processed, no alcohol and caffeine, no fruit (except lemons), nothing with vinegar, no condiments, no pop/juice.  – Coconut oil, olive oil, butter, apple cider vinegar, olives (in water, not vinegar), kefir (daily if possible), nutritional yeast.

Maybe I’m looking for the wrong thing/in the wrong place? Results so far — **I caught a cold from my roommate on Day 2 and took 1000mg of Vitamin C every hour for 8 hours which absolutely helped. I am not sure if the cold was amplified by Die-Off symptoms or not.  — I haven’t had any noticeable die-off symptoms, but I can tell something is “working” inside after I take the CandiGone or Kefir.  — I have had minor headaches, constipation and diarrhea. — My skin has definitely improved. I have not had any acne since I started. — Tons of tonsil stones surfaced at the beginning, which I removed. There haven’t been many since. — My yeast infection symptoms have already lessened quite a bit. — I feel like I have more energy and have been requiring less sleep the last couple days! Here are my questions: – What can I snack on?? I’m going crazy with all the veggies – I have tried roasted chickpeas (they were pretty good but they get dull), kale chips (the flavour didn’t do it for me) and . Can I eat organic corn chips or plain potato chips occasionally? Anything crunchy or sweet to suggest? – Am I doing anything wrong? Anything I’m missing? Is it bad that I’m not experiencing many die-off symptoms? – When can I drink alcohol again? I love love love gin and lemon water… and I feel like it would be the least abrasive alcohol choice to my system. – (my biggest question…) In 2 weeks I will be moving to an extremely rural place in Newfoundland that only gets limited vegetables, and only weekly. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. There is not a chance I’ll be able to find quinoa, coconut oil, kefir, stevia or ANYTHING there.

1,raster,497,The protocol mentions a timeline for introducing antifungals: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx I would switch to a different antifungal if coconut oil causes problems or switch to eating it with meals.

0,Positivo,498,Hey guys For some time I have been taking my probiotics in the morning with water and then having a veggie juice right after. I recently stopped doing that but I wanted to know if it’s ok to drink a veggie juice with probiotics in the morning?
1,princeofsin,498,"This is what I do on even days. I never had a issue regarding this. Although a good probiotic can be very effective in preventing a candida overgrowth in the first place, there is certainly NO evidence to suggest that any probiotic can actually cure candida. A top quality probiotic can be most effective rather than most retail purchased products, which I have found to be therapeutically of little value. Once the candida becomes more widespread in the body you will find that probiotics have little effect unless you use a good eradication product and work hard out on diet modification. It is the combined and consistent effort placed on diet, supplements and lifestyle that will win the day. So continue to juice :)."

0,mari1983,500,"Hi, I’ve been on the candida diet for about 3.5 weeks and am battling bad leaky gut and healing from celiac damage. I’m keeping my daily carb grams to a minimum without being in the rage of falling into ketosis. I’ve been eating a lot of coconut bread, coconut oil, nuts/seeds, etc, vegetables, fish and chicken, on occasion. The trouble is, I’m still losing about 1/2 pound a day.It’s almost like I can’t absorb properly. I have some undigested food in my stool and it’s getting harder for me to stay strong.I’ve dropped from 121 to 108. My muscles tremble badly and I have terrible neuropathy. I’ve been taking slippery elm to work on reducing the inflammation in my leaky gut.I’m wondering if it would be safe to add a ” safe grain,” like quinoa, to help me stop losing so much weight. Would that be safe or would that irritate leaky gut even more?? I have found I had an allergic reaction to eggs with my leaky gut so those are out for the time being. Any suggestions would greatly help. Thank you!"
1,Able900,500,"You definitely need to be treating the leaky gut if you are passing undigested food.

Buckwheat isn’t a grain, so you might try making some bake goods using it. You’ll probably find some recipes on forum. You can also substitute buckwheat for the coconut flour in bread. I see you’ve added coconut oil; how much are you taking at this time? Also how are you incresing the amounts? The oil can definitely help you gain weight or at least stop your weight loss. Able"
2,Positivo,500,I had undigested food passing through my bowels when I got a colon cleanse but not at home with my regular bowel movements. I proved a couple months ago with a l-glutamine product by renew life called the leaky gut solution(it came with probioitics and fiber pills as well) and eating boiled vegetables with animal protein. I lost around 20 lbs in two weeks so I know the feeling. But during a recent colonic the hydrotherapist could not see any undigested food and my diarrhea has improved. I hope this helps you.
3,raster,500,"I feel that you need to chew your food longer so that larger particles don’t make it through your digestive system undigested.

I have a chew your food post on the forum if you want to check it out. I’ve been dealing with this problem throughout my treatment and the main thing that causes it is not chewing my food enough.

This is my third approach and I have had a great start to beating candida- really because this website seems by far the most accurate and has been very informative. So I have been having bad die-off, why is okay- and I have been using all the vitamins except for this swedish bitters. So I went out and bought it today. I ask the lady at my Whole Foods store (just to make sure) if it has alcohol in it. She said no and since the website says that this product predominantly does not, I had a teaspoon. Well, I was reading the back and noticed it says: Water/alcohol extract of …. all these leafs and roots. So I am freaking out!!!! Did I just ruin my cleanse? Would other Swedish Bitters say alcohol percent instead of alcohol extract? Is it the same thing? Please help!!!! Pamie"

0,tennisgirl,502,"Hello, I’m new to this forum and had a couple of questions. I don;t have major side effects, but always have had fatigue, brain fog, red rash that comes and goes, anxiety, and sensitive stomache. Diagnosed with adrenal fatigue due to having a lot of stress dealing with a special needs and sickly child. Since being diagnosed, my naturopathic doctor put me on a gluten free diet, low sugar, and low caffeine diet. Recently I had some allergies test performed to see if I possibly had other allergies, since my daughter has Celiac and is daily intolerant. The results came back with high candida albicans, moderate egg yolk allergy, and mild to bakers yeast, millet, egg whites, papaya, banana, cranberry and pecans. So my question is this. I’m a healthy eater, don’t eat too much processed foods or fast foods. My veggies, chicken, ground beef, rice, corn, and some flours are all organic. My doctor just told me to do a low carb diet and elimate most sugars, but after researching candida, I thought I should do more. I’ve been following the protocol listed for almost 7 days. I’m noticing that I’m starting to get dry mouth and lower back pain. I don’t think it’s dehydration and have taken 5 ounces of coconut water to add some natural electrolytes. I also take multivitamins, but haven’t introducted the probiotics or antifungal just yet. Would it be reasonable to think I’m starting the die off this early? I think it’s possible, since I have always eaten clean for the most part. If so, should I start the probiotics now and what about the antifungal? Please advise when you get a chance. Would love to hear from you. Cristina"
1,princeofsin,502,Generally the symptoms you are describing are caused by a UTI. I would advise you to get yourself checked by a doctor or a OB/GYN as soon as possible.
2,Positivo,502,"I can tell you I experienced lower back pain and dry mouth a week ago and yes die off starts almost right away. My first week or so I developed pink eye, bump on my chest under my skin and a rash on my neck. You should take molybdenum to prevent these from getting too severe and to protect your liver from toxins. It is a bit odd that you haven’t been on antifungals and probiotics so this may not be die off in your situation but it is possible."

0,jslawrenc,504,"I’m a 42 year old male and have had mild insomnia for several years, but about 4 months ago it got drastically worse. I often lay in bed for hours before falling asleep. When it is at its worst, I wake up between 3-4am and feel as if I had no sleep at all & cannot go back to sleep. Everything I’ve tried to improve sleep (herbal & prescription sleep aids) seems to work for only a week or 2 before my body adapts. I have many classic symptoms of Candida my entire adult life (IBS, Acid Reflux, brain fog, sinus infections and headaches, irritability). I tried taking a OTC product called Candex about 6 months ago & couldn’t sleep at all for days until I discontinued. I currently take probiotics that really help my Acid reflux, but they also seem to exacerbate my insomnia issues. I suspect this all may be Candida related – possibly my liver not being able to handle detox? I’ve gone through 2 Doctors so far who seem to have no clue what’s going on as nothing obvious comes up in my blood work. I’m pretty desperate here as It’s really impacting my job & health in general. Has anyone here had issues similar to this? I’m almost afraid to start the Candida diet considering how severe my insomnia is already (afraid to do anything to make my current symptoms worse). Has anyone experienced anything like this?"
1,princeofsin,504,"Hi, if you do the following you can get rid of it in no time. It will require for you to take a trip down your local health food store like whole foods or vitamin shoppe and get the following items: 1. Get organic coconut oil which cost about $5-7 dollars from a health food store and take 2 tablespoons of it every morning. It will help give relief from the inflammation caused by yeast (candida), externally and internally to your body. 2. Get apple cider vinegar RAW. I would recommend the one from a company called braggs which is about $6 dollars. Take 2 tablespoons of it the moment you wake up from bed and before you go to sleep. It helps encourage the growth of healthy bacteria, which in turn minimizes the overgrowth of candida and balances your body’s pH level. 3. Eat lots of leafy Green Veg’s every time you are hungry. Now you have to avoid the following because they will only prolong your infection: -No sugar -No alcohol (alcohol is a sugar) -No wheat -No yeast -No caffeine (Caffeine prompts the liver to dump large doses of sugar into the blood stream) -No preservatives and additives -No refined and processed foods -No moldy foods -No dairy (except yogurt and butter on occasion) Cheese and milk contain lactose (milk sugar) which the yeast will feed on. (some people can do small amounts of cottage cheese) -Low in Carbohydrates These will only feed the candida (yeast) SO AVOID AT ALL COST."
2,raster,504,"I have a pretty chronic insomnia problem and take prescription meds and vitamin supplements to deal with my woes. I am sleeping really good and heavy right now for the first time in years. I take amytryptaline and have used this for about 10 years. All I know is that my insomnia was way worse before I started the diet. I felt like a walking zombie and most people with insomnia knows what this feels like. As I have gone through the diet, my insomnia has improved dramatically and I no longer have any sleepless nights. As far as candida, we won’t know for certain whether you have it over the internet. The only way to know for certain if you have candida is to try the diet, and if you experience die-off symptoms, you likely have candida overgrowth. After about 1-2 months your symptoms should improve considerably (hopefully). It typically gets bad before it gets better. I also would consider trying out acupuncture if you can afford it. They can puncture certain spots that will aid in your sleep. A naturopathic doctor might be able to heal this problem without prescription meds and prescribe you something like melatonin or PS-100 (which is what I take). There are drawbacks to taking melatonin as well, so finding a naturopath who doesn’t prescribe this outright would be best. -raster"

No grains at all, as I noticed if I cut out all grains, even the “allowed” ones, my symptoms improved a lot faster. But now I’m so sick I’m thinking some amaranth or a little brown rice would be the thing to eat first. 3) I’m waiting for my kefir grains to arrive so for now I’m just doing some Jarro probiotics powder. 4) I’ve been afraid to take my anti-fungals on this upset stomach.

3,Able900,506," Yes, the question about coconut oil is, knowing what an important anti-fungal it is, what is the best way to introduce it? Is digestion more efficient a little later in the day so it doesn’t take such a toll?To be honest, I never discovered an easy way the entire time I was taking it. At one point I was taking 16 teaspoons a day of the dreadful stuff, never came close to getting used to the taste. The best way I found was to have a cup of very warm water sitting beside the container of coconut oil. I’d take the teaspoon of oil and follow it immediately with a big swollar of warm water. I’m sure this wouldn’t work for everyone, but it was the best way I found to handle it. Is the lemon part of the problem? I’m just trying to get a good pattern for breakfast. I wouldn’t think that lemon would be the problem, coconut oil is a more likely candidate for causing nausea. If you’re not taking Molybdenum, this could be caused by die-off and the toxins that are generated after using antifungals such as the coconut oil. If you don’t have molybdenum, why not leave the coconut oil alone until you can obtain it? This may not be the cause, but it’s worth a try just in case. Able"

You can’t get rid of the hunger until the Candida population has been reduced to a large degree or unless the treatment is stopped.

Do exercise everyday which can help you to lose weight in an easy way. Why would this person want to lose weight “the easy way” when they’re also going to be losing it the hard way? It’s not like there’s a choice of how to lose weight when a person is on a Candida diet. And the poster also doesn’t need to do exercise, especially if it’s strenuous enough to cause weight loss because … guess what, there’s a Candida infestation to deal with which means the immune system is probably weak in which case there’s the need for more rest, not more exercise. Exercise which is strenuous enough to cause weight loss is for the healthy, not for people with an illness which is accompanied by a weakened immune system.

I aim to be on the strict diet eventually. Currently take 3 tablespoons cocounut oil a day(about 12 teaspoons in uk,i believe). Will start taking oregano oil once i get on the strict diet. A lady told me how she cured her extremely severe dry eye and hair loss through this diet and supplements. Hoping the same will happen for me eventually but i cant see it happening 🙁"

Medical doctors do not believe in it at all. Ill say 1 thing.Generally when i start a low sugar diet my rosacea flares,my eyes get way worse. Gotta be candida i guess.

5,Chlofloso,508,"Hi Anthony, I have no idea if Accutane has anything to do with my Candida infestation, but I did take it in quite a high dose when I was a teenager (about ten years ago). I had quite some side effects then, especially extremely dry skin and eyes. My serious health problems with feeling ill all over and extreme fatigue started two years ago, so I don’t know if there is a connection with Accutane. All I can tell you is that this diet has really helped me a lot already and I recommend it to anyone who has symptoms that could be due to Candida. The funny thing is that the little rest of the acne that I still had has almost completely disappeared now that I’m on the diet. All the best to you Chloë"

Along with balanced diet, right exercises, you must also drink plenty of water. Drinking water provides energy to your body, and as a result of which you can perform more exercises. Drinking water and exercising is good for detoxifying the body and you will achieve a healthy weight. Once you start exercising, you should note down the weight and measurements of your body from time to time. In other words you should be monitoring yourself."
1,Marbro,510,"This is good advice, maybe early on in the diet, like the first two weeks you might want to hold off as your body is dealing with all the candida die off but getting active will improve your life soo much. even if its as simple as going out for a walk every other day. Just push your self a tad bit more each week."

0,teacupmama,511,I am confused as to allowed foods on the candida diet. I think I am being strict and feel I can handle the deprivation then I find that I am eating a forbiden food. For example grains. I switched over to quinoa millet amaranth which some state are actually seeds and are good for cleaning our the colon and brown rice which I rotate. Some of the sites state that no grains whatsoever including the above mentioned grains or seeds. agh! Some state occasional coffee with out milk is ok. I cheat with this on the weekend. Others claim coffee is a definate no no on candida diet. Then yogurt. I eat the plain organic yogurt and seem to be ok some sites state no dairy not even yogurt. I also make kefir of goat milk is that wrong too. I have been hit and miss for years taking antifungals some state are ok some state are dangerous. Also probiotics some are ok some say bifidus is bad. Can I get some straight answers somewhere or is subject to interpretation?
1,iride,511,"Yes! It’s confusing, because every Candida “expert” says different things. There is a very clear “protocol” which is the one advocated on this forum.

So anyway, I am 1 week into the candida diet and i am a little worried about the foods and supplements that i take, so i really need your help. So my diet is pretty much like this: For antifungals: 1 teaspoons coconut oil and garlic. i only take 1 teaspoon since i just started, should i purchase more antifungals or should i just up the dose of coconut oil as you say in the protocol? also i will be taking renewlife ultimate flora 50 billion in about 1 week from now for my probiotics, for my vitamins i have vitamin c and molybdenum for my die offs! my vitamin c is 1000 mg with citrus bioflavonoids and i take it 2 times a day, the same goes with molybdenum. those are my vitamins. And lastly for my food i eat Greek yogurt, brown rice, chicken, beef, some fish, eggs, avocados, spinach, flaxseeds, and some almonds. thats it. Please tell me what i need to eliminate so i can have a better treatment and what i need to add to my diet! Also if i have a leaky gut will vitamin c and molybdenum and the probiotics heal me or they will just pass through my system without doing nothing? THANKS SO MUCH!"

I was already thin and didn’t want to lose anymore.  I started eating a lot of avocado, olive oil and coconut oil. I make a coconut bread once a week and usually have 2 eggs a day. This past week I gained eight pounds!!! Whoa!! OK.. I am OK with where I am at now, but I really don’t want to start packing on the pounds!

Which is depressing… This isn’t that uncommon when the coconut oil and coconut bread is added to the diet. How much of the coconut oil are you taking every day? The smartest thing to do would probably be to add more vegetables and lessen the amount of coconut bread and possibly the oil. It might also be smart to substitute another egg for a slice of the coconut bread now and then. Some people can become almost addicted to the bread which can be a problem. The coconut oil also has a lot of calories, and adding more of the oil was the only way I finally stopped losing weight when I was on the diet. Able"

I realize from reading the website as well as the forum topics that it is not completely necessary to do the Cleanse for the Candida treatment to work, but boy is it worth a wink and a nod (ie, the words “Stage One”) for those of us that are doing it.

9,benc,513,"Luckily all the fats suggested to eat on this diet will get stored as energy to be used latter if needed. So if you do pack it on a bit, just back off for a day or so. Perhaps the Avocado’s, as the Coconut Oil has too many benefits to stop taking. Unless you think you are struggling with adrenal burnout, despite what many suggest it is better for the health of your leptin (hormone that controls your hunger & response to food) & insulin (carb & fat regulating hormone) to eat 3 meals per day, & space meals out by 4-6 hours. Another unfortunate factor is when you get stressed your body stress hormone (cortisol), raises this cannibalizes muscle tissue, which slows your metabolism down, so where possible try and manage the stress (easier said than done, I know). I take rhodiola magnesium vit d3 & omega 3 (fish oil, chia seed oil, hempseed oil), but cinnamon, apple cider vinegar, fenugreek, are all helpful for that too. You might need to check if they are allowed on the diet."
10,thomasmite,513,"As you wrote that you use coconut oil and eat oily foods eggs. It is the way to gain weight quickly. I thing you have to take some rest after eating some things. It is the better way to gain weight and fat. Too much diet reduce essential muscles, weight and body become tinny. Normal body weight is essential for attraction figure. Use fish, chicken, meat, egg etc. It help to gain strong and flexible body."
0,Marbro,514,"I have seen Raster mention Cod Liver Oil as a good anti inflammatory supplement to take. But a lot of store bought CLO is heated and all the good stuff is killed and in they then put in vitamin A and D to it. Kind of like most store bought ACV where the mother is gone. You can still get good CLO from places like Carlsons and they will benfit you but I reccomend you spend a little extra and try fermented Cod liver oil. Benefits of Fermented Cod Liver Oil So we know that fish oil is rich in omega 3 fatty acids, and you can read all about the benefits of omega 3s here. Cod liver oil has the added benefits of being naturally rich in the fat soluble vitamins D and A. As a culture, we are notoriously low in vitamin D which is contributing to numerous problems from weak immune systems to hormone imbalances. (Read more about vitamin D here). The problem is, however, that most fermented cod liver oil is heat treated which destroys much of the naturally occurring vitamins. These cod liver oils have their vitamins A and D added back in. The main issue with this, is that the vitamins A and D are not longer in the proper proportion – leading to risk of possible vitamin A toxicity when taken in large doses. You can read everything you need to know about Vitamin A toxicity here. Enter fermented cod liver oil – Because the oils of FCLO are extracted without heat and preserved through a slow lacto-fermentation, the naturally occurring vitamins and goodness are retained. This is evident by the deep rich color of FCLO as opposed to the pale yellow of conventional cod liver oil. This means that fermented cod liver oil contains the proper ratio of the essential fat soluble vitamins A and D – two nutrients that cannot be obtained through vegetable sources. Futhermore, because FCLO is a fermented food, the body can assimilate its nutrients with more ease and efficacy. Fermented Cod Liver Oil is a Traditional Superfood Here’s an interesting quote in this post by Cheeseslave from Dave Wetzel maker of Green Pasture Fermented Cod Liver Oil: Fish oils have historically been fermented for extraction; back in the Roman empire days, Viking era and all the way up to the Mid 1850′s. Rendering was introduced during the mid 1850′s as a more efficient fish liver processing method. The livers yielded a much higher total oil volume and the process could be accomplished in several hours rather than several months. What they did not understand is the effects that heat had on the nutrients (their science was not ready to address this question). As with all industrial models, the focus was on: profitability, speed or turns and, marketability (taste). In summary, fermented cod liver oil is a traditional super food that is prepared by old-fashioned methods that preserve the maximum nutritional benefit. FCLO provides much needed omega 3s, and vitamin A and D in proper proportions – certainly worth taking on a regular basis http://www.holistickid.com/benefits-of-fermented-cod-liver-oil/ A great source http://www.greenpasture.org/public/Products/CodLiverOil/index.cfm"

2,Marbro,514,princeofsin wrote: That is kind of pricey for my taste. Lol no doubt and I can tell you fist hand it taste like crap. Regular cod liver oil is cheap and still a good source of vitamin A&D. As well as a good anti-iflamatory agent. This Is good for folks who Do not get much sun exposure.
0,benc,515,"For 3 weeks I have been eating foods in the strict diet, and am/have experienced die off. Prior to that I didn’t really eat a high carb diet anyway, but used them around workouts for recovery and the odd cheat meal once or twice per week (which would either be a curry, or include sweet potato). I usually eat berries once or twice a day. Otherwise is was lots of organic or free range meat & eggs, some fish, nuts & seeds & lots of veg. My reason for not wanting to do so is I have a physically job (which involves working all morning & late evening) which I am already really struggling to keep going at, plus a 2 year who I take care off in between work.

0,benc,517,"First of all, thank you to everyone who has replied to my posts & given me advice already. I apologise in advance if I go over stuff already answered. My situation in brief: I work as a personal trainer, have a 2 year old (who I look after in between morning & pm sessions, until my wife gets back from work).  I’ve had recurring labyrinthitis like symptoms 4 times in the last 15 months, which takes a minimum of 3 weeks for me to get back on my feet. Leading up to the attacks i’ve always had stress, diet with more sugar & alcohol than normal & in 2 cases stomach cramps. Doctors have not helped me over my lifetime, giving me too many antibiotics for minor things like chest infections claiming my asthma is the reason I had to take them. I’ve been eating very close to a paleo diet for the past 3-4 years, using sugars/starches only post training or once per week as a treat in general & fruit from berries once a day. I used to drink between 2-4 cups of strong coffee per day (& miss it so much). Anyway, i’ve been using garlic, pau d’arco tea, coconut oil, goldenseal, & echinacea for the past 3-4 weeks, along with a diet consisting of: -Organics meats (beef, buffalo, venison, duck, lamb, sometimes chicken – although I suspect its a problem food for me), organic eggs, fish (wild caught salmon & haddock). -Nuts, Seeds & good fats: brazil, macadamias, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, ground flaxseed, flaxseed oil, avocado, olives, extra virgin organic coconut oil, extra virgin organic olive oil. -Veg: Salad, cauliflower, spinach, swiss chard, red cabbage, kale, bok choy, peppers (all colours), aubergine, courgette, onion, garlic. -Powders: wheatgrass, barleygrass, spirilina, chlorella, unflavoured pea protein, unflavoured brown rice protein isolates (very rarely), unflavoured whey protein isolates (very rarely) -Herbs & Spices: Cinnamon, fenugreek, turmeric, sea salt, pepper, oregano, parsley, cumin & paprika (which I read can be problematic y’day), chicory coffee, liquid stevia (from Now) I cut back on eating nuts & seeds but found I was always hungry & would go to the toilet less, so re-introduced them (although sometimes they cause wind). I would only take one powdered drink per day, to keep my energy levels up when working with clients for long hours in a row. I’ve experienced die off, with the worst visual symptoms being rashes & eczema flare up that meant I couldn’t use my hands for a week, not even to cut up food. I feel so tired for most of the day & if I sleep in the day it doesn’t really refresh me. I’ve been doing epsom salt baths 5-6 days per week, making sure its hot enough to leave me sweating like a sauna If I had the energy I would do the cleanse, but I think it would finish me off, and I have to try to hold together my business whilst looking after a 2 year old in the afternoon. What I would really like to be sure of, is if I am on the right track. I can except its going to take a while, but want to be sure that i’m not doing anything to prolong it? Thanks if you’ve spent the time to read & reply to this, as i’m sure you have all experienced its hard to be sure you are getting it right as you feel so much worse when you start to tackle it."
1,Able900,517,"I can except its going to take a while, but want to be sure that i’m not doing anything to prolong it?That depends on who you talk to on the forum as well as which diet you’re following. If you’re following the diet on the website, then it’s probably “ok.” But if you’re following the “strict” diet, then there are problems with your regimen. For example, wheatgrass powder has a negative effect on your treatment. There’s also a specific protocol on the forum, have you seen it? So which diet are you following? Able"
2,benc,517,"tbh, I mixture of the diets i’ve researched all over the internet. I’ve used this website as the main starting point & added the powders + blended green veg & good fats for convenience, when I don’t have much/any time to sit down & chew food. I always rotate protein, veg & fat sources, usually over 3-4 days. & i’ve started on the molybdenum y’day. I also take 3-4g of vitc per day, 5000ie of vit d3, a multi vit, 3 x b complex, CoQ10, rhodiola, wobenzym, a low dose of HCL, probiotics x 3 per day. 10g of glutamine powder per day too."
3,Marbro,517,If your not having success with the diet you are using hen I highly suggest you give able and raster a email and try thier protocol. It’s a strict serious diet but will starve and attack candida better than what your currently doing. If you take the time to read through it fully and adhere to it then I believe you will be successful.
4,benc,517,"Yes i’ve seen it, but I can’t eat that many eggs or chicken, partly down to the facts that I used to eat them everyday for years & have had to take 3 month breaks from them to address intolerances. I’m currently off chicken, broccoli, & almonds, & I rotate eggs over 3-4 day period. I’m waiting on some test results for food allergies (& my candida blood test results), so will find out more then. Without a relatively high protein, & fat diet I find i’m even more tired than usual. So I eat organic buffalo, organic grass fed beef, venison, lamb, & duck. Currently the antifungals I am taking daily are garlic, coconut oil, pau d’arco, & goldenseal. I eat some sweed y’day & other than a rapid fairly aggressive passing of stool I felt as normal.

I will start to rotate the suggested antifungals from the protocol then. Any other suggestions?"
1,Marbro,521,I can tell you if you are taking anti-fungals and probiotics with a candida infestation you will have die off even if you are feeding it. Have you tried looking at amazon for molybdenum amino acid chelate? Chicken and salmon should be eaten in moderation. Moreover Salmon should be wild caught and fresh. I have had a bad reaction from eating a lot of salmon. But each person is different. Your diet should be mostly greens and veggies on the allowed food list with meat only like 3 times a week. Its hard for me as I have always had meat with 90% of my meals. The almonds should be raw and soaked to insure that no mold is present.
2,shell,521,"Thank you for replying. I have had some troubles with the salmon, chicken and almonds since that last post. I think I need some more fats. I eat one or two avacados a day and put olive oil on all my salads. (which I have two a day) you will see my latest post asking for more suggestions if people have them."
3,raster,521,I agree with what Marbro has stated; you can have die-off without feeling the effects of it. I am sure I still have “die-off” despite being on the diet 9 months. -raster

I don’t know if the symptoms are attributable to something else or whether introducing this cream again is making it worse. It maybe that I have begun washing with tea tree oil and am now taking garlic supplements more recently… I read that symptoms might get worse before getting better…but it’s all a bit confusing to be honest. Please advise. Thank you

I have digestive problems, seasonal eczema and dermatitis, and acne problem, this is why i wanted to try this detox, other than that i have no severe problems. I do the OPTION 2: COLON CLEANSE Her is how I went through: Day before, i got a colonic irrigation Day 1: was fine,  Day 2: I couldn’t wake up, was not able to stay standing, i had cold, trembling and felt very dehydrated, i slept long time and i felt ok afterward, was just dizzy and had lack of prudence. Day 3: I did vomit the whole detox drink with the vitamines, later i did prepare another one, my body has accepted this time, now it’s ok. but i feel weak in my muscles. My joints feel dryer. I’m a vegeterian and do a lot of exercise due to my job, and if not canbonyhdrates, at lest I need protein. This evening i am planning to have another colonic irrigation and convert to the safe diet. I will add the sweedish bitters too to my cleansing, how about it? @able900 and raster  BUT, there is an important issue and I need your advice at some point, I can not find MOLYBDENUM in my country, not even spoken on web… I live outside of US and Europe, ordering online will take a long time, besides i use no CC.

1,Able900,526,"Welcome to the forum, Rena.This evening i am planning to have another colonic irrigation and convert to the safe diet. I will add the sweedish bitters too to my cleansing, how about it?I can’t comment on the colonic irrigation as I’m not a fan of this procedure, but you’re sure to find a few huge supporters on the forum. Swedish bitters are a good idea.there is an important issue and I need your advice at some point, I cannot find MOLYBDENUM in my country, not even spoken on web… I live outside of US and Europe, ordering online will take a long time, besides i use no CC. What could substitute MOLYBDENUM? A lot of people in other areas including Europe and South American sometimes have problems finding the products that are so convenient here in the US. For die-off symptoms the following can be helpful; Ecklonia cava is an extract which is derived from sea weed. It’s a potent anti-oxidant which in studies exhibits a stronger effect than other antioxidants. In addition to this, alpha lipoic acid (ALA), n-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and glutathione can help. Of course, that’s providing you’re able to obtain any of these. A few things to do every day to help remove the die-off toxins are: Add Epsom Salts to your bath water while soaking, and be sure to keep the water  very hot during the entire soak. I’m sure you can obtain some detox teas; below is a link leading to information on some of the best teas for detoxing. If you can, obtain a few of these and drink as many cups as you can manage during the day to help detox the aldehydes. Remember that the Candida toxins are not just bothersome when they’re causing die-off symptoms; they’re also potentially dangerous to your body in general, so it’s imperative that you do everything possible to remove them from your body.  As you see, the objective is to keep them moving out of your body in whatever way possible. Drink a LOT of water during the die-off period, even more than during the diet, and don’t allow yourself to become constipated. If all else fails as far as making you feel less of the die-off effects, read the post below and try some of the ideas to keep the toxins moving. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1098_Constipation-Remedies.aspx Let us know if you have other questions as well as whether or not these suggestions are able to lessen the effect of die-off.

I have a several statements and some more questions: Today is my 4th day, Able I did a colonic irrigation yesterday because I was constipated for 3 days since the start of the Opt 2 diet, then i switched the safer diet that you prosoped under another topic.  With the added greens eggs and lemon I feel great, very energic and light today, muscle weakness is leaving off, my skin is very even and light looking, though i did not have active sebum or dermatitis plaques nowadays, now it looks smoother, brighter and healtier, maybe because of so much water, brushing and oil pulling effects? My questions: 1- The 2nd and 3rd days were tough, draining, might that have been the die off ? Or how do i feel such good now?, such quickly, no die off yet? 2- Is yogurt or kefir allowed during the cleansing, since i live in a natural yogurt and kefir heaven? 3- Is coconut milk allowed during the cleansing 4- Actually, this safer diet includes the strict diet list’s food or the cleansing diet’s foods? Accordingly are the wild rices and oat brans allowed? (I am more than happy with cleansing’s list by the way) 5- When should I introduce the probiotics and antifungals in order?

The 3rd day I had aches in my leg muscles and my tendons,sore back muscles(this could be of chiropractic adjustment too) I did vomit, then felt better again but in the evening got drained again. This 1st 3 days I sticked to the cleansing opt 2 very strictly. Well now, will this die off period last and reoccure time to time or this is jut for once?

0,sacmde,527,Sensitive Skin I have been on this diet for 12 days now (the strict food diet-no fruit). Already had Die off symptoms. I noticed that my skin was very sensitive today (NO RASH). When I put the usual Loreal face cream on my face it felt irritated. Also when I put on a clean long sleeve T shirt today my skin felt itchy and irritated. Do people usually develop sensitive skin while on this diet? Am I going to have to change my laundry detergent and make up from now on? Please help!
1,Able900,527, Does your cream contain alcohol? This is probably just a reaction from the healing effect that the diet has on the infestation and some of the die-off symptoms as well. Are you doing anything to combat the toxins and die-off symptoms? Able
2,sacmde,527,Thanks Able! I am also working out at the gym and sitting in the dry sauna to sweat the yeast out of my pores. Drinking lots of water (boil it first). Today my skin is not as itchy.

Then I thought maybe it’s my dog (who is a hypoallergenci breed plus I shouldn’t blame the poor thing because i was itchy way before he came along). Does anyone have any recommendations on products to bathe with? Are there any soap-free products you’ve used? Creams, oils? I try not to take hot showers because it makes it worse but I LOVE a hot shower! I don’t use the typical soaps on the market. I’ve tried olive oil soap from a health food store, Cetaphil, Burt’s Bees and dozens of after bath lotions, potions and more and I still suffer. I even have scars on my legs from the scratching. It’s horrible! Talking about it makes me want to scratch! Also, my scalp is itchy and I use mild shampoos with no bad products. Anyone have any suggestions? Thnx! GB"

Thats your body’s way of telling you that something is wrong, your body is not agreeing with something that your eating which most of the time is something dairy. By the way, I Also recommend that you start taking in more fiber.  I take a fiber powder 2-3 scoops a day which roughs out to about 15 grams of fiber alone from the powder, then I get more fiber from cauliflower, whole grains and oatmeal."

Regardless if other people tell you that your allowed to eat eggs, I wouldnt  listen to them at all about that. Hi, Acer, I am confused by your advice about no dairy. Milk, yogurt, cheese, cream are dairy products. Eggs are not a dairy product. It’s a protein, it’s just not a meat protein. So, when you say not to eat dairy, eggs do not fall into that category. Although, eggs may be a cause of gas for some, keep in mind that each person’s symptoms vary. Eggs (though I’m allergic) do not cause stomach issues for me. Positivo, I would advise experimenting with elimination of foods that seem to be causing symptoms (and reintroducing at a later stage if it’s on the safe food list for that stage). Some people in the forum have talked about chicken causing bloating. I’ve found helpful information reading through the forums. I would like to see what the experts advise."
4,Javizy,529,"Eggs certainly are not dairy, and I wouldn’t take Positivo up on his guarantee. The whole world isn’t sensitive to dairy, i.e. milk products, and different people tolerate and react to different foods. It’s worth temporarily avoiding anything that might be causing you symptoms, though, and then reintroducing it to confirm its safety. The thing that caught my eye is all the fermentable fibre in vegetables like Brussel sprouts and broccoli and the buckwheat. If you have a low tolerance to this kind of fibre, an excess of it will lead to the bloating and constipation symptoms you’re experiencing. Did you include many prebiotic foods prior to beginning the diet? Fibre of any kind needs to be introduced slowly as tolerated. I feel like I’ve wasted a lot of time playing wait-and-see with my bloating, so I encourage you to experiment sooner rather than later to try and find out what’s causing it. Nothing is off-limits – citrus, lettuce, asparagus, buckwheat, eggs, fish – anything can potentially cause you problems if your body reacts to it."
5,raster,529,"I recommend trying out the vitamin called zypan. I believe it contains lactose, but don’t worry about that because it is in small quantities. Zypan can completely eliminate problems related to gas, I’ve been using it for a few months now and don’t have any more gas. -raster"
6,Positivo,529,"Thanks to everyone for the advice. I didn’t have eggs today but I had buckwheat and Swedish bitters as directed by able and I feel great today.

I might avoid eggs for a bit because I feel like I have eaten them excessively over the past couple months. Thank you guys. Ill try zypan if I don’t see results. Thanks raster for the advice."
7,jereseib,529,I’m going to agree with the others on this topic. Eggs are certainly not a dairy product. They are protein with some fat and cholesterol. I doubt that eggs alone would cause your gas.
8,Able900,529,"Hi, Guys.  Dairy is the white liquid or anything made from the liquid produced by the mammary glands of mammals. I don’t think this description includes eggs. Eggs can cause gas and bloating, just like all proteins can. Taking Betaine hydrochloride with pepsin can help along with Raster’s Zypan."
9,Positivo,529,"Hi Able, I decided to cut eggs out and eat oat bran and cream of buckwheat for a while. I might have developed an allergic reaction to it. Not sure but I ve been using the Swedish bitters with all my meals and it works wonders. I have to say I had 6 eggs yesterday with the bitters and I had diarrhea an hr after meal so it could have been the eggs but the bitters with every other meal eliminates my gas. I also added more anti fungals. (black walnut, garlic, pau d arco, and oil of oregano.). At this point I am not feeling much of any die off and I am approaching 5 weeks. I hope this is a good sign and I’m not being deceived by my body. Anyways thanks to all and I’m going to remain positive, I hope you all do the same."

Does anyone have any suggestions? Just to be clear you are not eating “minus the fruit, nuts & post workout carbs, which were often 40g maltodextrin & 40g whey 4-5 x per week”? It can take up to 6 months before you see results depending on how bad the overgrowth is. Have you been testing for food allergies? Eczema is a very common by product of allergies. What kind of Eczema do you have? Eating the two of the biggest allergens Cow & Gluten are closely tied to Eczema. Are you familiar with “The Protocol” on this forum? what probiotics are you taking? is the only anti fungal that your taking “Now Candida Clear” if so you need to add in Virgin Coconut Oil.

My doc suggested I needed to go back on the steroid cream & also thinks I need a course of oral antibiotics, as he is worried there may be a bacterial infection. I’ve been on the diet for nearly 3 weeks now, which is actually not too far away from how I was eating anyway (minus the fruit, nuts & post workout carbs, which were often 40g maltodextrin & 40g whey 4-5 x per week). I am seeing a herbalist who told me to stop taking Now Candida Clear & switch to the herbal infusion that will ease the die off, which I started today. She has made some suggestions but also said that I might have to take them if it gets any worse. I’m concerned that if I ignore the doc the eczema or bacteria will spread even further (its gone onto my feet & a bit on my stomach), but since i’ve been doing this I notice the constant dizzi spells that were ruining my life for 15months have gone. Does anyone have any suggestions? Just to be clear you are not eating “minus the fruit, nuts & post workout carbs, which were often 40g maltodextrin & 40g whey 4-5 x per week”? It can take up to 6 months before you see results depending on how bad the overgrowth is. Have you been testing for food allergies? Eczema is a very common by product of allergies. What kind of Eczema do you have? Eating the two of the biggest allergens Cow & Gluten are closely tied to Eczema. Are you familiar with “The Protocol” on this forum? what probiotics are you taking? is the only anti fungal that your taking “Now Candida Clear” if so you need to add in Virgin Coconut Oil.

No i’ve cut all suagr out now.  I eat only organic meat, eggs, veg, nuts, seeds, olives, avocado & post workout organic pea protein isolates with chlorella, spirulina, wheatgrass, barleygrass, chicory coffee (& sometimes flaxseeds).  I take a probiotic from a company in the uk called myprotein & have been for over 6 months. I also take multi vit, vit d3, vit c, b complex, zinc, magnesium, CoQ10, & sometime 5htp & Wobenzym. I use branch chain amino acids & also take glutamine (the latter mainly for my stomach) I had been using coconut oil for sometime now. I’ve increased my garlic consumption. I’ve genrally eaten a paleo diet for 3 years, with a cheat meal once per week. But I used to chew gum, with aspartame in it everyday, plus i’ve had a fair amount of antibiotics for ear trouble & chest infections (when I was younger). If I had known what I know now, I would have asked the question “what else is there?” I’m having a FACT test & blood profile for Candida on fri, because the test the docs did only showed up my kidney profile wasn’t optimal. The doc suggested I was dehydrated, which was the same the last time they tested. The NHS in the uk doesn’t recognise candida or leaky gut, so whilst my doctor is a bit better than other in the practise he can’t test me that. I can accept having die off because I’m getting much less drunk sensations, although i’ve had some days where I felt so horrendous, like I had been drugged. But because I work in a gym I worry that I will pick up infections from open weeping skin which pretty much covers the whole of one palm. I had an epsom salt bath, which helped a bit. I was going to try the same with apple cider vinegar tonight also. I had used the sauna, but its a bit of a double edge sword when you have eczema as you are told to keep it clean & dry."

5,blakek89,530,"You seem to be on the right track. I would ditch the protein shake for a while and consider reducing working out unless it is very light, your body is going through enough trouble detoxing and does not need the extra strain. I would also drop eating nuts and seeds for a while. Until your symptoms start to subside you shouldn’t eat anything that could delay or set back your recovery. What Anti-Fungals are you taking and what dosage?"
6,benc,530,"1st week I took just pau d arco tea (2-3 bags per day) 2nd week I started taking Candida Clear 2 caps twice per day (this is when my die off intensified) & still drinking the tea Now, i’m taking a herbal mix from the herbalist I am seeing (Other than Goldenseal I forgot what was in it, will find out tommorow), also still on the tea but cut it out today. Many thanks for your advice."

Many thanks for your advice. Excellent sources of anti fungals are virgin coconut oil, whole garlic crushed, oregano oil, grapefruit seed extract, caprylic acid capsules/oil, the vegetable rutabaga, and thyme oil. Digestive bitters that are alcohol free will speed up your intestinal repair and will help you reach a cure faster. Eating whole food anti fungals will not need to be rotated but the supplements if you choose to take them will be and at 2 week intervals."

0,rallygirl,532,"Hello all. This is my second post here. I would love for my second post to have been a glowing update or good report but unfortunately I had a major downfall yesterday/today. I broke the diet with sugar–twice–and my body is reacting against it pretty strongly. Yesterday I ate plain yogurt (no sugar as far as the label said) for the first time in a little over a week and I had a bad stomach ache/was bloated/felt like I had a cramp for the entire day. I felt so defeated by the end of the day that I also ate a brownie made from carob flour which only added to the sick feeling–so it could have been the combination of the two that caused intense stomach pains. I didn’t vomit eventhough I felt like I had to for awhile. A glutton for punishment, today I came back for more. I decided to give into my craving for ENERGY (it’s not totally about the sweetness..I need something to wake me up!) and made a lemon cake with all safe ingredients except for coconut milk (and also stevia for the first time since I started the diet). Could this have also made me sick? I didn’t feel too well after eating them. I had one for lunch later this afternoon and I didn’t have a reaction though. A few hours ago someone came to my house with treats and I ate five chocolate cookies (I know I’m INSANE!). After eating two chocolate cookies my tongue started itching and I started sneezing repeatedly–as if I were allergic to it (I’ve never experienced that before). Cramping, stomach pain, itchiness…I’m sure all of this is candida related but I feel like I’m just going crazy. What I want to know is, if I stop the madness now (if this is how it’s going to be from now on NO MORE SUGAR EVER I SWEAR) will my body get better or have I done a lot of damage and need to detox again a bit? Note that I’m not taking any anti-fungals besides adding lemon, garlic and coconut oil in my food as much as I can. I have chicken twice a week–on my busiest days so I can get through it, though lately this hasn’t been enough. Otherwise I only eat eggs, veggies and buckwheat bread. I’m also taking Vitamin C. I haven’t started any probiotics because honestly I haven’t been able to find any—I’m living in a foreign country right now and I’m not sure the best place to find these resources. I’m really confused as to what’s going on with my body right now. After I switched to stage 1 of the diet I was feeling great. I was able to exercise, I had crazy amounts of energy, felt healthier than ever etc etc Since the start of this week everything has been going downhill. I have very low energy, my body aches constantly, my symptoms from another health issue are acting up, I can’t sleep and I’m constantly hungry (I guess this is par for the course on the diet). Are these just die off symptoms that have randomly started to appear or am I doing something wrong? I just can’t believe my body is having such a violent reaction when honestly I’m not even fighting the candida that hard. Suddenly I wish I wouldn’t have started this diet at this time in my life because right now it’s causing more problems that I experienced BEFORE I went on the diet 🙁 Anyway, sorry for complaining, thanks for listening and thanks for any advice. I know what I need to do to make this problem go away…I’m just feeling like I’m not equipped to do it right now. And my body reacting this way is making both choices hard."
1,rallygirl,532,Also does anyone know of any safe herb I can use to help me last through the day? I’m in serious need of energy. I work and travel around a lot during the day. Not being able to sleep on top of zero battery charge is KILLING me. I have milk thistle for digestion problems but I don’t and won’t have any access to molybdenum.

Detoxing for a few days would speed up the recovery from the sugar, but it’s not absolutely necessary in order to eventually reach a cure. But what you need to do is something you already know. Go back on the diet and don’t waste time lengthening the treatment’s time period by eating foods you know you shouldn’t – because now you know the result of doing that. And of course your body can be well and healthy again, as long as you follow the protocol and diet.I’m really confused as to what’s going on with my body right now.

Are these just die off symptoms that have randomly started to appear or am I doing something wrong?The diet can cause severe die-off symptoms if you doing basically nothing to counter the effects (and I do understand this is not totally your fault).  What’s the dosage suggestion of the milk thistle? Are you taking a regular sauna and/or soaking in a tub of hot water every day for as long as possible? The milk thistle and hot tub soaks can both help to lessen the die-off effects, but you’ll have to do the saunas or soaks every single day.Also does anyone know of any safe herb I can use to help me last through the day? I’m in serious need of energy. I work and travel around a lot during the day. Not being able to sleep on top of zero battery charge is KILLING me.See if you can find and obtain an herb called Ashwagandha. If you’re able to obtain it, let me know what the dosage on the container is, and I’ll let you know if you can take more than the amount stated. Lack of sleep makes everything else worse, plus it makes you tired, and this herb should help you sleep as well as improve your mood and depression if that’s a problem; it also improves your stamina.I have milk thistle for digestion problems but I don’t and won’t have any access to molybdenumFor die-off symptoms the following can be helpful. Ecklonia cava is an extract which is derived from sea weed. It’s a potent anti-oxidant which in studies exhibits a stronger effect than other antioxidants. In addition to this, alpha lipoic acid (ALA), n-acetyl cysteine (NAC), and glutathione can help. Of course, that’s providing you’re able to obtain any of these. You wrote that this is only your second post on the forum; perhaps if you post questions and concerns as well as the feelings and problems you experience as you’re having them more often this would help you. Also if you just want to vent … or yell at us if you need to. We’ll listen. Just talk to us. Able"
3,rallygirl,532,"Hi Able..thanks for the response. You’re right…I really need to knuckle down and take care of this thing. Stop being such a baby about it…sheesh 😛 The worst thing is that those cookies SUCKED! I mean if I’m going to eat my last cookie for who knows how long it could have at least been good. Anyway, in response to your questions..What’s the dosage suggestion of the milk thistle? I’m not sure. I found the seeds here and have been making my own tea based on a recipe I searched for on the web. The tea contains 1 tbsp of the seeds. The site recommends drinking a cup 30 min before each meal and one before bed and then after three days taking 3 cups a day. I started doing that (well to be honest I just did the 3 cups a day because I can’t make milk thistle tea at work) but then I didn’t have any symptoms anymore so I stopped. Guess I should start again. It also said to add peppermint seeds to make it more effective against liver issues..do you agree with that? Here is the site btw: http://www.ehow.com/how_7103067_prepare-milk-thistle.htmlAre you taking a regular sauna and/or soaking in a tub of hot water every day for as long as possible? No I haven’t but I’m going to start doing the baths. Does the hot water/cold water switch off thing in the shower (that the site recommends) also work?See if you can find and obtain an herb called Ashwagandha. If you’re able to obtain it, let me know what the dosage on the container is, and I’ll let you know if you can take more than the amount stated. It’s possible that I can find it here but probably not in capsule form (just like the milk thistle). I’ll do some research because there are some “natural” food stores here that sell a lot of herbs and sometimes also carry the capsule or tinture versions. I’ll also be on the look out for the other extracts you mentioned but I feel my safest bet is locating the herbs. I will also try to be better about posting questions. I feel sort of lame to post the same questions as everyone else…but I guess part of the forum is to be able to relieve stress. So I will post more often..though I must warn you, be careful what you wish for! I’ve also started a food blog where I also document my progress and I think that will help me too. Thanks again for all your advice!"
4,rallygirl,532,"Ok I’m back from a citywide search for the herbs/extracts you told me. Unfortunately I had no success. No one recognized it by its native name or by the translation I found for it in Spanish. I have one more place that I can look but won’t be able to until Monday…it’s an Indian food store and I hope they’re at least familiar with it. I wanted to get your opinion on some other supplements I found. None of them contained sugars or gluten. One is called Davitamon. It has 12 vitamins plus ginseng, guarana, zinc and probiotics (2 million count) and other minerals. I know guarana naturally has caffeine in it but not sure if it would be detrimental if it’s taken with other things. Another supplement called Energinat has guarana, ginseng and magnesium. Lastly, I found some capsules of korean red ginseng that is supposed to help with energy and mental fatigue. I suppose if I can’t find anything I’ll just have to suffer for awhile..the milk thistle isn’t helping me that much. I normally only note the difference for about an hour after I take it. I know there is no official timeline for candida and its affects but die-off usually lasts for about 1-2 weeks right? Or in some cases does it last for a really long time? Anyway, please get back to me about what you think of these. Thanks!"
5,Able900,532,"Davitamon. EnerginatPersonally, I wouldn’t waste my money on either of these products, but if you want to try them, that’s up to you as there may possbly be some slight benefit.I know guarana naturally has caffeine in it but not sure if it would be detrimental if it’s taken with other things.Caffeine isn’t going to help anything and is a potential problem. As far as the die-off symptoms are concerned; if you can obtain Epsom Salts put this in your bath water while soaking. Surely you can obtain detox teas in Argentina; below is a link leading to information on some of the best teas for detoxing. If you can, obtain a few of these and drink as many cups as you can manage during the day to help detox the aldehydes. Remember that the Candida toxins are not just bothersome when they’re causing die-off symptoms; they’re also potentially dangerous to your body in general, so please do everything possible to make them as mild as possible. Let us know if you have other questions.  Able"
6,rallygirl,532,"Yes, I have seen some detox teas around. I wasn’t sure if they would help me or not. Also I didn’t see the link below. Could you post it again? Thanks! OH..and one more question. I found some yogurt that’s plain with no added sugar. I know it probably doesn’t have a lot of probiotics (or a large count rather) but is it ok to start with?"
7,Able900,532,Detox teas: http://voices.yahoo.com/the-top-detox-teas-using-herbal-teas-during-detoxification-122194.html?cat=5 Are you talking about the yogurt that you described? “Yesterday I ate plain yogurt (no sugar as far as the label said) for the first time in a little over a week and I had a bad stomach ache/was bloated/felt like I had a cramp for the entire day.” The yogurt probably isn’t going to help much as most regular commercial yogurts aren’t fermented long enough to contain substantial amounts of beneficial bacteria. If you can find Plain Organic Greek Yogurt you’re more likely to obtain a few of the beneficial bacteria. Able
8,rallygirl,532,"Yes, that’s the one. I’m on the look out for good greek yogurt. The only brand I can find has sugar and doesn’t say exactly how much. I will try to introduce it slowly this time since last time I ate the whole thing in one sitting and it wasn’t a good experience (didn’t pay attention to the slow intro of probiotics talk). One more question of the night: chicory root. I found it today and remember hearing that it can substitute coffee. I’m not a huge coffee drinker so I’m not dying for it or anything but I’ve read that it has some good properties that help with digestion and liver issues (I’m sort of worried about my liver now 🙁 poor thing). Is it ok at this stage or is it a possible trigger of some sort? Thanks for answering so many questions!"
9,rallygirl,532,Never mind I just saw that it is on the ok list for stage 1 (at least according to the website).
10,rallygirl,532,Well…I have another question now (ugh). I just violently threw up all of the chicken that I ate a few hours ago (not to be graphic but by the end I was basically dry heaving). Do you think my body has turned against chicken or it has more to do with the fact that I only waited 45 minutes after devouring half a chicken to start exercising (it was a pretty extensive exercise..I broke a sweat and everything)? Does die-off make you more intolerant to certain types of foods? I haven’t thrown up like that since I got alcohol poisoned in college…wow… My symptoms keep getting worse. I hope vomitting will not be a regular part of die-off 🙁
11,rallygirl,532,Woke up feeling awful. Ate some buckwheat bread (to have enough energy to clean my apartment) and my stomach immediately started to twist into knots. I’m miserable. What am I supposed to do if I can’t eat ANYTHING? I’ve had 2 cups of milk thistle tea. Now I’m going to drink chammomile and some ginger tea. I love how everything was pretty good up until 3 days ago…now my boyfriend comes back from his vacation and he’s going to find me crying/heaving/having a panic attack in the bathroom. I hate my body right now. I swear if this continues for another 48 hours FORGET IT. I felt much better with candida than I do “without” it (sorry this is exaggerated but I’m really upset right now).
12,rallygirl,532,Ok I’ve just finished vom session 2 and I’ve calmed down a lot. I’m a bit more clear headed now as well. I should add that an additional culprit could be that I think my buckwheat bread could have gone bad (how long does buckwheat bread keep outside of the fridge? I made it a week ago and now I notice it has a weird sort of smell…then again it’s buckwheat with turmeric..it never smelled that great to begin with ;)). What do you guys think of a full on fast for the next 48 hours? Just lemon water and tea. I don’t want to weaken my immune system but I don’t want to develop a complex from not being able to keep anything down. Are there any veggies that are easy on the stomach? I have a lot of spinach in the fridge. Maybe I’ll try that. Sorry for the outburst in my last post 🙁 Roller coaster ride of emotions over here.
13,Pattinoo,532,"Hi. I’m completing week 4 and 2 weeks were the cleanse. Day 3 of the cleanse I vomited violently. Then had food aversion for about a week to week and half. 2 of the days I was unable to Eat much, one day 2 hard boiled egg whites and next day 2 hard boiled eggs. I was worried but it passed. The not eating was Not by choice but because I felt off and aversive to everything else. Was intense die off for me. Did you get Molybdneum? I think it’s critical with severe die off. Everything I’ve read by and asked of the experts on this site was extremely useful and got me through the toughest times. I’d ask and be reassured that what I was experiencing was normal or was directed to a good solution. Keep asking and hang in there!"
14,rallygirl,532,Hi Pattinoo. Thanks your response and the encouragement. Glad I’m not the only one having a tough time with food reactions (though sorry you also had to go through it). I got so desperate the other day that I decided to fix myself a bowl of quinoa. I felt a lot better afterwards and actually held it down. Now my question is..I know quinoa has been a hot topic at times. Is it going to feed my candida or is it safe? I haven’t had a negative reaction but of course that doesn’t mean that it’s really safe. Advice?
0,KennyG,533,I think I have watched every video there is on YouTube about candida. This video is the best one. Dr Whiting has 25+ years experience dealing with candida yeast. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubZlrZhir6o What do you all think?
0,Candid N,534,"My earliest recollection of symptoms is 1985, after surgery. It’s possible it started before that. I’ve eaten healthfully for 25 years (avoiding dairy, sodium, fried, fat, processed, greasy, breaded, and sugary foods). Started organics ~10 years ago. Food allergies/restrictions have increased over time. Reintroducing foods causes reactions like swollen lids, runny nose, itchy eyes, lethargy, dry skin, bloating… (I have almost every candida symptom (if not all), by the way). Here’s where the diet frustration comes in. KNOWN allergies: Beef, eggs, whey, dairy, green and kidney beans, almonds, malt, yeast, carrots, cabbage… Nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, peppers, white potatoes, eggplant) cause inflammation. Broccoli, spinach, kale, brussels sprouts, soy, sea vegetables…are thyroid suppressing for Hashimoto’s. My Dr. said I can eat 1 portion a day and be ok. Add the candida restrictions: (no grains, sugar, dairy—allergic, anyway, vinegar…) and I’m left with the following proteins: organic/antibiotic free – salmon, chicken, and turkey burgers. Unprocessed, sliced turkey labeled “not administered antibiotics” (as opposed to “not fed”) is impossible to find. The vegetables I’ve been mostly restricted to (sometimes unavailable) are artichokes, cucumbers, celery, beet greens. My staples were sweet potatoes, yams, squash, avocados (I don’t like zucchini much), but I’m restricted from those with the candida diet for at least a while longer. I also read an article http://www.fredericpatenaude.com/articles/candida.html which says that the real issue in candida is fat, not sugar, and to avoid (my staples) avocados and pumpkin seeds. Breakfast is challenging with an egg allergy and no grains(even quinoa causes my overgrowth) and eating other proteins becomes expensive and repetitious. Cravings: I don’t have crunchy, creamy, or sweet snacks to satisfy me, now, and get bored of celery. So I eat sunflower seed butter (too oily and bad for my liver), pumpkin seeds, taro chips (bloat me and cause heartburn even with HCL), goat yogurt (bloats me) — all in excess. I can’t find an HCL refill with no gelatin (beef allergy), porcine or magnesium stearate. (Does anyone know whether people allergic to beef (bovine) tend to also be allergic to pork (porcine)?) I’ve been doing the strict candida diet for about 5 weeks, now; feeling very fatigued nearly every day since adding pau de arco 2x day, milk thistle to 3x day, drinking detox tea/dandelion tea. Weight I’m gaining by binging due to few satisfying choices is bringing me down. The last 2 days I’ve been shaky. However, yesterday was the first time I didn’t feel the need for a nap. Does this indicate die off curtailing? I really need one on one help to know what I need to/can do to successfully turn around my symptoms. Though I prequalified my naturopath for treatment (asked if she was experienced), she is a newbie, and takes up to 2 weeks to respond to my messages. I’d asked close to a week ago (since I cheated on my birthday last month and partook in sweets) whether I could reintroduce sweet potatoes for more options (since I’ve been having supermarket meltdowns). No reply, yet. I live in the Denver area. Posting on this site feels like my last resort. I don’t want to give up. I want to conquer. I thank you, in advance, for your help! I guess what I’m looking for most of all are food suggestions based on the restrictions I’ve listed."
1,Able900,534,"Hello, Candi, welcome to the forum. I obtained this comment from the website to which you referred: “To conclude, the advice I give to people who ask me about candida is to go on a really low-fat diet for a while, avoiding all oil, nuts and avocado.” All I can answer to that is, I cured my Candida infestation while eating two avocados a day, using lots of olive oil in baking a new loaf of coconut bread every few days, taking lots of oil of oregano, and taking up to 16 teaspoons of coconut oil every day for over a month; all of this was done during the period that the infestation was being cured. Nuts and seeds should be avoided because of the possibility of mold, not because of the oils. The bloating comes indirectly from the fact that you have a Candida overgrowth, not specifically the food. As the population of the Candida drops, this symptoms will occur less often. This is the protocol that people on the forum are using. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx An index of posts: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm9960_Index-of-Posts.aspx#post9960 Let us know if you have other questions.

2,Javizy,534,"That site came up before. The article contains a lot of inaccurate information about nutrition and science in general, and seems to be more of an advertisement than an information source. He claims it can resolve candida in a few days, yet nobody having done a fast or vegetable cleanse has experienced such miraculous results. How many of the countless women who mistakenly believe a low-fat diet will help them lose weight also happen to cure their thrush by the time they fit into their size 8 dress?"
0,Acer,535,"Hey I am wondering if anyone knows why I still have white thrush on my tongue after 3 months of strictly going on the candida diet? I was told once the white thrush on the tongue disappears, then I can start taking probiotics to fill my intestines with good healthy bacteria, because that is when the Candida overgrowth will be weak enough to overpower. I have been drinking over 10 glasses of water a day, with lots of fresh vegetables everyday ( cauliflower, broccoli, raw onions and garlic ) along with flaxseeds, ground cayenne, Coillodal Silver and Olive Leaf Extract capsules. I been taking the Olive Leaf Extract capsules for the first month, then switched it to Grapefruit Seed Extract, then for the 3rd month switched it to Candida Organika Pills. I have followed this diet 100% strictly for 3 months and STILL have white thrush on my tongue, does anyone know why? Its really bothering me as I cant figure it out!! Any help would be great! Thanks. Edit: Oh yea I also have cleansed all heavy metals out of my body. I payed some good money to get some good blood tests done, and the results were great! So I know for a fact that heavy metals is not the cause of this."

3,Able900,535,"Hey I am wondering if anyone knows why I still have white thrush on my tongue after 3 months of strictly going on the candida diet?If you’re sure that you have a Candida infestation, then chances are good that it’s the Candida causing thrush in your mouth.I was told once the white thrush on the tongue disappears, then I can start taking probiotics to fill my intestines with good healthy bacteria, because that is when the Candida overgrowth will be weak enough to overpower. But it’ll dissapear if you treat it correctly, obviously, not if you don’t. Why would you wait until the trush is gone to start the probiotics when this is something that helps to elimitate it? You should have been taking probiotics over two months ago.I have been drinking over 10 glasses of water a day, with lots of fresh vegetables everyday ( cauliflower, broccoli, raw onions and garlic ) along with flaxseeds, ground cayenne, Coillodal Silver and Olive Leaf Extract capsules. I been taking the Olive Leaf Extract capsules for the first month, then switched it to Grapefruit Seed Extract, then for the 3rd month switched it to Candida Organika Pills.Try coconut oil, up to 15 teaspoons a day, but start slow with 1 or 2 teaspoons and work your way up. You really should be taking liquid oregano oil instead of olive oil which is a rather weak antifungal. If you take oregano oil, olive oil, and grapefruit seed extract, you should alternate them every two weeks as the Candida can adapt somewhat quickly to these. I wouldn’t waste my money on the Organika Formula.I have followed this diet 100% strictly for 3 months and STILL have white thrush on my tongue, does anyone know why? Its really bothering me as I cant figure it out!!But the important question is; what’s on the diet you followed?Oh yea I also have cleansed all heavy metals out of my body. I payed some good money to get some good blood tests done and the results were great!  So I know for a fact that heavy metals are not the cause of this. I’ll be the last person to argue that point.  Removing metals may “help” your cause, but the problem is that cleansing metals from the body won’t cure Candida without the correct diet and treatment. Some links you’ll probably benefit from.

7,raster,535,"Acer, check out the allowed foods list we have on the forum. We do not have beef, oatmeal, or yeast free wheat bread on the list.

Its good to be critical. Especially when it concerns your health. Complex carbs are better than white flower for instance, but they are still too tough for your body to handle. Gluten is one of the reasons. Also, the grains contain sugars, and though they are complex, they can still feed your candida. My guess would be that your protocol was not strict enough, and therefore, you did not notice the oatmeal and bread so much. The better you do on the diet, the more sensitive you become. 2 months in, i tried oatmeal and it messed me up, serious bloating and fatigue. Beef made me feel bloated every time. And sourdough bread was too tough on my body, even before the strict diet, causing irritation, temperature swings and constipation. However, everyone is different and you might get away with whole wheat occasionally, though it wont speeden your progress candidawise. Try adding brown rice (or better red/black rice) to your regimen. You can make chicken/rice salads or just have rice dishes with your fish and veggies. Canned fish contains tasty oil (sunflower or olive) which you can use in the cooking. (stirfry)"

13,KennyG,535,"Do you have any silver fillings in your teeth? Candida thrives on mercury fillings so if you have mercury in your teeth, or mercury from vaccines in your body… candida will stay around for life. If you have mercury fillings in your teeth, removing them and detoxing will make candida go away. Find my post “This is a MUST read for everyone with CANDIDA.” I would read all of it even if you don’t have fillings. We all have mercury in our bodies. I tried the candida diet for months and months with no results. I am detoxing mercury from my body right now and the candida is about 60% inproved. This is the best urine test I found!

Don’t get a mercury urine or blood test from a doctor, it’s pointless because they have NO CLUE what they are doing. MD’s know nothing about mercury toxicity, or dental mercury poisoning. Six different doctors told me I am fine and that my blood test for mercury is zero. They also told me that all silver fillings are safe and that they never leak, they even told me I have gone crazy! *Mercury will make you feel and act like a crazy person! If one is poisoned by dental mercury, or other metals, they will usually not show up in blood testing since they are not in the blood. They are in the tissues and have to be provoked out of the tissues and into the blood, urine and feces before they will show up in lab test results. They can be “provoked” out of the tissues by DMSA. Doctors don’t use DMSA so every blood/urine test they give people will always show zero for toxic metals. I got the DMSA urine test and my mercury level was WAY OFF THE CHARTS… severe mercury poisoning. Take care and get well."

Doesn’t sound like either of them are very reliable, if Wikipedia is anything to go by.DMSA is used to help mobilize heavy metals stored in body tissues (and therefore not typically present in the circulation) and increase the excretion of heavy metals in the urine. In a study by Howard Frumkin et al., this sort of test was shown to not reliably provide an indication of past chronic mercury exposure, something it was often used for.[7] A 2004 study by GP Archbold, et al. called the results of a DMSA challenge test “misleading” for the purposes of diagnosing mercury toxicity. Still, I don’t see how any amount of substances like mercury can be a positive thing, so detox should certainly be considered regardless."
0,Jemma,536,"Hi Everyone, I hope someone can help: this is my 4th morning on the ‘cleanse’ as outlined on this website but I feel really terrible! I assume I have candida in the gut becuase I was on 3 different antibiotics for a year and have never felt well since – tiredness, poor memory, bad back, hip and shoulder aches, anxious, mood swings etc. I tried a diet where I just alliminated unnatural sugars, dairy and yeast and my energy and feeling of health was great but I still had bad sugar cravings and did not have much self restraint when it came to eating sweets/chocolate once off the diet etc. I found this website and realised I should have eliminated fruit and sweet potato, underground veg etc from my diet so am now on the ‘cleanse’ as I say. I took acidophillus probiotic (10 billion) for a couple of days but stopped when I read that it should not be started until after the cleanse. I have been eating quinoa with about a tsp coconut oil and cocoa nibs in the morning, having a bit of red pepper for a snack and a salad with some quinoa or rice for lunch, an egg for a snack and steamed cabbage, green beans and leeks with a little bit of rice or walnuts for dinner. I have been taking a multi vit but I’m waiting for the following to arrive: calcium bentonite clay milk thistle pantothenic acid c-1000 vit c tablets now foods: candida clear formula Psyllium Husk Powder Today I am off work because I feel so ill with hot sweats, headache, shaking hands, jittery, anxious feeling, foggy headed and achey. The foggy head is the worst bit – I have a feeling of unreality! I have had a sore throat for the past 2 days but today that seems better. I am starting to worry about these symptoms. Before starting this diet, I just got tired etc as mentioned above. I feel like I am not getting something I need to be healthy. Can anyone advise me; is there a food I can add to my diet without setting my progress back? Do I need to order some molybdenum in order to geet healthy? Can I take paracetamol to help with the feverish symptoms? Any guidance, info or suggestions would be a great reasurance – Thanks in anticipation!"

I havent used it myself but here it is very much recommended for coping with die-off. You can always take probiotics. This is one of the most important things to take. Tisdaleh, same for you. I know its hell but you have to hang in there. The candida is screaming for something to feed on, but you must resist. However, if the cleanse is too much for you, why not switch to stage 1 of the diet instead. Some body types just handle cleanses better than others. Die off symptoms should continue on stage 1."

Ray Peat’s information is completely free on his website, he says that sugar ( sucrose), fruit, milk, meat,fat, eggs, cheese, are all fine it’s grains that are the problem. He also thinks illnes is caused by stress on the body.

0,YeastMan,537,"None of these are a cure, but some have virtually eliminated my symptoms. YMMV. Folk remedies: -Low carb diet (<20g/day) - no noticeable effect. May reduce severity and slow the time to reoccurrence after stopping use of OTC antifungals. -Apple Cider Vinegar (3 weeks) – 2-3 times a day externally and 1oz internally. Topically, it temporarily relieved itching, but otherwise did nothing. -Bleach baths (1/4 cup) (3 weeks) – once every night. No effect, but my fingernails were super clean! -Tea Tree Oil – once every night (4-6 weeks) – Stung, but quickly dried out the area and skin started peeling off my dangly parts. Helped, but not a cure and pervasive odor. -Baking soda (1 time) – burned like hell and made things sweaty. -Coconut oil (1 week, spoonful 2 x daily) – No noticeable effect. Pills: -Garlic pills – 6 x 2mg/day (6 weeks) – Did nothing. Then I read this research paper that showed no effect on Candida and stopped wasting my time/money. -Now Candida Clear (2 weeks) – Contains Pau D’Arco, Black Walnut, Oregano Oil, Biotin and Caprylic Acid. This stuff almost put me in the hospital. Had allergic reaction to something in it, probably the black walnut. -Probiotic (4 months+) – No noticeable effect, but may help. -Caprylic acid (3 months+, off and on) – No noticeable effect, but shown to lower growth rates of Candida. Same ingredient in coconut oil, but more concentrated and without the saturated fat. -Grapefruit Seed extract (3 months+, off and on) – No noticeable effect, but shown to lower growth rates of Candida. The active ingredient in grapefruit (naringine) also has synergistic effects with many drugs and seems to boost their activity. Possibly helps boost other antifungals? Who knows. -Fiber – Cleans out colon and removes Candida. I should take more of this… OTC Drugs: -Tolnaftate – nothing -Terbinafine – nothing -Butenafine – nothing -Clotrimazole – worked fairly well. Relieved itching and started to clear up. Cream, so keeps the area moist. -Miconazole – worked well. Cleared up itching/symptoms within days, but not a cure. Most effective version is spray-on powder version that contains alcohol and talc. Wal-Mart has the cheapest generic at ~$3 for an athlete’s foot version. Was using with Wal-Mart brand “Equate” drying powder (talc, etc.) to keep area dry. Prescription Drugs: -Fluconazole (200mg once weekly for 3 weeks) – oral drug. No effect. Did not take consecutively. -Sulconazole nitrate – extremely expensive. Worked about as well as clotrimazole. Lotion, so does not dry area. -Nystatin – Cream. Worked temporarily. Relieved itching and started to clear up. Stopped working after about 2 weeks."
1,Able900,537,"Out of literally thousands of posts which I’ve read since joining the forum, this is no doubt one of the most ridiculous, ignorant and potentially dangerous posts to date. For someone who wrote the following statements on the forum less than a month ago, I don’t think you’ve been following the correct protocol long enough to be telling anyone what will and what won’t work. YeastMan quote:  “Quit torturing yourselves and start allowing cheese, alcohol and mushrooms into your diet!” And you wrote the following just yesterday:  “Has anyone tried a no carb diet? Essentially eating only meat and protein for X amount of days…” That question and statement shows your complete and total lack of knowledge concerning the biological structure of Candida albicans. NOTE FOR MEMBERS: Of course this person has the right to post anything he wishes to, but I would like to make everyone aware that this information was posted by someone who is still trying to figure out how to cure his infestation and what’s going to work and what won’t. The person has not been on the correct protocol anywhere near long enough (if at all) to justify his statements. Everyone is different and will respond differently to certain antifungals. The garlic information posted is a perfect example. More than a few members have reported terrible die-off symptoms from pure garlic which means that the garlic can and does destroy Candida. I know the poster mentioned ‘garlic pills’ but a responsible person would have added information concerning pure garlic, and the single statement is misleading. Will this cure the infestation? No of course not, but neither will any antifungal we can name, but what it can help with is the initial goal when starting the diet; to kill off as many Candida albicans as possible in order to alleviate some of the symptoms that members are suffering from when they join the forum. IMPORTANT: The test and growth period referred to in the research study which was posted concerning garlic ranged from 2 to 48 hours. Nowhere in our protocol do we suggest stopping the use of a supplement after a total use time of 48 hours or less. Quote: “Probiotic (4 months+) – No noticeable effect, but may help.”  This is the most ridiculous and ignorant statement on the entire post and shows how limited this person’s knowledge is concerning Candida albicans. Did he bother to post the name, count, or strain of the specific probiotic? Did he bother to give a detailed description of the diet and the protocol he used to accompany the probiotic? Of course not, it never occurred to him that this makes a huge difference in the effectiveness of any one product. In fact, he didn’t do this with any of the supplements he mentioned which only increases the misleading factor of the post. Quote: “Fiber – Cleans out colon and removes Candida. I should take more of this…” A terribly misleading statement; fiber is a necessity of a human being’s diet as well as a cleanser but is incapable of removing the Candida overgrowth from the body or curing the infestation; again, very misleading. This person apparently has no sense of responsibility concerning new members who will misunderstand his statements when taken at face value without detailed explanations as well as other possibilities apart from his personal experience with the products named.

Things like organic chicken seem to blow me up which I find very strange. Should I just give it another few weeks on eggs and try again? I’ve ordered Kefir grains as well so I can get started on Kefir. Candida causes excessive bloating… no test is needed to prove that. They do this by fermenting a food item with even a smidgen of sugar in the natural makeup of the foods such as the starch in any type of rice or squash. But to give you an example of how easily foods can be fermented in the intestines, basically all vegetables contain sugar. When an antifungal is taken or when an antifungal food source is eaten, and part of the overgrowth is killed, the result is usually a mild case of bloating, but normally this doesn’t cause excessive bloating. On the other hand, fermentation of the food in the intestines will last longer than the Candida die-off does and normally leads to longer and more excessive bloating. Stopping this process can be accomplished by, number one curing the Candida overgrowth; second, increasing stomach, acid and last but most importantly, increasing the intestinal flora. I labeled this last one most important over curing the overgrowth simply because a cure can’t be reached until the flora is increased sufficiently. Note: Increasing stomach acid can be accomplished by using Hydrochloric acid at meal times. Chicken, even though not as high as red meat, still contains ammonia which is released when the proteins are broken down in the body, and this increase bloating. Able"

I have huge willpower and I really want to get rid of this problem, but my biggest issues are: 1)I spend most of my day Monday-Friday at work which makes more difficult to bring healthy food to eat, but I have tried to follow the diet as close as possible, so when I go to restaurants I try to order either chicken and salad or just plain salad, but given that restaurants don`t know entirely about my problem I don’t know how estricly I`m following the plan, so If I ask for a drink of lemon they might use sugar. 2)I have tried to make all changes on my diet including, shifting from regular milk to almond milk, unfortunaly is sweetened becauses I Haven´t found it unsweetened, also I´m taking probiotics, soful of Yakult one a day, but of course it containse a little bit of sugar.

My question is, while I am trying my best to get rid of the candida I´m afraid that these issues might cause me trouble getting better or that I will not get any results at all and I really want to get better, I just am afraid I will not get any results even if I try my best. Is it possible for me to get better in these conditions? Thanks in advance. –John"
1,Chris24,540,"Good question. And welcome! Your strong willpower will come in handy when you get die off symptoms. That will test you. 1: You can ask in restaurants to only put olive oil on salads, nothing else. Eating out doesnt have to be bad, just make sure they dont use: sugar, soy sauce, or ANY kind of sauce and vinnegar. 2: I’d advice you to stop the sweetened almond milk, and stop the yakult. Yakult is commercial nonsense, so packed with sugar it destroys its own benefits. Stevia good, coconut oil great! Thats is a powerful anti fungal, and easy to incorporate in daily ritual. You can increase your coconut oil intake daily. Now about your question. Will you get better? I cant say that for you on this limited info, but there is one simple golden rule for you to know yourself: If you dont experience die off symptoms, then either you are not trying hard enough, or you dont have candida. Dont know how they feel? Trust me, if you have candida, you will find out soon enough."
2,John Mounts,540,"Thank you for replying chris! To be quite honest it’s been really hard, and as you can see I haven´t been able to follow 100% but I´m trying, it sound harder every step further but I think it´ll be worth the shot. About restaurants I’m trying to be as picky as possible, even telling them what vegetables I want in my plate, but I`m worried about beverages there since I don´t know if they use sugar on them even if is lemon water or something else. About the almond milk that´s a bummer I was actually feeling pretty well with it, but since the moment I read it was recommended unsweetened I knew it wasn´t gonna be just fine, I still wanted to give it a try. Well I’m almost sure I got candida since I have several symptoms that I can’t explain otherwise like the white coated tongue, acne, difficulty losing weight, gas, mocus, Sinucitis, I mean I haven´t been bothered by it, until I heard about candida albincans and everything started to make sense. And about the die-off which creeps the heck out of me, how much will it take to finally happen if I really have the candida, I started feeling some dizziness and nausea this morning, but I feel better right now, I don`t know if It was all in my mind because of reading about it or if it really happened in my body, but I would like to be aware of when could happen so I could be prepared, and how much does it last? 1 day, a week? The coconut oil is pretty good, so I can add up the dosis each day? I read in the site that it´s got to be up to 5, right now I´m just taking one, so I don´t know how effective is being in that dosis and if it will make the die-off to come sooner or later that way. Thanks for all your help, it really makes me feel more confidente about this problem!"
3,Chris24,540,"Skip beverages, water is fine, though you should really limit fluid intake when eating. Die off at least takes 1,5 week, but could go on for some weeks more, depending on your protocol. You can take a lot of coconut oil, and you will notice the effects when you take too much in one serving. Up to a max of 18 spoons a day has been mentioned on this forum. Are you coping with die off now?"
4,John Mounts,540,"Hey Chris! I actually started taking two spoons of coconut oil yesterday, and in the morning I started with diarrhea and some muscular pain, this morning once again I got diarrhea,gas, feel kind of dizzie, and both days I have been feeling fatigue, so much that I couldn´t keep up with my gym rutine yesterday and I decided to go home right away and today I simply decided not to go. At least if this is the die-off I think it´s working so it´s worth, let´s see if it doesn´t get worse. I don´t really feel THAT bad, I have been having slight nauseas and headaches besides the symthoms I mentioned before, I also started taking vitamin C to deal with the die-off, I hope it won´t get worse as I add up more coconut oil to my daily plan. some questions I forgot to ask last time, 1) is the die-off thing a one time thing, or it could happen twice or more during my treatmt? 2)is it useful to use coconut oil on your skin for the treatment of candida? Thank you so much, it´s really been helpful."
5,Chris24,540,"One thing I forgot, to cope with die off and less detrimental effect on your body Molybdenum amino acid chelate is often recommended on this forum. Check it out here http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590 Other things that can directly help you are the spices turmeric and ginger. Ginger is a cure-all, and especially helpful for stomach and digestion issues (also nausea). Turmeric is a strong liver cleanser can be found seperate or in ready made curry powders. Another liver cleanser is lemon. You can use the juice of the lemon and a pinch of salt to make rehydration lemonwater. And then you can use the rest of the flesh and peels of the lemon to make lemonginger tea. I swear, the best start of the day is lemonginger tea on an empty stomach. Especially for die off. Now you are experiencing clear die off symptoms. Exercise will have to wait at this stage. If the die-off feels like too much, then take it easy on the coconut oil. The diet alone can cause serious die off. Later you can check out more antifungals. The initial die off is the worst and is a one time thing.  The second question, you mean the acne? We adress the internal problem because that is where the cause of all the symptoms is. Fixing that should fix the rest. That is, if its really the candida thats causing it. I have heard of ghee relieving rashes and eczema, i can imagine coconut oil doing the same. Oh, are you on probiotics? http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1108_Probiotics-Lactobacillus-acidophilus-DDS1.aspx And more great info here http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx"
6,John Mounts,540,"Once again thank you for all the advice Chris! The Die-off hasn´t been nice but I thought it´d be 1000 times worse, since I just got a few of the sympthoms and some of them have been just slightly present and others have been stronger (diahrrea, fatighe and dizziness), I hope that doesn´t mean I am not doing the treatmeant correctly. Thank you for the ginger and waterlemon recipe, I’ll have it on mind if my sympthoms become intolerable. About the coconut oil on the skin, I have acne, but my question is more if that could also help with my candida problem, since it is said that the candida is also on the skin. About the probiotics I’m having trouble finding organic yogurt, and I don´t know about doing it myself since I could mess up somehow, I would prefer something bought, I saw one bio-yogurt in the store but I don´t know if is good for my probiotic plan 😛 Also, I have been reading great recipes here ( since vegetables and chicken are getting old on my diet) and I wanted to try the almond pancakes and I went to the store to buy some gluten free baking powder, I saw one that contains no sugar but mentioned something about levadura which can be translated to yeast or baking powder for the quimical version and on parenthesis it said “Tetrasodium pyrophosphate, Sodium bicarbonate, Monocalcium phosphate”, so I didn´t buy it since I thought it could make things worse, is it ok to use this on my diet? also can I sweet some of this recipes with vanilla extract? I also found this brown rice cereal  is it good for my diet plan? and for that matter are the gluten free and diabetic zone products useful for the candida diet? Sorry if I am annoying you with all these questions, and I really want to get better, but vegetables and chicken most of the time is kind of driving me crazy"
7,Chris’87,540,"Yo its me (Chris24) My account got banned for reasons unknown to me. Questions are good, especially when it concerns your health. Im also learning from your questions, that is why I am here, and I am greatful for learning. The candida is in the gut. I dont think putting it on your skin will do more than eating it. Commercial yogurt works, but not for all people. Some people should not have it, as it can cause indigestion and bloating. Try out greek yogurt (it has the lowest sugar amount) and see what it does for you. Also check out the possibility of making kefir. The baking powder ingredients should be alright, although I was confused by the levadura, which means yeast. Levadura química should be baking powder.  Sodium bicarbonate is the actual baking powder. If you’re unsure go to the organic store. There is baking powder without other ingredients. Unfortunately, the brown rice cerial is not allowed, as it contains brown rice syrup. Whats good for diabetics is often not good for candida sufferers. So what it comes down to is that we have to make our own stuff, which you can find on the recipe section. You have to get creative. You can eat brown rice with your vegetables, but red rice or black rice would be better. And what about fish? I eat canned fish every day and use the oil (often sunflower or olive) from it in my food. Easy too."
8,needtogetthisshitsorted,540,How would it even be possible to eat out during this diet?

Eating out is pretty hard. Indian restaurants have some valid stuff. Tapas bar has some good options, and you can ask the waiter what each meal contains. The rest is all salads without dressing and fish without marinade or sauce. Grilled chicken is fine too. You cant really cheat on this or be like “what the hell”, as it will often set you back too much and demotivate you, causing you to quit and binge on sugar, and youll feel even worse. It is just not worth it."

I also checked it out and you are right about the baking powder, it also contains inulina which I have heard is good. Now I got a new question, it’s been impossible to find coconut milk or almond milk unsweetened, but I found this canary grass seed milk, I checked the nutrimental chart and I saw that it contains no sugar and no carbohydrates, but before trying it or even buying it, I wanted to know if this was allowed on the diet? Once again thanks a lot for your help and support!"

14,jessy,540,"Hi all, I am also new here, i successfully treating my 3 year old autistic son who has a leaky gut and was diagnosed by our DAN nutritionist as having candida overgrowth, we started him on a candida formula and eliminated dairy and gluten from his diet, within a couple of weeks he had started to say some words (though still not able to hold conversation) and his behavior had drastically improved.All this just from treating the gut along with some dietary changes, it just goes to show how much candida is a problem with kids these days with behavioral problems.It was this turnaround which spurned my to provide my own line of products to treat digestive problems.Has anybody else had experience with treating kids for candida?"

3,Lorelei,541,Thanks for sharing. Something else for us to learn about.
4,Chris24,541,"The MMS log. My case: 9 years depression and chronic fatigue. Hypersensitive (constant stress). The candida problem came in about 4 years ago due to bad diet, depression, and stress. Its lodged in deep in the gut as I have made it worse and worse in the years that I just ignored it and was stuffing myself with alcohol and sugar. I have tried to deal with it last year with significant healing results after about 8 weeks with diet, and ridiculous amounds of supplements, probiotics and anti fungals: spirulina, neem tree and MMS (all taken together though). Physical drawback and psychological problems made me fall back into destructive habits, and straying too far of the diet while drinking coffee and alcohol over the course of last year have brought the candida back in full force. I am currently unable to work, study, or do anything productive. Candida is not the whole problem, but a very crucial part of it. Here we go: Recieved the MMS today and started with the recommended 1 drop. No bad reaction.(which could be nausea, vomiting, stomach ache). As I have taken this stuff before, I am going to up the dose pretty quickly each day until I reach the maximum of 14 drops per serving. Today I will have another drop. If it goes well I’ll go to 2 drops per serving tomorrow, 4 times a day. This should cause reactions. I have quit all anti fungals besides a little coconut oil. I have been on the strict diet now for 4/5 weeks. Felt like crap the entire time, serious die-off. And I still feel shitty. But I know that I’m doing stuff wrong. My symptoms: – Chronic fatigue – Brainfog, feeling completely spaced out – Rectal itching – Constipation/irregular bowel movements – Bloating/feeling of brick in stomach after taking certain heavy foods – Being out of breath for no reason – Muscle pain in the legs/heavy legs – Feeling hot one moment and cold the next – Concentration problems – Depression Things that comprimise my progress: – Smoking (a joint a day, with tobacco) – Cheating with these foods: cashews, (organic) beef, tomatoes. – I did not do the cleanse, just lunged into the diet. (really quitting coffee and alcohol addiction was a very big deal) – bad state of mind – No exercise (no energy) – No raw vegetables ever Things that I do right: – Probiotics at night – Coconut oil (couple of spoons a day on coconut/chicory cake) – Tons of exotic spices in my food – A lot of lemon ginger tea – Eat plenty of onion and a decent amount of garlic – Sticking to the diet besides the cheats. This lifestyle routine is expected to last for at least a few weeks, therefore, I think it is safe to say that if I make any significant progress, it is because of the MMS. I will report any changes, good or bad."
5,Chris24,541,Update: Just took the second drop and already some very noticable stomach rumbling and stuff going on in the gut. Havent felt it this noticable in weeks.
6,Able900,541,"MMS destroys beneficial bacteria in the intestines. MMS can also be contradictory to supplements because it’s an oxidizer so it’s able to break down and lessen the effect of vitamins and other nutrients.

It also reacts with ammonia (Candida produce ammonia) which then can form a highly toxic form of chloramine.

Chlorine, oppositely, adds a chlorine atom to or substitutes a chlorine atom from the substance it reacts with.” From what I’ve read elektrons are pulled from only pathogens, destroying them and leaving the good bacteria untouched. Is chlorine dioxide safe? The Niagara Falls New York water treatment plant first used chlorine dioxide for drinking water disinfection in 1944. Currently, there are approximately 400 – 500 water treatment plants in the United States and over 1000 in Europe utilizing ClO2 to purify municipal drinking water systems.

Difference.  “Contrary to chlorine, chlorine dioxide does not react with ammonia nitrogen (NH3) and hardly reacts with elementary amines. It does oxidize nitrite (N02) to nitrate (NO3). It does not react by breaking carbon connections. No mineralization of organic substances takes place. At neutral pH or at high pH values, sulphuric acid (H2SO3) reduces chlorine dioxide to chlorite ions (ClO2-). Under alkalic circumstances chlorine dioxide is broken down to chlorite and chlorate” “What’s the difference between chlorine and chlorine dioxide? While chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has chlorine in its name, chlorine dioxide’s chemistry is different from that of chlorine. Unlike the more common chlorine, chlorine dioxide, at appropriate concentrations, is non-mutagenic, non-carcinogenic, and relatively non-irritating. When ClO2 is added to water, it dissolves without ionizing. Or more specifically, when exposed to water, ClO2 does not release a chlorine atom to form hydrochloric acid as does chlorine, nor does it combine with organics to form chlorinated hydrocarbons, which are carcinogenic. One atom can make all the difference — just as hydrogen is an explosive gas, but when combined with oxygen becomes dihydrogen oxide – commonly known as water (H2O).”Able900 wrote:  MMS = Miracle Mineral Supplement I’ve always been at least a little apprehensive about a supplement claiming to be a ‘cure’ and has the word ‘miracle’ tacked onto its name, and especially if it isn’t natural to the human body and contains a known problematic component.

9,Thomas,541,"Hi Chris24, thank you for updating. I reading your post with very much interests.  Your list of symptoms are like mine and its the first time I really see my problems addressed so clearly. Heavy brain fog, rectal itching, heavy legs, depression, out of breath for no reason etc. Do you have your symptoms all the same at the same time or are they rotating. I noticed when I am spaced out with brain fog and dizzy ness, I often dont have rectal itching. Then it can itch like crazy but I am not spaced out or have stomach pains. Then what really confuses me is that I can have for weeks on end this carousel going round and round and suddenly it stops for 3 to 4 days and I feel like a new born human being. Like a miracle would have thrown the sunlight into my sickly health. Then the merry goes round again and again. Keep us updated of your progress mate! cheers Thomas"
10,Chris24,541,"Good to hear Thomas, I guess I’m doing this for both of us now 😉 Yeah I have seen some of your reactions on the forum and noticed you have done a lot to cure yourself. You must have been through hell with all the trying. I really respect your persistence. Now that you mention it, yes, my symptoms are rotating like yours. My wild guess is that when we are spaced out for instance, that the body is really working hard on the gut area. Then, when it is done we get the rectal slime and itch (toxins that the body dealt with exiting the anus?). Being spaced out and the itch are not at the same time yes. Could even be a day between."

Like you said that you got a sudden reaction to food. I could not figure really out what is doing what in me. If my brain-fog, when I have it, comes from a food reaction, die-off or lack of something. Then if it comes from feeding the candida or an overproduction of histamine do to the hyper active immune defence. Or is the immune defence over-active because of the candida, releasing histamine into the blood and giving us all the sympthoms. What I found very interesting is that nearly all other groups have the same symptoms as the candida sufferers. IBS, Histamine overproduction, Hypoglycemia, UC, etc. How do you guys believe in the subject of auto-immune diseases? Do you believe that the body suddenly gets nuts and attacks itself or is there always an underlying factor like that of candida or an intolerance or an allergic reaction? cheers  thomas"

0,needtogetthisshitsorted,542,"Hi All, After many failed attempts of the candida diet, purchasing Threelac, anti-fungals, yeast raiders etc… I think I maybe ready to get strict on myself. The one problem I have is THE PUB and ALCOHOL. I know many of you will think what the point is in this post… but It is SO HARD. The hardest part is I am a musician, I am sociable, I do gigs, meet people and often in bars/pubs etc. So my question to you..IS there ANYTHING I can drink at a pub that wouldn’t screw this diet up. From reading many forums, soft drinks are out of the question. So is tonic.. What about soda water? Is that ok? And also if anybody out there knows of a magical drink that has the same buzzy affect as alcohol that has no sugar in that I can take in a hip-flask to the pub, then that would be awesome..

3,Marbro,542,Sour beers without added fruit juice or sugars may be ok later on in the diet. But no point starting the diet if you are not going to stay with it. Killing and feeding candida in a cycle is just pumping toxins in your body and making your organs work overtime. Frankly I think this is more harmful than just having candida. Work towards the diet and when your mentally ready to tackle it for good then go for it.

Unfortunately, there is no other option for contraception for me as my partner has herpes and we dont really like to risk it. So I am appealing to any of you if you’ve tried a different type of condom (latex free for example) and just see if you experience less symptoms after using different brands. Also any opinions on lubricants? That further/less irritate the vagine? Thank you."

0,Eileen40,544,"I started Stage One, the diet, a few days ago. Now my body is covered with an itchy red rash that is driving me crazy! The coating on my tongue is mostly gone, but this rash is making me wonder if I’ll be able to go the weeks it takes for my body to detox and eliminate the fungus. History: Two months ago, I was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery. They kept me for five days on an IV drip filled with antibiotics. I continued to take oral antibiotics for another week after leaving the hospital. I’ve had cadiditis before, but this is the worst it has ever been. Please help Has anyone else had this rash? What did you do? How long did it last?"
1,sby,544,I have recently begun the cleanse and a few days ago hives appeared on my head and back of neck. They itch too. I’m assuming they’re a result of my cleansing. Not sure how to ease the itch either. Anyone have any advice?
2,Able900,544,"Has anyone else had this rash? What did you do? How long did it last? Yes, most people have a rash when the treatment is working. Rash which starts or becomes worse after a treatment is started most always represents a healing reaction of the body. This is to say that it’s part of the cure actually. The poisons have to come out when your healing, and this is just one way that takes place. Are you using the supplement Molybdenum to help with the reactions? If not, you should try to obtain it. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590 Able"

4,Able900,544,"sby wrote: Yes, I began the Molybedenum yesterday or day before. Should I be taking more than the 250 mg at this point because of the hives. Thanks. Yes, I would take 250 mcg three times a day. This may not help a lot with the rash, but then again it might. At any rate, this supplement is going to protect the liver and kidneys from the toxins, and this is what you really need. PS: You typed mg instead of mcg, did you mean to do that? If so, you probably won’t need any more than that. Able"
5,sby,544,"Able… Yes I meant ‘mcg’. Also, just want to give a shout-out for epsom salts. A bath as hot as one can stand with 2 cups of epsom salts really helps to pull out toxins if one soaks for at least 20-30 minutes. It definitely helped relieve the itchiness for several hours at a time for me, until the bumps and itchiness finally disappeared (took about a week). In between soaks I’d use a washcloth soaked in a bowl of hot water and epsom salts and apply where necessary. Also, it can be added (1-2 teaspoons) to a flush…it’s a really good bowel mover and toxin remover. Susan"
6,greebles,544,"@sby I too have a terribly itchy rash. I don’t have a bath, but scrubbing selsun blue (with hands) and very hot water followed with calamine lotion has really been helping my itching. I still can’t sleep through the night but it is much less itchy during the day. I think it’s the calamine that relieves the itch. good luck! I know for me, the rash is the worst part of my candidiasis"
7,sby,544,"Hi Greebles, I’ve been soaking every two days with the epsom salts and the rash is dissipating and the itchiness is much better. I’m not familiar with Selsun Blue.

The candida diet contains healthful food, lots of veggies which I should be eating and I am not. One thing I don’t and not sure I can give up is coffee. Do you think 1 or 2 black coffees a day is really going to make a difference? I can’t wake up without it and I need one in the afternoon too or I’ll pass out. I want to commit to this program but giving up coffee?  Why live?"
1,Ninni,545,"Coffee burdens the liver which needs to be strong to fight the candida. It’s also very acidic with isn’t good because candida loves an acidic body. It also raises blood sugar levels which is very bad as well. Coffee also just picks you up, then dumps you. Not good for stable energy levels. Good luck I know it’s a hard one!"

8,whyitsme,545,"My naturopath said I could drink coffee. I realize many of the candida diet lists say no, there are lists that say 1-2 cups is ok. Figure the diet is hard enough, why give up the coffee if giving up everything else. I do however buy the flavored beans, that way no cream or sugar is required, It is flavorful enough black."
9,Eileen40,545,"Coffee or Diet Soda. Coffee or Diet Soda. A friend from Europe sent me some coffee, so I’m going to try a little. This is the worst time of year to go on this restrictive diet. No egg nog, no chocolate, no traditional foods. If the gas, the itching, and the depression don’t end because I’m drinking coffee, I’ll quit after the new year! (I’m on week 2.)"
10,Bizo,545,"I am getting ready to start the diet on Tuesday. I love coffee. Over the past month I reduced my caffeine intake from 4 cups in the morning to 2. Today I started drinking it black. Tomorrow I am going to try to have 1 cup and I am hoping that by the time I start the diet I will be down to one cup black. Depending on how that goes, I may or may not give it up totally. On thing I wonder though, is that on the list it says you can’t have tea and coffee because it has caffeine, but then is says you can have green tea. Green tea has caffeine, so there must be other reasons besides caffeine that coffee is not allowed? Another thing I am considering is making my own chai from almond milk and spices. Many of the spices in chai tea are anti fungal and it is a delicious tea. I might use a little black tea in there too. If I come up with a good recipe I will post it. It might need a bit of stevia too."
11,Citizen123,545,"Coffee is not allowed on a Candida diet because coffee beans are FERMENTED; not because of “caffeine” itself. People do not drink “caffeine”, they drink “coffee”. Caffeine itself does not stimulate Candida in the body. Chamomile; Mint and Peppermint are acceptable herbal teas. Stay away from herbal teas that contain fruit ( orange peel, etc.)"
12,Bizo,545,sauerkraut and yogurt are also FERMENTED and they are recommended foods to consume on the diet.
13,Remek,545,"This should be helpful “Too Much Caffeinated Coffee and Tea: I enjoy a good cup of coffee. And honestly, I drank coffee off and on during my own candida cleansing with no adverse effects. Some people tolerate and even benefit from a moderate amount of coffee on a daily basis, while others feel better totally avoiding it. Overdoing caffeine can leach calcium from the body and puts a strain on the adrenal system and immune system, for some more than others. Anyone who is doing a candida cleansing program already has a weakened immune system or the candida wouldn’t be able to wreak such havoc. If you tend to drink a lot of coffee or caffeinated tea every day, then, just for now, you might try to gradually reduce your daily intake to one or two cups. If coffee makes you feel good then by all means, there’s no reason to give it up completely! If you add sweetener make sure it’s stevia. Good Alternatives:Add some organic swiss water process decaf coffee to your regular coffee. Herbal teas are good instead of the caffeinated varieties, especially later in the day, to avoid the caffeine messing with your sleep. My favorite morning cuppa:I love yerba mate tea, which does have a stimulating effect, but not quite the same as regular coffee or tea, and it’s loaded with health benefits.

14,HealMyGuts,545,"I, for the most part, have given up coffee. I used to drink at least 3 cups every morning. I don’t even remember when I gave it up, or why, but I know it was before I started the Candida Diet. I used to be one of those, “I need my coffee in the morning or else I can’t function,” people. Now I honestly don’t even think twice about it. I have actually found that being on the Candida Diet is a MUCH bigger help when waking up in the morning. With coffee I would wake up groggy, get out of bed groggy, put on a pot of coffee groggy, take a shower groggy, then drink my coffee and maybe a half an hour later the caffeine would hit me. Then I would have energy for a couple hours and totally crash. On the Candida Diet I have found it the easiest to get up in the morning that I ever have. My mind wakes up, I open my eyes, and after about 2 minutes I am fully awake. It has been almost disorienting because this has never happened to me before.I have been doing fairly well on the Candida Diet. Even after a couple days of not being super strict on the diet, I still can wake up in an instant. I don’t know the science behind whether or not Coffee is good or bad on the Candida Diet, but I do know that for me, by following the Diet pretty closely, Coffee is not needed. I don’t know if that will help, but I hope it does!"

I don’t know why you couldn’t stick with the diet during the flu since it’s a healthy diet, unless you’re talking about adding more protein?

Yes, kefir grains can certainly be eaten. I think, therefore I feel, that this is an essential part of the kefir-culturing process or kefir-ritual as a whole. I was encouraged to ingest kefir grains over 24 years ago, by the person who was kind enough to share some of her kefir grains with me. She was also encouraged to ingest excess kefir grains,by the person from whom she initially obtained her grains from. Later I began researching kefir, where I came across references explaining that the Caucasians also ingested kefir grains on a regular basis. Suggestions that state kefir grains do not contain any nutritional value … or are unsafe to ingest … is plain-flavoured bull-ox. Not only do kefir grains contain proteins, amino acids and fats, the fact that they have anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory properties, blood pressure normalizing property including high blood cholesterol reducing activity among other beneficial value, is becoming more evident [1, 2]. Ingesting kefir grains regularly, has helped to cure Gastric Ulcers in personal friends and acquaintances, which I’ve had the pleasure of knowing and treating over some years. I’ve also used the ingestion of 2 Tbs milk kefir-grains each day over a 2 week period [with rectally retained implants of kefir grains], to successfully treat Ulcerative Colitis in my case, in 1999. I have been asymptomatic ever since. Each gram of kefir grain contain billions of friendly microbes and yeasts. Who needs a probiotic supplements in pill form, when kefir grains are fresh and possibly superior!? There may also be specific encapsulate microbes within the matrix, which may not be found in a liquid kefir. Ingesting these may give unique benefits.” For Individuals Who Wish To Ingest excess Kefir Grains [recipes included] read more http://users.chariot.net.au/~dna/kefir-faq.html#ingestingkg"

I don’t think I have any of the real hardcore syntomes I’ve read about as brain fog and things like that. I have asthma been used medicine for about 31 years different kinds but always ones with steroides, and I have been vaccinated for grass allagi with was many shots 25 years ago. I’ve only had candida in groin 5 years ago but that went away with use og creme for 2 weeks. Maybe hard to tell but can anyone tell why I have candida? And is it overgrov? And can only be cure with the right diet plus the probiotics ?"
1,Able900,550,"I stopped for 8 days and after 5 it started to comeback, why is that? That’s because cream cannot cure a Candida infestation, it only treats the symptoms and not the cause. If you have Candida, you probably need to follow a treatment protocol. There’s one on the site. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Able"

Thanks, ND A racing heart is nothing to mess around with. I recommend you see a doctor about that. Did you have that prior to starting this diet? If not, then I would stopt the diet and see a doctor to make sure you do not have other issues outside of candida die off. If you are intent on staying on the diet and not seeing a doctor, can you order molybdenum with chelate online from Ireland? If you can, I would hold off on the diet, if sweating toxins out, milk thistle and vitamins do not help. I had dizziness, nausea, headaches, rashes, and swollen gums when I started the diet. But i have not heard of folks having a racing or irregular heartbeat. I have heard of it outside of this diet forum and in that scenario, IT was highly recommended a doctor be seen. It could be nothing serious but again, your heart is something you don’t want to take chances with."
2,ND83,551,"Thanks for the quick reply! No I’ve had no previous issues with racing heart beat. Either way the vomiting and nausea doesn’t seem worth it! Especially when I have to go to work today. I’ll probably hold off until I can get the Molybdenum and go from there. Thanks again, ND"
3,raster,551,"All of the symptoms you are mentioning are normal die-off symptoms. I have heard of many people having the racing heart symptom and its related to die-off. I have had it myself, and it would appear on occasion for months after I started the diet. But after 9 months on the diet I have not had this symptom for quite a long time and it’ll eventually get better. Candidate is an alternative to molybdenum you can get that helps with die-off symptoms. Also sweating out the toxins via the skin by doing a hot tub, jacuzzi, steam room, or even hot bath can help with the relief of symptoms. Other anti-oxidents can also be beneficial for die-off symptoms. Have you seen the protocol? I assume so because you are doing the lemon cleanse… -raster"
4,Marbro,551,"Call your doctor right away if: •You feel frequent extra heartbeats (more than 6 per minute or coming in groups of 3 or more). •You have risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol, diabetes, or high blood pressure. •You have new or different heart palpitations. •Your pulse is more than 100 beats per minute (without exercise, anxiety, or fever). it could be die off but it also could be heart disease, hell it might be too much anxiety. Heart palpitations can be caused by: •Anemia •Anxiety, stress, fear •Caffeine •Certain medications, including those used to treat thyroid disease, asthma, high blood pressure, or heart problems  •Cocaine •Diet pills •Exercise •Fever •Hyperventilation •Low levels of oxygen in your blood •Heart valve disease, including mitral valve prolapse •Nicotine •Overactive thyroid I come from a family with heart problems and like I said, its not something you can just write off as another symptom of die off even if the odds are it is.

5,ND83,551,"Thanks Raster! I have to admit yesterday after I’d been sick all morning at work, I gave in! I ordered the molybdenum online and it will be here next week. I decided that until it gets here I will ween myself off sugar and carbs so that I don’t have to cold go turkey again. I am a healthy 28 year old, not overweight but I do like my carbs! And my coffee…. oh and chocolate! 🙂 So I’m hoping by weening myself that it will be a bit easier when the molybdenum comes and I can start the cleanse again. I was very committed to sticking with it Tuesday but then when I woke up like that yesterday…. its not easy being sick anytime, especially at work! I believe that what I did on Tuesday was correct? Hot water in the a.m, then lemon water 3xday, and just veg? I also took the Vitamin C and the Milk thistle. I read somewhere else that if your experiencing really bad die-off symptoms during the cleanse that you can eat half a cup of brown rice to get your blood sugar up a bit? Do you have any other suggestions? Marbro: Once I ate a piece of toast and a banana and got my blood sugars up the racing heart stopped. There are no risk factors in my family and I am a healthy, active person. I think part of my problem was I was fighting so hard not to get sick and I was having hot flashes. I see now that it probably was a die-off symptom…. but i’ll keep an eye on it! Thanks for your concern. I plan to try again once the molybdenum gets here and I’ll see how I go. Thanks again to both of you. Nicky"
0,Pattinoo,552,"Hi… I’m on day 10 and have seen some definite improvements but my biggest drawback is reducing me to tears. I am having such indigestion and Painful belching that it has made me sit up in my bath and also cry out. I have possibly had this thing for over 15 years and this diet and diagnosis have come in my path several times. With increasing symptoms and it coming up again I could no longer avoid it. My diet has been really limited for past 3 days and though slowly improving, egg for breakfast and hard boiled egg and celery for lunch which is more than in the past few months, I am concermed if I am damaging things more. I skipped the lemon water for a couple days hoping this would heal. Went back on some daily bitters today while I wait for the Swedish to come in the mail and it helped but only for a while. I’m at a loss as to what to do. Add lemon water back in or no? I got some herbal tea for indegeation but don’t want to take it before I check in. It has ok ingredients but also has bitter fennel fruit, papaya leaf and alfalfa leaf.  I had my gall bladder out last Jan and am not sure about that being a factor. Also, I question h pylori just as a thought but if I try to get it tested and tell my md what I’m doing shell thing I’m crazy. Supportive in many things not with this. I need relief and had a few suggestions but any more will be appreciated I checked a homeopathic remedy then read it’s based in lactose. Ugh it’s everywhere! Changed my toothpaste today. I’m trying to do everything and do it right and disciplined. I feel as though it I could get past this hurdle, I’m on my way…thanks."
1,Pattinoo,552,"I always forget a question. My milk thistle contains blessed thistle. Ok or no? Also, Candidate is on back order but when I get it can I take that and Molybdenum at the same time?  Also, and there goes my other question, flying right out of my head."
2,Able900,552,"I am having such indigestion and Painful belching that it has made me sit up in my bath and also cry out. I have possibly had this thing for over 15 years and this diet and diagnosis have come in my path several times. Are you saying you’ve had the indigestion for 15 years or you’ve had Candida for 15 years? Excessive belching, if not caused by swallowing air is probably caused by the fermentation of food in the stomach which is caused by a lack of stomach acid, and H. pylori can cause low stomach acids. Below is a recent post concerning H. pylori. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst2570_h-ployri.aspx The bitters won’t create stomach acid, that’s why they only help for a short while. The bitters can stimulate the release of the stomach acid, but of course if there is little to no stomach acid available, then there’s nothing to stimulate. Some supplements that will help the problem are raw apple cider vinegar, zinc, and a product by the name of Hydrochloric acid. I think all of these are definitely worth a try. As far as taking Molybdenum and Candidate together is concerned; Molybdenum should be taken every day, the amount depends on the present state of die-off. Candidate on the other hand doesn’t need to be taken unless the symptoms start, then you can take it immediately since it works on a more immediate basis than Molybdenum does.I always forget a question. My milk thistle contains blessed thistle. Ok or no? As long as it also contains milk thistle. Blessed thistle is used to increase ‘Mother’s milk.’ Able"
3,Pattinoo,552,Thanks Able. The candida for 15 years. The acidy stomach and indigestion just the last 3-4 days which is why I might rule out H. Pylori. I would think I’d need symptoms for longer than that.

3,Marbro,554,"Quote from my post. I have no doubt that Able, Raster or one of the other folks would answer you but a quick search would have given you the answer Here is a quote from Able after I asked basically the same thing. “The most beneficial way to take probiotics and antifungals is below. You can take a probiotic 1 hour before your meal or 2 hours afterwards, but no closer. You can take an antifungal immediately before, during, or after a meal. You should not take an antifungal within three hours of taking a probiotic including capsules, kefir, yogurt and sauerkraut. I know this sounds difficult, but all you can do is the best you can. We’ve all had to at least try to do this, and there are a few of us here who are proof that it can be done correctly. When I took probiotics twice a day, I would take one around 11 PM so that there was no problem with taking it on an empty stomach. I would then set my clock for six hours later at 5 AM and take the second probiotic capsule; I would then go back to sleep getting up a few hours later for a shower and breakfast. You can work it out, just work on your own schedule.” Able"

0,charlie1,557,"Hi Everyone! I had a food intolerance test nearly a year ago and apart from certain foods it listed it mentioned candida. I then started to cut out all the problem foods it mentioned and sticking to a certain diet I noticed improvements. The improvements came after about a week into the diet but that first week I noticed that things seemed worse as I had quite noticeable stomach discomfort. Even though I had stomach or abdomen discomfort before – this was quite different. Unfortunately I found I strayed back to problem foods again and the certain symptoms came back and this happened and few times last year as I went back and forth between the safe versus problem foods. The main thing I noticed was that every time I managed to stay on the safe foods I noticed this first week where I would feel worse before feeling amazing like I never hadn’t felt in years. As I say I’ve gone back and forth between feeling good and bad but I’ve always known if I can go back to the safe foods then I’ll be ok – That is until about two months ago. I took a supplement called pau d’arco and ever since then things have been up and down massively, I mainly have constant stomach/abdomen discomfort abit like before when starting the safe diet, but now it seems constant. I have constantly been staying on the safe diet since this time as well. Just to mention my worst symptom was constant exhaustion/fatigue before starting the diet and that completely vanished after the first week of starting. Also – my doctor and others including a gastroenterologist have told me that it’s IBS – I’ve also had endoscopy – they say the same but I’m not completely convinced. I would like to ask – Is this symptom of feeling worse before feeling better a sign of DIE-OFF? could it be that I’m just experiencing a much longer and worse period of DIE-OFF now as compared to before after taking that supplement? And has anyone used pau d’arco before? – it’s a South American tree bark known for it’s anti-yeast and inflammation properties. Any comments, thoughts, suggestions well received – Thankyou."
1,Able900,557,"Hello, and welcome to the forum. I’ll post my comments to your message below.I took a supplement called pau d’arco and ever since then things have been up and down massively, I mainly have constant stomach/abdomen discomfort a bit like before when starting the safe diet, but now it seems constant. I have constantly been staying on the safe diet since this time as well. Pau d’arco in tea or herbal form comes with a couple of side effects. Number one to be concerned about is the blood thinner effect which it presents. So if you’re taking this, you don’t want to cut yourself badly or have surgery.  Other side effects are stomach problems such as nausea and diarrhea. Sure it’s a fairly good antifungal, but so are lots of other safer supplements. These are the reasons you won’t find it on our protocol here on the forum.I would like to ask – Is this symptom of feeling worse before feeling better a sign of DIE-OFF? Yes it is, but there are lots of products that can cause die-off; and the die-off can be controlled very easily. Just read the post below. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590could it be that I’m just experiencing a much longer and worse period of DIE-OFF now as compared to before after taking that supplement? Yes, that’s possible, but again, it can be easily controlled.And has anyone used pau d’arco before? – it’s a South American tree bark known for it’s anti-yeast and inflammation properties. It’s the opinion of many people that the attributes of pau d’arco are not worth the risks, and that’s especially true when you consider the fact that the same attributes are available in other supplements but without the side effects. The protocol that most of the members are using is linked below. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Able"

3,Able900,557,"charlie1 wrote: Is this a normal sign of DIE-OFF? “Stomach discomfort” is a normal occurance during every stage of a Candida albicans infestation. In other words, if you have the infestation you can’t attribute stomach problems in general to any one thing connected to Candida as it’s really impossible to know exactly why it’s happening at any given time other than to say simply that the Candida is causing it. According to the research and talking with hundreds of people online about the infestation, my guess is that at least 99.99% of sufferers experience some type of stomach problems during the infestation. So to answer your question, yes. Able"

The paper was written by Dr C. Pina-Vaz. His report said that, in tests, Ibuprofen exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans strains. The tests they did indicated that the killing the Candida cells was a result of direct damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. To shorten the story, in the end the statement was that there was an advantage in making use of the drug’s antifungal as well as the anti-inflammatory properties.

Also, I had curry I made with all ok ingredients except 1, speghetti squash. I looked it up on a glycimic chart and it was listed as the same as other veggies that are on this forums list. Maybe not all charts are equal? So am I back to square 1? should I clense again with lemon water? I still drink lemon water once day but should I go back to 3 times daily? Should I continue my probionics, anti fungles? Advice please Marbro"
3,Able900,563,"Marbro wrote: I woke up this morning with some of my candida symtoms back…  corn beef and cabage.First of all, corn beef is a cured meat which you shouldn’t be having at all. The other thing is, it’s also red meat and when it’s broken down, it creates ammonia in your body which benefits the Candida as well as adding even more toxins for your body and liver to have to deal with eliminating. You should really avoid red meat indefinitely to be honest, or basically until you’ve cured the infestation.So am I back to square 1?  should I clense again with lemon water? I still drink lemon water once day but should I go back to 3 times daily?No, you’re not back to square one, but lemon water certainly isn’t going to hurt anything, and is actually a good idea to do a couple of times a day for cleansing purposes.Should I continue my probionics, anti fungles?Definitely do this.

0,Ibiza-Rio,565,"Can anyone with a medical background please translate this study: http://m.jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/55/2/223.full A few sentences have given me hope: ” It can be assumed that liposome-mediated delivery of chloroquine to macrophages results in an unfavourable (alkaline) environment for the growth of C. neoformans inside macrophages” “Thus, the use of chloroquine for prevention and treatment of fungal infections could result in improved outcome by decreasing morbidity from both the fungal as well as HIV infection.” “”Moreover, the antifungal activity of fluconazole increases when used in combination with liposomal chloroquine” The study is aimed at the effect on C. neoformans and not Candida Albicans but a google Search reveals that they are both fungi so hopefully results are similar?? I have been fatigued and sleeping non stop for the last 4 days and thought it may have been a side effect of the malaria pills I was taking. However fatigue is not a common side effect, especially to the degree that I have been getting it, which lead me to think that maybe the chloroquine and candida may be contraindicated. Instead I stumbled upon this study which could in fact suggest the contrary! I am now crossing my fingers and toes that my fatigue is simply die off as the last of my candida is brutally slaughtered by the chloroquine!!! Thoughts anyone?!?"
1,Able900,565,"“Moreover, the antifungal activity of fluconazole increases when used in combination with liposomal chloroquine” With this information, one would assume that if fluconazole is the antifungal being used against Candida albicans, and adding liposomal chloroquine results in an increased potency of fluconazole against the C. albicans, then what you’re suggesting seems more than just plausible.The study is aimed at the effect on C. neoformans and not Candida Albicans but a google Search reveals that they are both fungi so hopefully results are similar??Since they’re both a fungi, it makes sense that it would work at least to some degree against C. albicans as well.I have been fatigued and sleeping non stop for the last 4 days and thought it may have been a side effect of the malaria pills I was taking.

Without finding a study showing that liposomal chloroquine is also effective against C. albicans fungi, one can only assume that it is from the apparent positive effects it presents (if one can call die-off symptoms positive).

The most beneficial way to take probiotics and antifungals is below. You can take a probiotic 1 hour before your meal or 2 hours afterwards, but no closer. You can take an antifungal immediately before, during, or after a meal. You should not take an antifungal within three hours of taking a probiotic including capsules, kefir, yogurt and sauerkraut. I know this sounds difficult, but all you can do is the best you can. We’ve all had to at least try to do this, and there are a few of us here who are proof that it can be done correctly. When I took probiotics twice a day, I would take one around 11 PM so that there was no problem with taking it on an empty stomach. I would then set my clock for six hours later at 5 AM and take the second probiotic capsule; I would then go back to sleep getting up a few hours later for a shower and breakfast. You can work it out, just work on your own schedule. Able"
2,Marbro,566,thanks! this was bugging me and I have now changed my plan to accomidate.
0,JohnnyPonny,567,Found these two yogurt types yesterday and ordered them. The nice thing about them is that you dont need a “yogert maker” etc. Fil mjølk yogurt: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Fil-Mjolk-Yogurt-Starter-ORGANIC-/390375574455?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item5ae4328bb7 Viili yogurt: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Viili-Culture-Yogurt-Starter-Finnish-Curd-ORGANIC-/390377092870?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item5ae449b706 You will probely find the produkts on other sites to. This was the most ideal place for ordering in my case. *JohnnyPonny*
1,Lorelei,567,Hello JP –  Have you gotten a chance to try the yoghurts yet? I emailed them to ask what strains were in the yoghurt and what the ideal room temperature is. Our house is at about 66 during the day and 60 at night. It might be to cold…
2,JohnnyPonny,567,Hey No havent got the starters yet. Probely a good idea to check out before ordering. I just saw the word “probiotic” in the headline and thought this has to be a produkt for me. Really hope that I can consume them without problems. Seems so much easyer. Btw read good stuff about “Caspian sea yogurt”. Wish I ordered that one too. *JohnnyPonny*
3,Lorelei,567,"I’m checking it out too. They got back to me right away and said as long as you wrap a big towel around the jar, it will be fine. (ferment ok that is.) I did post a question on the yeast content of the Viili yoghurt and the water kefir grains. Wikipedia has the kefir grains listed as containing candida. Did you check out their website? http://www.savvyteasandherbs.com They list all the strains that are contained in the yoghurts/kefirs. It’s also a bit cheaper to order from them directly."
4,Lorelei,567,And Able answered the question already about the yeast in yoghurt/kefir:There are many types of yeast including beneficial yeast just as there are beneficial bacteria. Kefir contains beneficial yeast which can benefit the treatment against Candida yeast. There’s even a type of commercial probiotic yeast called S. boulardii.
5,JohnnyPonny,567,"Very good page, tnx for the link. Great that they have so good information on the content of there yogurts. Think Im going to ordere caspian and greek yogurt form them. *JohnnyPonny*"
6,Lorelei,567,"So I have been enjoying my Viili yoghurt now for a couple of days. (for a non yoghurt lover, this isn’t all that bad – with stevia added.) The first batch smelled and tasted very yeasty. I asked about it and was told this is airborne yeast from traveling and will dissipate with the next few batches. The second batch was indeed much better. I need to let the yoghurt sit much longer than recommended. (24 hrs instead of 18) but our house is pretty cool. Cream is recommended over milk to make a thicker yoghurt. And I wonder if cream would be better since it has less sugar. The organic cream I bought contains 0 g sugar per tbsp where the 1% org. milk contains 12 grams of sugar per cup which would equate to .75 g sugar per tbsp.- If you would eat a cup of yoghurt a day, there could be a significant difference in sugar you are NOT eating, if you made the yoghurt with cream only. Of course I don’t know how much of the sugar gets digested by the yoghurt cultures…."
7,JohnnyPonny,567,"Im trying out fil mjølk now. The batches I have made so far has been very thin in consistence. I used skimmed milk in the beginning but the last cup I added a tabel spoon of heavy cream, made a ticker consistense. The instruktion calls for heavy cream btw. Didn’t read them in the beginning. I read about processed whole milk in a book called “Nourishing traditions” author “Sally Fallon”. She explains that the fat in the milk isen’t good for you. I search the nett on it and found some back up info there. But that dosen’t make it true of course. So my sulution was to use skimmed milk with heavy cream added. Use about 2 tabel spoons of heavy cream on 1 cup skimmed milk. Skimmed milk and heavy cream is just pasteurized. *JP*"
8,JohnnyPonny,567,Gave up the fil mjølk. Hope that I will do bether with the caspian sea yogurt or viili culture. *JP*
0,kelandu,568,"hi everyone Im 10 months into the diet and seem to be going in circles. I follow the diet carefully but ive just discovered that the plamil chocolate ive been eaten contains caffeine, i had no idea.  Now im experiencing indigestion again. my nutritionist told me to stop taking vitamins and anti fungals 2 weeks ago and since then i feel it coming back. ( ive started them again today out of desperation I had also been drinking herbal teas, camomile, decaf green tea and peppermint tea and again just seen i shouldnt be drinking any of them. last month i felt well enough to have a treat, i had a curry takeaway. well never again! it took me weeks to get my energy to a point i could function again. I still havent reintroduced fruit because i know the candida is still not under control and im worried it will tip the balance.  Im really grateful to this site for educating us because its such a lonely journey to take when no one around you believes its a real illness. I wish you all well"
1,raster,568,What is your daily diet like? What kinds of supplements/vitamins are you taking?
2,kelandu,568,"Hi there I have red bobs gluten free cereal, its like porridge and rice milk for breakfast I eat salads with tomatoes, carrot juice gluten free/wheat free bread with butter  salmon, jacket potatoes, rice cakes with hummus, chicken, mince meat, stewing meat,  heres the part i think might be a problem I make pies with butter and gluten free/wheat free flour cakes with the same but also using stevia and ginger.carob snacks of pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds herbal teas candida clear, multivitamin with minerals, echincea, and vit c thats about it. if you can see i am missing something or doing somethin i shouldnt then i would appreciate any advice. thankyou )"
3,raster,568,"The problem is, while you have been doing the diet correct on some levels, you are still having plenty of bad items. The number one thing I’d cut is seeds. Seeds contain plenty of molds/fungi that really set you back. I had sunflower seeds the whole 4 months of my diet, and once I stopped I noticed a big improvement. The second thing I’d cut is butter. It is a dairy product and you are supposed to not have any dairy on the diet. A good alternative is coconut butter; it has the same texture and for me it fits the bill. Save the butter/dairy for the end of your treatment because it is not helpful at all. Tomatoes and carrots contain plenty of sugars; tomatoes are actually considered a fruit. Carrots are one of the most sugary vegetables that there is! Really reduce the amount of natural sugars you eat; it is best to keep it under 25g a day. Here is a site that shows the amount of sugars you eat per serving: http://www.sugarstacks.com/vegetables.htm http://www.sugarstacks.com/fruits.htm Gluten free is not the same as wheat free, sugar free, grain free, etc. Make some of the homemade breads that contain no bad ingredients. I saw some gluten free bread at the store and it had (gluten free) wheat, yeast, and honey! Not good for the anti-candida diet. Bob’s rice bran cereal is a good alternative because rice bran has the healthy part of the rice. Also, rice contains gluten! It has low gluten, but still…if possible replace it with buckwheat and save rice for phase 2. Buckwheat has the same texture and tastes very similar (and no gluten). Same with rice milk; cut it if possible. Are you eating any beef or pork? Beef and pork create ammonia in your gut, which is not helpful for the anti-candida diet. Stick to chicken, turkey, seafood if possible. I don’t know much about carob, but it is placed in the soy category. It sounds like it is starchy, which definitely isn’t good. http://my.clevelandclinic.org/disorders/allergies/hic_special_diets_for_food_allergies.aspx Other ideas: -Try the oil pulling (oral thrush post). -Try sweating out the toxins in a sauna, hot tub, steam room, etc. Hot bath works also. This helps remove toxins from body. -Get a good probiotic! Probiotics are the most important thing for the diet because you need to introduce good healthy flora to the gut. This will dramatically improve your health; the reason you have a candida problem is because there isn’t enough beneficial flora. If you can’t afford a probiotic, there are other ways to eat natural probiotic such as kefir. -Get a vitamin D/Zinc/Magnesium/Calcium vitamin and maybe stop the multivitamin.  -Get high quality vitamins in general that contain no soy, high amounts of cellulose, maltodextrin and other fillers. -Try some antifungals later in the diet. you can really waste a ton of money on these. -Undeceonic acid is very helpful for killing off the candida and can be taken long term. Very strong! -Contact a very good naturopathic doctor for a strong steady plan. Remember, they come like colors of of a rainbow, and they are good and bad ones. Look for one that has successfully treated candida numerous times. -Digestive grape bitters help your digestion and are really effective. Get one without alcohol if possible. Listen to some dr. mcoomb! http://www.mccombsplan.com/new/media_center/index.php We (the forum members) will get you back on track, and watch out because you’ll feel a ton better! Hope this helps! -Raster"
4,kelandu,568,"thankyou so much for taking the rime to reply and for the advice. looks like i need to rethink my entire diet but health is more important. I really thought i was doing well lol, i will have to find ways to survive without my favourite foods lol"
5,Able900,568,"Hello, Kelandu. Following Raster’s advice is a good plan, with a few extra suggestions thrown in. The Candida Clear is part of your problem, so are the multiple vitamins. The Candida Clear contains both rice flour and gum arabic. Gum arabic is a mixture of long and short-chain sugars plus glycoproteins. Gycoproteins are proteins which have sugars attached to them. I wouldn’t waste another dime on this product, and I would throw away whatever is on hand. Research has shown that Candida albicans are efficient at utilizing certain nutrients and supplements, especially synthetic B vitamin supplements which are usually in multiple vitamins. If your multiple vitamins contain even one B vitamin,  I would stop it right away. You could add avocados, rutabagas, turnips, kefir and homemade yogurt to your diet to make up for the foods you’re removing. All of these are antifungals in one way or another. The kefir/yogurt will also add beneficial bacteria to your system which is what you are lacking. The fact that the ‘curry takeaway’ took weeks for you to get over is a sure sign that the infestation is still in it’s pathogenic, aggressive state.  I don’t know which type of takeaway you had, but I’ve never seen a recipe for the curry sauce that didn’t contain flour. Your Candida had a feast that day. Able"
6,raster,568,You might also want to go onto an anti-inflammatory diet. Rice milk is one of the highest inflammatory almost good things you can eat for instance. Buckwheat is also slightly inflammatory. Check out your foods here: http://nutritiondata.self.com/ -Raster
7,bluemoonmaria,568,"Some good advice have been given. I will agree with the probiotics that are very essential. I started the diet one year ago but from poor diet symptoms came to come back. First day starting drinking acidophilus drink it really made a difference. I have noticed a lot difference on eating less and more quality food. It certainly make a difference to buy bio stuff, contain so less of that artificial things. Looking every single thing I buy what it contains it certainly makes a difference to me. Good luck with it."
8,raster,568,"Also, if you rotate what you eat every few days, the candida won’t be able to adapt to these foods as easily. For instance, if you ate nothing but buckwheat and chicken on the diet, the candida could eventually adapt to these foods and you will become allergic. You should consider rotating between buckwheat, quinoa, red and black rice, just to name a few. -Raster"

Im really grateful to this site for educating us because its such a lonely journey to take when no one around you believes its a real illness. I wish you all well Hi, I am going to give you some tips in another direction. Chronic candidiasis is associated to an acquired or genetic immune tolerance to the yeast/fungus. The goal of any treatment should be to reactivate proper immune function against it. It requires several things such as diet, antifungals, immune shots, supplements, and a detox program, specially addressing heavy metal toxicity. You can do an heroic effort following the most restrictive diet and taking antifungals, but, if you have a compromised immune system because mercury, lead, or any other offender is pushing your immune system toward to a humoral/th2 induced response, you never will get results. Cell-mediated immunity Th1/Th17 (specially IL-17) are very important to control intracellular pathogens such as fungus. Without this active immunologic response, it is impossible to cure a chronic fungal infection. Keep in mind the mycelial fungal form penetrates the cells and cause inflammation. You need an active cell-mediated immunity to clean the cells one time they are infected. Candida Albicans creates immune suppresor byproducts that can disrupt Th17 response. What I mean is you should look at any underlying cause that may be favoring the infection, specially those which affect the immune system. I hope this help you !"

14,dvjorge,568,"Able, I have seen you are very interested about everything linked to this syndrome. That is a good thing. There is nothing that has consumed more time to me since 2008 than research and study this syndrome. I have bought 16 books about it, have spent more than 3000 hours in the web researching medical papers about candida and everything linked to this illness, have more than 2000 posts in Curezone, spoken with candida “experts” Drs in person such as Dr. Crandall, Dr. M. McNett, and S.Barkley. It has been hard for me and the only focus of my life. I can tell you I still learn , and I am always open to new ideas and experiences. I have gained knowledge because the time reading and speaking with people affected by it but don’t claim to know more than anybody. I will be happy to share with you the information I have. I didn’t mentioned probiotics because current pharmaceutical probiotics CAN NOT colonize the gut permanently. There isn’t any grade pharmaceutical probiotic which do it. They colonize the gut temporary and only offer temporary benefits. Another important thing is the main gut enterotypes aren’t present in current probiotics. This means the antagonistic inhibitory flora isn’t mainly Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and E. Coli. Regarding to the intracellular candidiasis, it is what cause intestinal lining inflammation and leaky gut. It is one, if not, the worse part of this infection. Jorge."
0,shiiloh,569,"Okay, so last year I did this diet and it worked really well for me except that I got really skinny… therefore when I got back onto my normal diet I ate too many potatoes. My body is doing some of the things that it used to do, but not as bad. In saying that, I would like to go back again and do this diet properly! Any ideas at how to prevent getting too skinny? Any foods that will fill me up better? Oh. And I’m in New Zealand so some veges can be expensive! But up for ideas.."
1,Lorelei,569,"The first time I attempted the diet I lost 8 lbs in 1 week! (My weight averaged about 110 lbs.) The second time I started, I added in eggs from the start, ate at least one avocado a day and made a lot of egg or chicken salads with homemade mayo to add fat. I also started the coconut bread a week into the diet. (I think the recommendation is to wait for 2 to 3 weeks.) I now add a lot of coconut oil (at least 2 tsp on each slice of coconut bread) and only whole milk yoghurt (you need to wait with this too. Check the protocol/allowed foods list.) I actually look out for foods that have the good fats in them! The best recommendation I can give you is to start with a very filling breakfast. That sets the stage for the rest of the day. Browse the recipe breakfast ideas. My goto breakfast is an omelet with sauteed greens (kale, spinach with a sliced onion.) You saute the onion and greens, beat two eggs with herbs, pepper and salt. Add a chopped garlic clove to your sauteed veggies and poor the omelet mixture on top and bake until set. I eat this with mayo as well. Then if you are still hungry, you could have some avocado, coconut bread maybe or a side salad.  I still snack a lot between meals: kale chips, rutabaga, cauliflower, a bowl of guacamole, coconut bread with coconut oil. I also add at least one cooked veggie to my salad if I am not eating chicken or fish. For instance, a mixed greens salad with raw cauliflower and sauteed fennel on top is most delicious and much more filling than salad alone.  I’ve been able to keep my weight steady around 108 – 109. Good luck"
2,Lauren,569,"Lorelei, Great info! Thanks 😀"
3,shiiloh,569,Thanks Lorelei! I will use your advice when I start the diet again 🙂
4,raster,569,I recommend the following: 1)Eat 3-4 course meals if possible; add in some side dishes such as veggies or other ideas from allowed foods list. 2)Check out the teff/coconut flour/buckwheat flour recipe on the forum. Teff has great weight gaining properties. 3)Greek yogurt (plus kefir) 4)Chicken/lamb/buffalo sausages 5)Almond butter when you can handle it(I don’t think you are doing the stage 1 stage 2 thing) Also consider adding trace minerals to your diet because your body uses trace minerals to fight off candida. I lost 10-25 pounds on the diet and then I gained it all back. -raster
5,Lucylu,569,"Raster – when did you add almond butter? I’ve started introducing bits & pieces anad haven’t braved this yet. I also have pumpkin seed butter that I bought at the beginning not realising it was a no no. What do you think?

6,CT,569,"Hi, the first time I did the candida diet I initially lost lots of weight as well, I think I weighed about 96 pounds at one point. However, this time I have found the protocol on the forum very helpful because it shows which flours can be used to make bread which has helped keep weight on. Also I think what has been most helpful is making sure that the snack I have after work contains some sort of protein and so I am not starving by the time it is dinner time. For example I will eat chicken goujons or chicken burgers with chapati, or sardine pate with crisp breads. All these can be made in bulk and spread out through the week to save on time."

1,Able900,570,"Hello, Lauren. Quote: I am now having a hard time sleeping. But my energy level is great. Reply: It’s good that your energy level is up, but it would probably improve even more if you were getting enough sleep. Try to find a couple of supplements which can help with that problem. The first one is an herb called Ashwagandha which comes in capsule form. Take one at anytime during the afternoon and one at bedtime. In addition to the Ashwagandha, choose any of the following herbs; German Chamomile tea Valerian Root capsules or tea Lemon Balm in capsule form There’s also a mixture of herbs in a liquid form which has a good reputation for promoting sleep. It’s called “Deep Sleep” from Swanson products. http://www.swansonvitamins.com/HE104/ItemDetail?SourceCode=INTL402 You may be able to find this at Amazon as well. Quote: Also I been feeling like I need to throw up. Is this normal? There is a lot of burning in my stomach. I wondering if the acid is to low.. Reply: You’re right, the sick feeling can be attributed to low acid, for this you might consider trying Betaine hydrochloride (HCL) and follow the directions on the label. But you can also experience this from die-off symptoms. Are you taking a supplement of molybdenum yet? Quote: I have lost too much weight on the diet already. Reply: Losing too much weight while on the diet has only one cause; that is you’re not obtaining enough calories from the foods you’re eating. What you have to do is to simply add more calories to your diet, meaning you need to eat more of the foods that you’re allowed, otherwise, you’ll just continue to lose weight unless you at least meet your minimum daily requirements for calorie intake.

2,Lauren,570,"I actually have Ashwaganda in liquid form here at home so I will try that. I also heard that Valerian root would help. I feel better buying it now that you have said so too. I had some Betaine hydrochloride (HCL) but I ran out. Still I don’t think it the total problem. I think you are right that it is something from the die off because it feels different than it did in the pass when I ran out of HCL. I am taking molybdenum. 🙂 It seems to be helping with some of the die off symptoms. I will increase the amount of food as soon as I can. Right now its hard to eat one meal. But it only been like this for a day and a half. It is possible that it is a parasite that is giving me a hard time and in a couple days I will feel better to eat (because a parasite life is cyclical), though the problem wont be solved. Whatever the cause I will try to eat more and if the systems don’t go away I will speak to my doctor. Thanks again for responding. I really appreciate the time. Lauren"
3,raster,570,"Also in regards to the chamomile tea; do not steep it over 7-8 minutes or else it will do the opposite of making you tired; it will perk you up! If you steep it longer than that, it’ll give you too much energy. Other advice for sleeping problems: 1)Take a hot shower before bed 2)Start reading before bed 3)Participate in small activites like walking, jogging, biking, etc. Just burn up that extra energy some! Do something around the house that’ll take up energy. 4)Going to sleep and waking up same time of day can help treat insomnia. I will look up my homeopathic remedy for sleeping soon. -Raster"
4,Lauren,570,"Thanks Raster! As always your info is greatly appreciated. Also I have another question like always. 😀 The feeling of throwing up is getting pretty bad now. I cant eat and I am spending most of the day trying not to throw up. I slowed down the supplements I am taking. I actually have not taken much for the past two days. I thought this would help because maybe my body can not handle the toxins, but it is not. Also can I take molybdenum on an empty stomach? Able I know you said we could but my bottle of chelated molybdenum say it should be taken with food. So I just wanted to make sure. Thanks again Lauren"
5,Lauren,570,"Here are somethings that have helped me in the last day. These do not solve the problem but it seems to help. I am learning as I go through this.:D I stopped taking all my antifungals for the time being. This is because like Able said I am probably having to many toxins in my body from the die off. This concept confused me when I first found out about candida. I did not understand what die off meant or how it occurred so I will explain it if anyone else seems confused. Candida is a living organism. Just like all live organisms it eats and gives off waste. This waste is not healthy for the body, and there are 79 different toxins that Candida gives off. These can effect you brain, muscles, and body in general. One toxin that Candida gives off increase blood alcohol level. This is why most people with a candida problem experience brain fog. Another called acetaldehyde which effect the central nervous system. This could be why I have experience muscle twitching, and neropathy. So when you kill the candida through a cleanse or antifungals you experience worse symptoms. This is because candida, like all living organism, when killed releases all of it waste(the toxins). So even though the problem is getting better there is more toxins in your body at that time and you feel worse. This is why Molybdenum is very important. Any ways I should probably get back to what I was explaining :D. I also found that Aloe Vera Jucie has been very helpful for the feeling of having to throw up. This makes sense because Alo Vera Jucies helps to balance stomach acidity, It does not stop the feeling but it makes it less server. Make sure you buy one that is certified organic. My favorite brand is Lily of the dessert. Another thing that has helped is eating, even, though you don’t want to. Get something in your body. I know this is hard when you feel like throwing up. What I have done is drink gluten free, sugar free, organic free range chicken broth. It not a lot of calories but it is better than nothing. A brand I like is call Pacific Natural Foods. I also have success with getting a little coconut bread down. Hope this helps :), Lauren"
6,Lauren,570,"I am wondering if Molybdenum can give you a reaction of feeling sick to your stomach? Just because the timing in which I started this supplement is when I started to have stomach problems. It might just be a coincidence, but I am curious. Also on another thing I started taking antifungals again today because I thought my stomach could handle it. I had a very bad die off reaction. One of the worse in a very long time. Could that 3 day break of antifungals really give my candida a chance to grow? I stuck to the diet when I could get food down.  Thank you for all replies, Lauren"

Thank you for all replies, Lauren Hi Lauren, thank you for sharing your story and your knowledge. Just now I am sitting here sick to my stomach and a feeling I have to throw up. Everything you described about the toxins from candida where helpful reading again. In the battle one forgets and wonders. These toxins are very powerful and cause so many different sympthoms that one starts to doubt oneself and looses the trust in healing. Especially when people tell and think its only in the head. Or have a face expression, sorry pal, shit happens. I dont have much to say but thank you for your letter, it helped me somehow knowing that there is actually a brotherhood, I am not alone in that mess. all the best to you Thomas"
8,Downtown,570,"Lauren, Ginger root/Ginger root extract is a great supplement for upset stomach. Among its many other healing properties, ginger root is commonly used for motion sickness, nausea, etc. I can personally attest to its use for nausea.

Lauren, I read another post where you stated that you had “chelated Molybdenum” but only 150 mcg, so how much are you taking in a day and do you take it every single day? The reactions were much more than likely from the antifungals (die-off) and not the Molybdenum. This mineral is already naturally in your body, so it’s not as if you aren’t used to it already. Able"
10,Lauren,570,"Thanks Able for responding! I am taking molybdenum of 150 twice a day. I take it every day. I was thinking about taking it three times a day. My stomach issues have passed at least for now. I am still not taking as much of the antifungals as I normally do because right now I am just trying to get some weight on. I am now down to 111 pounds and I don’t want to be that small, but I am sure that will fix itself because I am trying to eat as much as possible. Tomorrow will be the first day I am going to be on my full amounts of anti fungals. Thanks  Lauren"
11,Able900,570,"Lauren, during the worse die-off periods you can easily take 750 mcg a day. That means that you can take 5 of yours spread throughout the day. This is the amount I would take to keep the toxins under control and lessening the chance of the aldehydes causing damage to the liver. You don’t have to take all of the antifungals at one time, you can stagger the different antifungals and take just two during one period of time. Able"
12,Lauren,570,"Thanks Able!! Your reposes are always appreciated.  I will up my amount that I am taking. I am in the processes of finishing my candi gone product from renew life (which contains the antifungals outlined here plus more) and switching over to the supplements outlined here. This is why I am taking a lot of antifungals at one time. I know that the protocol here for supplements is better and I started to implement some of it already. It makes sense to change the antifungals like stated here so the candida does not get use to a certain combination (like what is in the candi gone) since it is a opportunistic organism. Also the ability to slowly up the dosage of antifungals is the safest for your body (instead of a certain amount you need to take for the candi gone). It is just I want to finish the product I bought already because I don’t want to waste money and I know the product is helping, just not as good as it could. If I did not think Candi Gone product was good I would not be taking it, but I feel it is a good product for most people, just not the best.  Thanks  Lauren"
13,Lauren,570,Thank you Downtown! I will keep ginger in mind. 😀
14,Lauren,570,Thomas thank you for those kind words 🙂 You have been a help to me know that someone else has also experienced this. Thank you for posting. Lauren
0,Lauren,571," Able or Raster I have been trying to find your post on Fiber. I need to find one that is FOS free, that is gluten, dairy, wheat, yeast free and that has both soluble and insoluble fiber. I need one that is FOS free because I recently had citrobacter species bacteria and it eats on FOS. Also I need one with soluble and insoluble fiber. This is because soluble fiber absorbs the toxins and insoluble fiber sweeps the colon. These are both important when doing a cleanse. I also would like to find one with flax seed in it since this is also very beneficial. I just don’t know if there is one out there. I have been searching and have not found one. But I hoping that you have. You have helped me a lot already! Thanks for your time, Lauren"
1,raster,571,"Well, I think you may have the wrong idea on FOS. FOS is actually very important for healing leaky gut and fighting candida in general. FOS foods help tremendously with digestion. Here is a link about FOS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide -raster"
2,Lauren,571,"Raster I agree with FOS for anyone else beside me. I think FOS is very beneficial, just not for me. I personally had a bacteria that eats FOS so I should avoid it at all cost."
3,Able900,571,"Lauren wrote: I personally had a bacteria that eats FOS so I should avoid it at all cost. Lauren, which bacteria is that and how did you find out?"
4,Lauren,571,"Able900 wrote:I personally had a bacteria that eats FOS so I should avoid it at all cost. Lauren, which bacteria is that and how did you find out?  Hi Able! I got a Comprehensive Stool Analysis (CSA) done and I had high levels of three bad bacteria they are 3+ Citrobacter braaki, 3+ Citrobacter freundii 4+ Proteus mirabillis. When I mentioned these results to Brenda Watson she stated:  “FOS is a fruit sugar that is also a fiber and is generally very helpful in the gut. It’s something called a pre-biotic. Your reason to avoid FOS has to do with your particular Stool Analysis test results that you mentioned which showed 3+ Citrobacter braaki, 3+ Citrobacter freundii. That is a particular strain of bacteria that happens to like to eat FOS.” I took Ciproflaxcin to help get ride of these bacteria. This is because the lab tested 3+ Citrobacter braaki, 3+ Citrobacter freundii and found that it was resistant to many things but not Ciproflaxacin. However because how strong these bacteria are I am suppose to try and avoid FOS. But I have not been able to find one that has everything I need and that has not FOS. This test is also where I confirmed that I had a yeast overgrowth. It was shown up as many yeast in all three stool sample that I gave. I am currently getting another test done by metamrix to see how I have progressed and if they can find any parasites. Here is a link to the original test I got done. http://www.labtestingdirect.com/test-kits/item/?pid=625 Here is a link to the Metametrix test I am getting done currently: http://www.metametrix.com/test-menu/profiles/categorized (The one GI Effects Mycology Profile – Stool) Thank you as always Lauren"

It is very difficult to balance all the diets. I too might have a high amount of histamin a situation called histaminose. A diet low on histamine again would cut the food allowed to an even lower level. Has someone found a balance yet? cheers Thomas"
9,Lauren,571,"Raster, I hope the test helps you! 😀 The problem has been for me is now that I know the problem how do I find a doctor that knows about this stuff. It seems like I know more about these issues than many doctors. The alternative doctor I see now knows about the candida diet,which is a plus, but I still feel I have more info about candida than her. She been great helping me check for other other problems but not so great to help solve the candida problem I have. It like she is learning from me, not the other way around. But thankfully I have this website. I cant wait until the day when all doctors know about candida and understand it is a health problem. Can you imagine when people will be able to get help through their problems without spending tons of time researching it themselves. To think that many of us would not had to go through test after test, felt discouraged because no one would believe you or knew how to help, and would have a road map on how to get better. I have a question like always. 😀 Brenda Watson feels there are cases (very few but some) where medicine is needed to get someone better. That their gut is so unbalanced and their candida infestations is so bad that you need natural antifungals with prescriptions. Do you agree? And if that is the case how do you find a doctor who knows enough about it, when the doctors that are alternative don’t even know enough? Thanks and hope you are all feel wonderful, Lauren"
10,raster,571,"Well, I don’t know what kind of medication would make you better lauren. You can get pharmaceutical grades of probiotics or antifungals, but these likely won’t be as good as other ones we recommend on the forum. I do not feel that medication can help anyone with their candida problem because it doesn’t heal you and doesn’t address the root cause of the problem. I feel that supplements, vitamins, and diet can heal a person just as well. Question: “how do you find a doctor who knows enough about it, when the doctors that are alternative don’t even know enough?” Answer: Well, you may have just not found a good doctor that knows enough about candida to help you along. I found a naturopathic doctor in my town who has taught me a ton and I still learn from him about how the body works. He introduced me to SF722, HMF neuro, and a bunch of other supplements that are really helping me get better and make progress. He has clients/customers around the world and sends them packages; from Brazil to China. He treats you and not the candida. Examples: I recently started to take a mineral vitamin called min-tran which contains iodine. This helps me with my “need to go urinate” problem in the night when I sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night often when I need to go. He also prescribed me another similar supplement that in general helps me sleep really solid. I have had chronic insomnia for over 10 years and I finally am getting level 4 sleep for the first time in many years. I also had a problem with gas after eating protein throughout my treatment. He introduced me to zypan which not only completely eliminated my gas problem, but it healed my body by giving me minerals as well. Now I don’t need to take zypan because I do not have a gas problem anymore; the minerals have been absorbed and I am healed. I look at my doctor as a “witch doctor” someone who busts out these random things I have never heard before that are very effective. While I did do a fairly good job learning myself, I feel that he knows a ton more than I ever would about people’s health and how the body works. Just ranting here… -Raster"

Although I haven’t found any research that would suggest malabsorption leads to candida. I can understand the confusion of symptoms I orginally tried the diet 1 year and half ago and had to stop to find out what was causing the other symptoms as I felt that they were holding me back from getting better while on the candida diet."
12,Lauren,571,No problem CT! It was good information none the less 😀
0,YeastMan,572,"I have been fighting off some form of mild, but persistent yeast infection for about 5 months. Tried everything to get rid of it. Recently, I have looked into the candida diet and realized that the diet is really just a more restrictive low-carb diet. I have had past experience doing a “healthy” form of low-carb/Atkin’s diets, so what came as a surprise were a few things on the “bad” list that make it unnecessarily restrictive: cheese, alcohol and mushrooms. The logic behind these being prohibited is completely wrong. All of these should be okay to eat… in moderation. Here is why:  Candida albicans: consumes monosaccharides (sugars). Produces acetaldehyde and alcohol as a byproduct of metabolism. Cheese – on a low-carb diet, cheese is accepted as a low-carb, moderate protein, high calorie alternative. There are few carbohydrates in cheese for candida to metabolize. The layman’s logic that mold grows on it, so it must support candida is faulty. Mold consumes starch, cellulose, lignin (sugars), just like candida. Mold/candida, both consume the sugar in the cheese – not everything else (protein/fat). The good doctor here agrees about eating cheese. It is extremely difficult to survive on a low-carb diet without cheese as one of the ingredients, unless you are replacing it with massive quantities of unhealthy butter, bacon or other fatty foods. It is also difficult to get enough calcium in your diet without it. Put cheese back on the menu! Alcohol – Alcohol is generally considered bad on a low-carb diet and bad on candida. Atkin’s restricts you to 20g carb/day. However, this is mainly, because alcoholic drinks often contain a ton of carbohydrates:  -1 Mixed drink – Boatload of carbs -1 Ale averages about 15 carbs -1 Beer averages about 10 carbs -1 Glass of wine averages about 4 carbs -1 Shot of hard liquor has none See where I am going? Drinking hard liquor (shots) should be perfectly fine on the candida diet. Even better, since the objective is to avoid a yeast infection and not to lose weight (1g of alcohol has ~7 empty calories). A single class of wine or one low-carb beer (Mich. Ultra, Miller Lite or regular Bud Select) per day is also doable. Good mixed drinks are diet vodka tonics and diet Redbull vodkas. Also, the idea that beer has yeast, candida=yeast so alcohol must be bad is total garbage. As mentioned earlier, one of the byproducts of candida’s metabolism is alcohol. This means that it lacks the enzymes necessary to convert alcohol/ethanol further. You and I possess these things called “livers” that contain the enzymes necessary to metabolize alcohol. Candida and brewer’s yeast don’t. Just know the carb content of beer you are drinking. Mushrooms – Mushrooms have about zero calories and zero carbs. There is nothing for candida yeast to eat! On top of that, I have read that different fungi have natural anti-fungals to each other. I don’t know if this is true, but I have not seen any mushroom cannibalism. Of course, some people are going to come along with their sample size of 1 and anecdotally claim that they started eating cheese/doing shots/gobbling shrooms and their candida came back like crazy. Sorry guys, but the science does not support it. Quit torturing yourselves and start allowing cheese, alcohol and mushrooms into your diet!"
1,MyButterflyEffect,572,"I really wish that what your saying is true. When I first started to follow the Candida diet I thought that I could get away with drinking some vodka on the weekends since it was low carb, distilled, had no yeast, malt, etc. I felt awesome when I first started drinking, like I could have a piece of a normal life back. A few hours after drinking I’d feel like I poisoned myself. My stomach would feel bloated, my blood sugar fluctuated, my circulation and sleep would be altered. The next day my cravings for food would be out of control. More than anything I think that alcohol just added more toxins to my body and knocked down my immune system. Our bodies are already strained due to the Candida, alcohol is just one more toxic thing that it has to filter and process.YeastMan wrote: Of course, some people are going to come along with their sample size of 1 and anecdotally claim that they started eating cheese/doing shots/gobbling shrooms and their candida came back like crazy. Sorry guys, but the science does not support it. Quit torturing yourselves and start allowing cheese, alcohol and mushrooms into your diet! I work at an Allergy office and administer a lot of the allergy testing. Almost all of the people that have Candida have some sensitivity to molds, yeast, fungus, and any fermented food. -I wish that I had more time to type a better response. Hopefully you will be able to add those 3 foods into your diet without any problems. Good luck with everything."
2,dvjorge,572,"What kind of benefit can you get drinking alcohol during an anti-candida protocol ?? Do you want to add more load to your liver ?? Does the alcohol is providing you with some specific nutrient that you lack ?? Are you considering that cheeses have lactose and casein ?? Lactose feed the fungus. Casein is a high allergen that contributes to intestinal inflammation. What the other poster said is correct, people who suffer CRC are allergic to molds, fungus, yeasts, etc. This syndrome isn’t only an overgrowth but a hypersensitivity syndrome too. By the way, if I were followed Lawrence Wilson’s treatment, I were probably already death. Jorge."
3,Able900,572,"The logic behind these being prohibited is completely wrong. Your science is right on, but you have no idea as to what the logic actually is. Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end. "
4,YeastMan,572,"@MyButterflyEffect Thanks for your response. Alcohol does mess with your blood sugar levels and sleep cycle, as you probably know. Alot of it may be just psychological, though. Not encouraging people to drink more alcohol, but just trying to give people the option. It makes the diet more tolerable if people realize they can have a drink and socialize with friends, once in awhile. If mushrooms are triggering an allergic response, then I can see the logic in keeping them off the menu. My understanding was that the immune system was failing to recognize candida as a threat, though. @dvjorge – there is little lactose/carbs in cheese remaining – that’s the whole point. Bacteria converts the lactose in milk into lactic acid – that’s what makes it cheese! As for casein, you would know if you are allergic to casein already and there are many allergens out there. No sense in avoiding healthy proteins. As said before, alcohol is not necessary, but makes life easier and the diet more likely to be followed. I appreciate that some of you may be suffering from far worse symptoms than I am and good luck to all."
5,Javizy,572,"I’m not against a sociable drink, but alcohol is a toxin. It produces aldehydes and free radicals which damage arteries and the liver, dehydrates our cells, and affects the digestive tract in such a way that undigested proteins are more likely to pass into the body through a leaky gut. Even one of these things is a good enough reason to avoid it for the entirety of the diet, and I’m sure there are plenty of other downsides you could add to that list. If you’re mixing caffeine (Red Bull) with alcohol, you might as well just eat some chocolate gateau for all the good it’ll do your guts and your progress. Healing from candida and digestive issues is a lot more complicated than carb-counting. As for cheese, maybe unaged (white) cheeses with the lowest sugar content could be tested a bit later on, since they would be a good source of macronutrients and shouldn’t contain any moulds. I’d rather avoid dairy as much as possible though, and I wouldn’t call the poorly metabolised fats contained in cheese “healthy”. Dairy certainly isn’t necessary for health, even if we’re brainwashed into believing our bones will snap without a sugar-packed glass of skimmed-milk that doesn’t have the fat content to allow us to digest the fat-soluble vitamins anyway! The majority of the world’s population gets by just fine without it."

The coconut nectar is a nectar and the GI rated as a 35. So personally I would not use this product. As for the stevita I would have to do more research because the website does not have enough information. Great job being creative though. Regular Stevia I feel is the safest way to go :D. You want to stay away from items that are high in GI. This is because if the GI is high it means the carbohydrates ability to raise blood sugar level is high, which is not good since Candida eats sugar. For more info about GI you can visit this website. http://www.glycemicindex.com/about.php Hope this helps, Lauren"
0,christopher marcus,575,Under phase 2 of the diet there are a number of antifungals etc that should be taken as the introduction to other foods after the detox phase. The question I need to have answered is: do I continue to take the supplements from the detox during the phase 2? Help p-lease!

0,Thomas,578,"Hi raster!  you said that you had a bad case of leaky gut. I am pretty sure that I am in the same boat. I was checking the internet on leaky gut and diets to help it, and in several was total no no for the kefir and all milk products. I wonder now how it was with you and kefir, how did you get your intestine to heal even drinking Kefir.   Could you please write us a outline for healing the leaky gut problem. I have to stop again to drink Kefir because I feel quite bad again. It really sucks because I feel in a way its doing me good and then I get these reactions. Thanks Thomas"
1,raster,578,"Well, if kefir is a problem for your gut, I would switch to solely using a probiotic. I have never had kefir, so am unsure what problems it could do to the gut. I take a homeopathic that is primarily used to heal my leaky gut. However, foods high with FOS can heal the gut as well. If you get a product called inulin (miracle fiber), you can add it to your foods such as coconut bread and it will help heal the gut also. The homeopathic I took is called digestive enzyme liquidscence, however I do not think it’ll be easy to find it on the internet or even a vitamin store. I got it prescribed to me by my naturopath doctor and don’t recommend the use of homeopathic medicine because I am not a doctor myself. However, any bitters is an alternative way to heal the gut, and you should try to get some if possible. Orange bitters, lemon bitters, spanish bitters, swedish bitters, grape bitters all work. I wouldn’t worry too much about any small amount of alcohol found in the bitters because your body should be able to recover and get past any negatives in the alcohol. -Raster"

Which food is high on FOS? I am following the diet plan stage 1 from you and able here on the forum. Raster how did you read your symptoms when you where still sick? some of the reactions are good because we kill the candida, but the same symptoms can be read as a inflammation and allergic reaction of the gut. Lets say you eat garlic, and get a heavy reaction with dizziness and stomach pain, itching skin in eyes and anus, pain in the muscles, spasms in the bladder and diarrhoea. Was it now a good reaction, meaning we did a heavy blow to the candida, and a heavy die-off which means keep going with it as we are killing off the enemy?! Analyse of the situation would lead to:  Plan of action eat garlic. Or does it tell me. Stop with it, you are putting something in your system you are allergic too and your weak and leaky gut cant handle, he needs to heal and gets a rest. Plan of action: Stop eating garlic! I have the same battle in my mind with all the food, like the wonderful coccus bread. I love it, and eat it with eggs or avocado salat. After it I am having a little dizziness and very little stomach pain. Here again the same game of confusion, I stick it through until the candida is starved to death or I stop with that too because its an reaction for a wounded gut? I have the feeling that this is the only and most profound problem I still have. There is no hunger, no needing of anything nothing, I am all content with everything only that dam confusion about the way to battle on different front lines and different symptoms. Kefir and yoghurt is great in the battle against candida, its great too for building up a good intestines flora so I should and want to eat it a lot. But the wounded and out of shape guts cant handle them. Do you get a picture of my confusion? thanks a lot! yours thomas"
3,Able900,578,"Hello, Thomas The “coccus” bread sounds interesting. Do you make this yourself or purchase it premade? Here’s a rundown of the different symptoms you described and a general explanation of what each represents. dizziness – Of course this can be a symptom of Candida, but when you’ve been on the treatment for several weeks, it’s normally a die-off reaction. Stomach pain is a symptom of both Candida and die-off. However, when you experience stomach pain followed by diarrhea it’s more than likely being caused by die-off. Diarrhea is usually a die-off symptom. At this stage of the treatment, pains in the muscles are associated more with die-off than the Candida itself. Itching skin and eyes are more than likely linked to allergies caused by the leaky gut syndrome. Itching around the anus can be caused by Candida or other pathogens. There is a way to test whether these are caused by die-off or not, and at the same time, lessen the die-off symptoms. Simply stop all antifungals for about five days but remain strictly on the Candida diet. If the symptoms cease, then they were probably being caused by die-off, if they do not, then the cause was probably the Candida.

8,Ashlay,578,"I am also suffering from leaky gut, as gluten, milk and other foods were causing me realy problems. Check out this product, (i dont know if its available to ship to your location) Marshmallow FormulaThe product formerly called “Leaky-G-Herb”. Before reading the information below, please note that healing a genuinely leaky gut takes several months, though the process may be speeded up by with addtional products such as Threelac, Golden Seal Formula E or F and Colostrum. An excessively permeable intestinal mucosa (“leaky gut”) is a major cause of food allergies since it permits the passage of undigested food proteins and peptides into the blood stream, where they provoke an allergic response. A leaky gut also greatly facilitates autointoxication from the bowel, and we believe this to be a major and common cause of unwellness and disease. A prime cause of a leaky gut is Candida (it also results from alcoholism.) Supposedly Candida physically damages the intestinal mucosa, though our work suggests another mechanism is frequently operative: acetaldehyde produced by Candida weakens the mucosa by free-radical activity. Certainly a leaky gut is invariably a concomitant of candidiasis, and specific measures must be undertaken to deal with it. Occasionally food allergies disappear when Candida is eradicated, presumably because a burden is removed from the immune system, but more commonly they do not disappear until healing of the leaky gut occurs. Although there may be some spontaneous healing once Candida is eliminated (particularly if irritant foods such as sugar are being avoided, and if vitamins and minerals are being supplemented, especially vitamin A and zinc), this is best not left to chance and we recommend that Marshmallow Formula be started about four months after anticandidal therapy is started and maintained for several months. The manufacturers report that they once saw a hyperactive boy who had 19 food allergies (based on kiniesiology testing) when they first saw him, 13 of which were severe, to whom they gave Goldenseal Formula followed by Marshmallow Formula. After using these products he had only six allergies, four of which were mild and two of which were insignificant, so there is no doubt that food allergies can be resolved. It was also speculated that if this boy’s digestive system were supported, these residual allergies would fade too."

Of course, a person who is overweight and goes on the diet is likely to lose the weight easier and probably faster than someone who is underweight, at least I would hope so. It also depends on how much of the foods allowed a person is willing to eat, some people don’t care for it that much so they eat a very small amount compared to the amounts they’re used to. I don’t think it’s that unusual for a person to lose a total of 30 pounds on the diet. Able"

Read the protocol here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Nobody can tell you how long it will take for you to heal.

Kefir is very beneficial for your health and organic greek yoghurt too. They are very low in sugar but have lots of probiotics.  You need to get the supplements Able suggested too.

Reply: The detox is not as important to the treatment as the first phase diet is. Otherwise, this is something that’s impossible to foresee with anyone at all, even oneself.

3,dendel30,582,Thank you so much for getting back to me! I have taken both your advice on board and ready to start it tomorrow…Cant wait 🙁 Thanks again!
4,Jackie2,582,I too am a teacher and found the diet to be very easy to follow as a teacher. I would not start with Phase 2!! Stick with phase 1 you will see improvement. You need to do a search at the top of the forum here and find oil pulling. For the sores in your mouth…I had oral thrush awful due to antibiotics. The antifungals perscribed by doctor made very little dent after 1 full week. I got on diet and started oil pulling and immediate relief. It took much time to heal my mouth. My ordeal in my mouth started on November 15th and I’m still fighting it daily. Every time I step off the diet a very small bit I see an imediate reaction in my mouth. The other very important step in this process is to DRINK TONS of WATER. I’m always drinking hot lemon water in my classroom…all day long. I drink at least 8 bottle sof water and 6 glasses of lemon water. For lunch I packed a salad with lemon as my dressing. I have now moved to making ACV/olive oil/garlic dressing and also enjoy that but I did not start that till later in the diet. Keep it simple and watch what you eat. I have a fealing your mouth will let you know what is good and what is hurting you. I have tried certain things like a rice cracker and feel burning on my tongue and lips. I wanted things too bad too early and had set backs. Just take your time. Let your body heal. I’m not where I want to be yet…but I sure enjoy where I am than where I was in November. Best of luck to you..and listen to Raster and Able…they are wonderful Jackie
5,raster,582,"One thing I suggest is to not put a timetable for your recovery. It could take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from a candida overgrowth. Considering this, you need to kill off the candida as well as possible during phase 1 of the diet. If you do phase 2 instead, the candida will still be able to grow. You would just simply be allowing the candida to grow and die over and over again. It will set things back some and it just isn’t good enough. How do I know? I started phase 2 before phase 1 first thinking the same thing… -Raster"
6,dendel30,582,"Ok, so your going to be ashamed at this but i started off well (ish) had hot lemon and water for my breakfast along with a few almonds, for lunch I had spinach, egg, onion,plum tomotoe, avocado. hot lemonn. By two o clock i had horrific headache and i felt so emotional, I had to stop myself from crying twice, but eventually let it out just for minute and not in front of the kids (ha ha that would not of gone down well). Now I know its nothing to do with food as Im not a huge eater anyway so I dont know whether it was first day back to work (ha!) or wondered if its to do with lack of sugar/caffene (would drink three cups of coffee a day) I even considered getting a pregnacy test as I have never felt so out of sorts. Anyway I skipped college as I was too tired and as soon as I came home had a big bowl of brown pasta and fish and surprise surprise two cups of coffee, almost immediately felt better, emotionally and headache, which scares me as the candida must be a big problem within me. Please tell me others have experienced this!! I will start again tomorrow"
7,kirstyk4,582,"I was VERY emotional my first several weeks on the diet. There were times when I was so angry or sad that I would cry all day. It didn’t take much to set me off. I also felt like I was never going to be successful in anything (no matter what I was doing and how good I actually was at it). The fact that you felt so badly after starting the diet could be some die off you were experiencing. Die off is uncomfortable for a while, but it will slowly go away as you kill off the candida. Although the rice and coffee likely put you back to where you were before the diet. The cravings are another thing that are REALLY bad in the beginning. I used to think about the food I couldn’t have for most of the day. Now I don’t…but it doesn’t mean I don’t still miss those foods on occassion and sharing them with family and friends. Keep your chin up and take it a day at a time. This is probably one of the hardest things I have done for myself, but it will be worth it in the end! Hope this helps! Kirsty"
0,Jeremiah,583," Joined: 1/6/2012 Posts: 0 Location: Kirkland, Wa. USA Hi, I’m new and 60 in a month, a vegan, and a long time natural foods, supplement and herb buff, learned from my deceased naturopathic dad, but still am plagued with candida, from a youth being in swimming pool too much and getting ear infections, which they dealt with, you guessed it, a ton of antibiotic shots. When I started drinking a lot of beer in college I broke out with a mess of these huge pimples on my back and face. Yeast was then my enemy, and reading alot about candida in the 80’s and 90’s, always think I have it under control until it comes back. I eat only twice a day, being a meditator, which knocks down your appetite, and with a protein shake in the AM, and a tube pasta (filler) with a bunch of orgainic steamed vege’s, and orgainic thick vege soups; you’ve seen them, Pacific and Imagine in a 16 oz. box., and for the last 8 mo.’s, 4 ea. organic vegan cinnamon oatmeal raisin cookies. My candida has come back big time. My questions for the experts are: 1.The vegan cookies are made with Florida Crystals Sugar (dehydrated cane juice), but otherwise darn near healthy, but how bad is the dehydrated cane juice for feeding candida, I also use Stevia in my tea and water (make my own qt. distilled water w/ baking soda to put the ph to 9.0, and my own trace minerals and a dropper of Stevia – 3 qts daily. 2. The penne small tube pasta as a filler for the thick vege soup has sugar in the carbs, too much? 3. Stress is always an issue with money so tight? Worry 4. Is eating this regime but doing daily molybdenum, milk thistle, lemon in my water, and grape bitters enough to stabilize this menu? Thanks"
1,Jeremiah,583,"This is an addition to my own topic, because this is such of an old nemissis of mine, and your forum with very knowledgeable experts, have me thinking of questions to add that have developed over the years.  To clarify, my meditation of 2 and 1/2 hrs daily, keeps my appitite way down and because you become so devoted to your Master, being a vegan is very little to give in comparison. Now however with candida back and for 8 years now my limitations from foods due to my vegan diet have me seaching for a happy mediun so as I can eat pasta, or potatoes, as again its filling capacity to the stomach satisfies the appitite of a vegan. So what I guess I don’t understand is, if a person were to detox and kill all the overgrowth of unnecessary yeast, can they then go back to the pasta diet or can the pasta diet run in conjuction with the antifungals? So to simplify the sugars in pasta, are they manageable with antifungals if your a vegan and do really have a lot of choide when it comes to heavy foods to fill the palete, or potates in moderation, and sugars, you now have Florida crystals that all the vegan pastry shops are using because they have to use a egg replacer and organic ingredients, so they look to the only close to healthy sugar, a cane juice that is dehydrated and formed into crystals called Florida Crystals. Still I know the sugar is there and needs to be controlled if not stopped, but the question is again the control or stop. Stevia is glycemically ok, so how much worse is cane juice that hasn’t been processed with chemicals, and then of course vegetable carbs. Is it quantity and quality of the sugar if clean and no chemicals, or just flat no sugar until the yeast is balanced and then moderate? My dad cured his cancer at Hippocrates in San Diege while a vegan with chlorophyll under the fact that the body when as a whole detoxified can heal anything. You detox the colon walls, and let the lymph move through the walls of the intestines, and clean the blood with chlorophyll, and the body will cure anything. My dad was vegan and people said, see a vegan can get cancer. Well his colon was perfect with plenty of fiber taken, but his blood had some latent chemicals that hid in the fat cells from him getting acid burns on his hands while dalic plating the Nike Missle Cones at Aerojet when I was a kid, and after he went down to 125 lbs at 6/2″, he looked dead and once detoxing at Hippocrates for 3 weeks started gaining weight and in 6 months was back and these huge purple skin patches came out all over his body and they found them to be the same chemical he used 20 years before. 2 hospitals wanted to know what he had done as they told him nothing could be done and he would answer their questions, and he lived for 35 more years till 86. Once the alkalinity of the blood is barely above normal, your basically untouchable. Most people don’t know you can make your own water by putting a 1/4 tsp of baking soda, sodium bicarbonate, and bring the ph up to 9 with just a 1/4 tsp. and them put your own trace minerals in and you’ve got the best water you can drink. Don’t get the RO (reverse osmossis water) as the screen takes out everything which so does distilled, but with sweating the water and removing even the slightest amt. of bacteria. Then I personally put in some liquid magnesium for extra magnesium, always depleted and some oxygen water and stevia for taste and 3 qts. a day in the winter isn’t hard to drink. Alkalinity is the way to go. If the body is alkaline even yeast can’t get over balanced. Whew I’d better stop. I love your site, it reminds me of DCC.com, if anybody wants to learn about cat food from a great vet. You’ll never by dry cat food again. The site educates you, like yours does, which is absolutely perfect, and then shows you how through their forum how to rid your cat from diabetes, 90% or the time. My cats diabetes was 450 and now he hasn’t had any insulin for 2 years. The carb fillers of grain, when they had surplusses in the 30’s and 40’s were put in with overcooked food and the outcome was dead food with no enzymes and some much sugar from grains the pancreas stopped working and therefore got diabetes. I cured my cat in 3 weeks on a special insulin, checked his ears to get his blood glucose count and off a sliding scale gave special insulin watching daily the GC go down until I literally watched the pancreas wake up. Cool. Well its great to be on board. To tired to edit so I hope this is readable. Thanks for showing up. Jeremiah"
0,Summer,584,What is the consensus on Tru Via.  I’ve been consuming about a packet a day (I’m in the cleanse phase)  It helps me choke down psylium but I don’t want to be consuming anything that will derail me. What are your thoughts and experiences with Truvia?

3,Able900,584," Truvia can actually be tested a few weeks after starting the phase 1 diet. Garbanzo beans or any beans for that matter are not usually introduced until at least the second half of phase one, but if you think you’ll doing that great, go ahead and test themm but be sure to watch for a reaction. Note that on the forum we refer to the stages as such: Detox period – 1 to 2 weeks Stage One – 3 to 18 months Stage Two – Length depends on outcome. Able"
4,Summer,584,"Abel,  Whats the thought on all beans. I didn’t see them on the avoid list or the foods to eat list.  I read somewhere that they can cause discomfort in people with IBS like candida symptoms.  I don’t have any of these so should I be good to go with Garbanzo?  Or do you believe it is just better to wait because I can hold out 3 weeks if it will be better for me in the long run. Thanks,  S-"
0,bradleywinkler,585,"Hello everyone, My wife and I have just started the cleanse phase of our war on candida (we are doing it together because we both show various different symptoms, especially since we were on antibiotics for a fair bit of time while traveling in Asia several years back). Just over 24 hours in, she is fine but I’m experiencing a severe case of nausea and vomiting. Is it possible that this is a symptom of die-off happening to me already? Or is it more likely a reaction to what I’m putting into my body? I should state that I have a very fast metabolism; I typically cannot fast for any length of time because I go into a hypoglycemic crash — I get very lethargic and my brain fogs over. So I saw doing the cleansing fast as a challenge that would be difficult for me. After watching the movie “Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead” we decided to incorporate juicing into our general diet, and use it as part of our cleanse (we intended to just do juice for the long holiday weekend, and start incorporating solids back in tomorrow evening). Just got the juicer, and started using it yesterday when we began our cleanse. We started the juice fast yesterday afternoon after a last solid meal in the morning. I was OK last night and this morning; this afternoon things really started to get difficult, with lethargy and general feeling of malaise. And suddenly as of about 5pm, I’m tossing my cookies — figuratively; I haven’t cheated at all, really! Here’s what I’ve eaten since yesterday morning: Yesterday, 10am: A detox drink with psyllium power and bentonite clay (I subsequently read the post on this forum about these being bad, and have stopped them) Noonish: A 2-egg omelette with pork, cup of orange juice, various vitamins and other usual supplements — using up some leftovers in the interest of not wasting expensive food 5pm: First pint of green juice (lemon, lime, celery, cucumber, green pepper, kale, chard, parsley, green onion, ginger, garlic) 10pm: A detox drink as recommended in this forum, of lemon juice (juiced a whole lemon, rind and all) in water, plus a milk thistle and vitamin C w/bioflavonoids Today, 10am: Another lemon juice detox drink 11am: Pint of green juice 12-3pm: Several pints of club soda with lime (hey, you go to a bar to watch football, you have to buy something even if you’re on a cleanse, right?) 4pm: Detox drink, this time with lime 5pm: Quarter cucumber with salt, because I was getting so hungry I couldn’t stand it any longer And shortly thereafter, suddenly I got nauseous and threw up for the first time. It was very acidic, with the lime juice clearly in evidence (sorry to get graphically gross). Feeling the need to settle my stomach, I then drank about 4oz of whole milk (organic, grass-fed, raw), and threw up again in fairly short order. Since then I haven’t ingested anything but water and a bit of peppermint tea (supposed to be good for settling the stomach), but am continuing to throw up despite having nothing in my stomach. So I know it might be impossible to answer this question, but is this most likely a reaction to the intensity of the juice (I should think if it was, the vomiting would have ended when the offending substance was expelled)? Or is it possible that I am already experiencing candida die-off? I have no other symptoms besides weakness; no fever or aches or anything. Of course, it could also be just a totally coincidental stomach virus. If anyone with more experience in this could give me an opinion, I’d be grateful. Could this be related to the cleanse, just over 24 hours into it, considering my fast metabolism? My wife, incidentally, isn’t experiencing anything other than hunger-related lethargy. Thanks very much, Brad"
1,Able900,585,"Hello, and welcome to the forum. I’m afraid I have no way of knowing for certain what is causing your sickness since there are so many possibilities considering your explanation in the post. I know that psyllium can cause nausea, vomiting, and/or stomach pain. Both nausea and vomiting “can” be symptoms of die-off although rarely. These as well as other die-off symptoms are your body’s reaction to the toxins/poisons being released by dying Candida. Both you and your wife should be taking Molybdenum for the die-off toxins which are dangerous to your body and especially the liver. If you decide to get these, purchase a pill form instead of liquid, 250 mcg each and take up to three a day for the symptoms and to cleanse the liver. Having a sauna or soaking in a tub of hot water (long enough to produce perspiration) can also help to wash out the toxins. Most importantly, drink LOTS of water which will also wash the toxins from your body. Don’t take the die-off symptoms lightly as they are dangerous to your body’s health just as much as the Candida is. Instead of drinking milk, simply drink the peppermint tea when you feel nauseous since the milk will feed the Candida. Chamomile and ginger teas also contain nausea-fighting, properties. It may help if you add steamed vegetables to your detoxing program because of your metabolism. Steamed fresh vegetables would be acceptable during the detox period. Juicing is a perfect idea; doing this throughout your treatment will be beneficial to the treatment. Quote: Several pints of club soda with lime (hey, you go to a bar to watch football, you have to buy something even if you’re on a cleanse, right?) Reply: Water with lime juice would have been a better choice since club soda is carbonated; carbonated water is just one more toxin for the liver to deal with during the Candida infestation, not to mention that it was counter-active to the detox process. You mentioned salt; what type of salt are you using? Check the ingredients. Let us know if you have other questions, and good luck to both you and your wife. Able"
2,raster,585,"I think the main reason you are vomitting is because you are doing the psyllium husk and clay cleanse, which is not recommended because it can cause internal bleeding. You should consider a different alternative and safer cleanse such as the one mentioned at the following link: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst997_Proper-and-Safe-Cleanse.aspx Also check out the protocol for a general good treatment plan: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx Are you juicing with fruits? Fruits contain sugar and are not allowed on the cleanse or the diet. -Raster"
3,bradleywinkler,585,"Hello Able and Raster, thanks so much to you both for all of the time you spend dispensing advice on this forum. It’s deeply appreciated. I knew when I asked that the question couldn’t be answered for certain since there are too many variables involved. Fortunately, after a good night’s sleep and not putting anything more into my stomach, I woke up yesterday feeling fine. So whatever it was seems to have worked its way out of my system. Perhaps it was the psyllium, Raster, though that was only one teaspoon taken over 24 hours before the vomiting, and I had used the bathroom several times earlier in the day on Sunday. At this point, I tend to think that since I was already feeling weak and my stomach was empty and angry about it, the lime juice detox drink (for which I juiced the whole lime, rind and all) was probably just too much acidity to handle. Also, Raster: Yes, I am following the protocol, but I didn’t find it on Saturday until after we’d already had the detox drink with the psyllium/clay. Able: I got molybdenum and we have been taking it since yesterday. And, the milk was strictly an emergency measure I resorted to with the vomiting — clearly it didn’t help, as it exited my body the way it came in relatively short order! The salt I use is Hain iodized sea salt. It does contain a very small amount of dextrose, but I looked it up and it’s only .04%, which is pretty miniscule. Doubt this would be a problem? We have now taken to eating eggs and raw, steamed, roasted or lightly sauteed (grapeseed oil only, not butter) vegetables, and supplementing it with 1-2 pints of green juice (Raster: no fruits other than lemon/lime). We really wanted to try to do a total juice fast, but I just don’t think my body is cut out for it, and I know to listen to what my body is telling me it needs (except for the beer and bratwurst it really wanted during the game on Sunday…). It’s still not easy, but I know it’s temporary. I have some other food-related questions, but I’ll post them in a separate topic. Thanks again. Brad"
0,JohnnyPonny,586,Hey Im thinking of ordering “Megaflora” from “iherb”. But on the webpage they dont recommend shiping this to countries outside USA. The resone is that they can not send the packeddge “ice insulated. And therfor this will compremise the supplemnt. Im from norway btw. Have looked a littel around to see if I can find a differnt webshop who has a solution. But no luck yet. Any tips on this would be much appricated 😉 The shops that sell “probiotics” in my local shops have probiotics but they dont contain more than 6 billion. And they dont have “Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1”.

2,JohnnyPonny,586,"Nice, thanks 🙂 Y kinda sucks that it cost so much more. But if the shipping destroys the probiotics, whats the point of ordering it. Always nice with a cheaper one 🙂"
3,raster,586,"Check out google shopping for places that sell it and ship it to norway. It costs about $20 extra US to ship the package with refrigeration which will prevent the probiotic from being destroyed by shipping. If you ship it without refrigeration, the probiotic should still be rather intact as long as it is shipped quickly. Probiotics can survive up to a week without refrigeration. If you don’t want to fork up the cash to pay for a good probiotic, you could simply just eat a bunch of (homemade) kefir or greek yogurt. This also contains probiotic. -Raster"
4,JohnnyPonny,586,"Did not know about google shopping, nice tool. Thank you 😉 Gladly to pay the 20 dollars to get a complet supplement. But I think I can get the supplent to me in under 5 days.

Whant to make sure im taking a good probiotic 🙂 Im making my own yougerth and got my kefir grains yesterday. The yougerth tast awsome and with stevia it is superb.

0,candidamente,587,"I have been battling with Candida for a year and a half now. The first time I had I did not know what it was, nor the causes, but as many of you on here, I have studied a lot about this infection and I know more about it. Over time I have neglected the symptoms, thinking it would be something instead of something else, or hoping it will just pass as a cold. But Candida is not a cold and doesn’t just go away if not cured properly. This site is very useful and covers most aspects of Candida, giving great advices. As an Herbalist student, I have tested on myself a mix of herbs that are a combination of anti-fungal, immune system supporter, natural antibiotics herbs, bactericidal, anti-microbial and so on. These herbs (*about 17 all together*) are very easy to find at your herbal shop but it will be more difficult to find a combination of all these herbs together in any shop (plus much more expensive). Anyone interested please do let me know, I can give you the list of herbs or make the capsules for you (3p each 00 veg capsule) Hope it will work for you as it’s working for me."

4,candidamente,587,"Hi Thomas, there are a number of herbs that can work towards the dying-off of Candida, while protecting our immune system and the overall well being. Here I am listening a few that I use in powder form to make the capsules I take, with some of their properties, in particular those that help to heal the Candida, support the immune system and cleanse the toxins out of the body. Garlic: Antibiotic, anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-viral, antispasmodic, antiseptic, fungicide. A natural antibiotic – Bacteria DO NOT become resistant to it. Aloe Vera: bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus viridans and 5 strains of streptococcus mutants – the cause of dental plaque. It is used as an antibiotic, demulcent, coagulant, analgesic for mild degree pain and antiviral. Helps to eliminate toxic minerals from the body and neutralises free radicals created by toxic substances. Has a soothing and protective effect on the digestive system. Cinnamon: It has anti-spasmodic, anti-microbial, carminative, anti-diarrhoea, anti-worm and antiseptic properties. It is also used to counteract flatulence and diarrhea. Used for a weak digestion, vomiting, hyperacidity, to promote secretion of gastric juices, irritable bowel, summer diarrhoea, influenza and colds. Suppress growth of numerous micro-organisms such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Beetroot: High in iron and silicic acids, it assists regeneration of red blood cells. Cellulose fibre helps cleanse the bowel and promotes bowel movement. It is also a good Liver, biliary system and gall bladder clenser.

Rosemary: a member of the mint family which is high in antioxidants and contains carnosic acid, rosmarinic acid & camphor (antimicrobial). Rosmarinic acid has a number of interesting biological activities e.g. antiviral, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. Rosemary extract has been shown to improve the shelf life and heat stability of omega-3 rich oils, which are prone to going rancid. Recent evidence also suggests that it may also help in the body. It also sweetens the breath. Oregano: contains a number of constituents which are responsible for anti-microbial and anti-fungal actions and inhibit the growth of Candida. Orange Peels: In Chinese medicine, used as a diuretic and for digestive properties. Contains plenty of healthy vitamin C and bioflavanoids. Uva Ursi: also known as bearberry. Has an antiseptic effect on the urinary tract provided the urine is alkaline. Traditionally used for cystitis, urinary infections, prostitis, oedema of the legs & face. Avoid in pregnancy.

Also cleanses the liver and gallbladder and can be used to treat problems affecting these organs. Used to reduce period pain and regulate menstrual bleeding. The infusion makes an effective douche for vaginal thrush. Also consider Echinacea angustifolia root, Echinacea purpurea root, Eleuthero root, Usnea lichen, Cat’s Claw bark, Grapefruit Seed, Quercetine, Chapparal Leaf… Tea Tree oil for external use I find it to be quite a relief when the itching is unbearable. —Do you know herbs which help with adrenal fatigue? White American Ginseng root, Astragalus root, Milk Thistle seed, Chinese Ginseng root, Asian Ginseng root, Eleuthero root, Echinacea angustifolia root, Mullein leaf & flower. Used as a tonic these will build, strengthen, tone and increase the ability to handle stress while reducing fatigue."

0,Kots,588,"Hi all, I am new to the site and on day two of cleansing. Here’s my story to sum it up. 3.5 years ago had severe allergic reaction to Cipro and Levaquin; quinolone antibiotics. The reaction to these pills is quite disturbing as the damage gets progressively worse in severe cases for years and years ending in chronic and permanent tendon damage, gastro, neurological, you name it..I’ve been through hell the past 3 years. It would take me all night to go over it but to sum it up, I believe my reaction to these pills not only have led to extreme hypersensitivity to processed foods and meats (a very common issue) but also led to a yeast problem in my body and honestly I’ll do anything to determine if yeast could be causing gastro problems for 3 years now. All the candida symptoms seem to add up to this, especially the fuzzy/white tongue and my constant dry mouth which is leading me to insanity. About a year ago I saw a somewhat nutsie holistic doctor, after running my blood work he mentioned I had tested positive to candida but he did not seem concerned at all and brushed it off like it was normal. After running across this site I truly believe that this diet can really help me. One of my major issues is SEVERE dry mouth, parched all the time. The back of my tongue has gotten extremely milky, creamy, thick coating, I’ve had this for 2 years now. A few years ago I got tested for Trush but it was negative but now I feel that this is getting worse. If its not Candida what the hell could it be? So here I am and I’ve been trying the cleanse option1 for 2 days now but I started this while I was somewhat sick and fighting the flu so here’s are my questions. Have any of you heard of my condition, its also referred to as being “floxed”? And if so, has this diet helped? Is it okay to start this cleansing while somewhat sick? I do not have a fever but Im definitely fighting something And finally, I am scared SHITLESS of what I read about the Die-off, and with my condition I’m really worried that it could be worse for me than normal. When I ran across this site I was ecstatic to learn that I may actually have hope in improving my gastro problems and possibly improve everything else, I feel like I have no choice but to do this. I am just really worried about the die-off. Thank you for reading this and taking the time to help Mike"
1,Jackie2,588,"Mike, I got thrush from doc’s and medicine and can’t seem to shake it but they test me and say I don’t have it…but I too wonder what the heck is my throat sore from, why dose the edges of my tongue burn? My ENT called this group/diet a cult? I’m standing firm with these good folks they know their stuff and their wisdom is worth its weight in gold. Every time I think about eating something or doing something I first do a search here and then always think twice. I did not do the clense so I can’t speak to that. I can tell you the oil pulling they taught me worked wonders for my thrush. I’m still doing it…trying to get in three times a day but that was hard while working. I’m now off and hope to kick this crap out of me just as you hope to. I wish you much luck and pray that the die off is not too bad. I did have bad cramps in my legs…hurt to walk that lasted about a week. I can’t believe how my energy is restored. How much better I feel mentally. I definately had brain fog and I was over weight. Today I have lost 30 lbs and I’m so much better off. Each milestone I pass I feel like I’m going to beat this darn stuff. Focus on your mission and LISTEN to these great folks here. They will give you amazing guidance and peace of mind. WE are so blessed to have them here. Your in my prayers, Jackie"
2,Kots,588,"Jackie, thank you for replying so quickly. At first my dry mouth and being parched started instantly that it forced me to stop drinking anything besides tons of water. I assumed that the coated milky tongue was just another side effect from having dry mouth. I’m still not sure. The aches in your legs, I have that every day from these antibiotics, thats why the die-off scares me. I’m already in pain so I’m scared it will be detrimental to me. When you say you didn’t do the cleanse, I really don’t want to do it either lol, I didnt know if that was an option? I read on the site it really helps with the die-off. I am miserable right now eating only veggies but its a small price to pay if this helps. Thank you again and I will take your advice and listen to everyone. Mike"
3,dvjorge,588,"Mike, My candida infestation was also linked to Levaquin and Cipro. They were the triggers to my severe candidiasis. To tell you something, I took Levaquin for 28 straight days !! So, you can figure out.! I have read many stories from people who have taken quinolones. I have been in every website dedicated to quinolones damage. Anyway, I will tell you that my experience and research have taken me to the conclusion most of the damage people blame to the quinolones is caused by a hidden intestinal fungal overgrowth that MD don’t have any idea. The quinolones trigger the fungal overgrowth and people and MD think the symptoms after the antibiotics are caused by the fact you took them. Sadly, it probably isn’t in this way in spite the antibiotics can cause reaction in some people. A fungal intestinal overgrowth can cause a ton of symptoms around the body that Drs don’t have any idea what is causing it. I believe most people suffering quinolones damage can recover if they knew about this syndrome. In fact, most of the symptoms people report after the quinolones are common during CRC. Unfortunately, most of those people haven’t found the light and have been following their MDs. I hope you have found the way to escape of the ignorance that surround quinolone’s victims.  I was left almost dead after them. Now, I am totally functional and keep a job and a family.  Good Luck, Jorge."
4,sandradavis,588,"Don’t join a diet plan. Eat healthy. Plenty of veggies and lean proteins (fish, chicken, the occasional egg.) No soda, no desserts or syrups. Nothing fried. I would say stick mostly to fruit, yogurt OR hard-boiled egg, and nuts for breakfast, maybe occasionally a healthy, low calorie, low fat cereal with milk. Oatmeal is good as well, just be careful with the honey or sugar. I actually like to eat yogurt with some drained canned peaches and yogurt and maybe some nuts. Lunch should be a salad (maybe w/ chicken for protein) and low cal, low fat dressing (Italian’s a nice tasting somewhat healthy choice) or lunch meat with lettuce, cheese, maybe tomato rolled into it. Dinner should be lean meats with plenty of veggies (a side salad or steamed veggies–asparagus is a great choice) and maybe some plain rice (not cheesy or lots of added flavors.) Beans are a good side as well. Snacks should be veggies and maybe one serving of fruit a day (in addition to your breakfast), cheese, nuts, or my favorite–edamame soy beans. Add a bit of salt and you’ve got a healthy, protein-filled snack that actually has the nutritional value of a vegetable. And drink LOTS of water! This helps your body cleanse itself and often curbs hunger. A lot of times when you think you’re hungry you’re actually thirsty. At least 64 oz a day, I shoot for closer to 100 oz. Hope I helped you!! 🙂"

Hope I helped you!! 🙂 Hi sandradavis! What are you talking about? This is totally nuts. Do you understand what happens if a person with candida infestation is doing what you are suggesting? Before you open your mouth trying to give advice to suffering people study your subject and don’t poison them with your advice. Have you ever had candida infestation??? Fruits will feed the candida! Nuts contain very often mould and should be avoided if one doesnt want his candidiasis to explode. The sugar in milk will feed the candida population. there are tons of totally crazy suggestion in your mail and I would suggest that you hang a while here and learn before you open your mouth again. Cheers  Thomas"
6,Jackie2,588,"Mike, Not sure where Sandra got her information from. I can only suggest you stick to the protocol laid out here by able and raster and only that. If you read any of my post which are always questions to them they read.. I ate a small nut 1cm in size that dropped on the counter while baking and it had sugar on it. My mouth is reacting…UGH. Well, a speck of nut and few grains of sugar set me back. I ate almond slices about a 1/2 of a teaspoon in stage one…set me back. I used a tsp of the wrong kind of vinegar…set me back. I ate sunflower seads on a salad about 1/2 teaspoon…set me back. I ate a few rice crackers ( 4 -5 of them) that had soy in them…set me way back. My little mistakes always set me back. It is shocking because the amounts are so small. When she said to eat fruit…my skin just cringed because that would be inviting something awful into your system. I first foud out I had thrush and I was creaming the inside of my mouth with oatmeal…felt good and soothing for the moment…then a huge burst of pain and more thrush…feeding the thrush. The doctor said it didn’t matter what I ate. This Forum is the truth and the light. Listen to ABLE and RASTER. I would read other’s post but for now they are our two examples of folks that have walked the walk and lived this and have come out victors. Sorry to carry on I was just shocked by the above advice and want to give you warnings before you make the same mistakes that I have made. No matter how small of a mistake you make it feeds this crap and always sets you back. I’m very proud of myself as I have not eaten a drop of sweets or even wanted them since November 15 so I’m making huge progress. Something I thought I could or would never do. Be strong and I truly advise you to read this Forum. Read post by Able and Raster that will guide you and give you support, knowledge and most of all lead you down the path to healing. Best of luck to you. And yes, I started this diet while I was very sick. Had been very sick for 5 weeks. That is what lead me to the doctors…to get those darn antibiotics that triggered this whole nightmare…but to be honest, my life is so much more under control. I’m on a path to health and wellness. Because I was so sick the die off was just piled on…I did have much brain fog…lol but I made it through it 🙂 You will too. Enjoy your new path to good health."
7,Kots,588,"Everyone, THANK YOU! You have no idea how much this has helped me. Jorge, I cannot thank you enough. I almost burst into tears reading your post as it is giving me hope that my reaction to quinolones can be cured or at least help. I am so glad that you have helped yourself and found this. I as well have been on all the quinolone websites, it is absolutely horrifying reading all the nightmare stories. I still have every word of the Flox Report embedded in my brain, it traumatized me so much reading that. You have given me the strength to stick through this no matter what, thank all of you for replying. I’m sure everyone here has their own nightmare stories and struggles but with quinolone victims everything I’ve read said I am doomed for a life of suffering and to know that there could be hope on the horizon is such a blessing. I am sticking to this diet, on day 3 of the cleanse. I am going to do whatever it takes to fight through this and hopefully I will be feeling better soon. My lifestyle and eating habits are absolutely horrible. I work 8-12 hours a day on the computer so I am constantly drinking coffee and bread was the stable of my diet! I know I can do this and I am truly grateful I found this website. I want to do this the best way, is there a big difference with cleansing for 1 or 2 weeks, should I push it out to 2 weeks? I was thinking I’d do 10 days and then start the strict diet. Thank you so much everyone!!! Mike"
8,Kots,588,"I have one more question, when I initially had my reaction to Quinolones 3.5 years ago I had severe aches and pains everywhere in my legs. Since then I haven’t had as much pain at all in fact the pain went away totally for over a year but it seems the last two days since doing this cleansing the pain has come back more than ever. Today it is really bad. My confusion is that I am also sort of sick with flu symptoms and I haven’t been sick at all since taking the antibiotics..SO….I just dont know if my flu is triggering this pain coming back OR can it be that the Garlic Liver cleanse and the quick change in diet is causing some yeast to die already and triggering this pain?? I guess there’s no way to know. Thank you again."
9,kirstyk4,588,"Mike, Are you still taking antibiotics? I was a little unclear whether you have to continue to take them or you took them several years ago (or both). The leg pain you are talking about may likely be due to some die-off reactions you are experiencing due to the cleanse/diet. I know I experienced a lot of knee/joint pain and back pain. One thing that really helped me was Molybdenum. Able suggested it to me and it has really helped with the die-off. Check out this post for some more reading on die-off and ways to make it easier (if you have not already). http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst815_Dieoff-Dangers.aspx The flu like symptoms might also be explained by the die-off. It can make you generally just feel horrible. If these symptoms appeared after starting the diet/cleanse, then it is a good guess that it is due to the die-off. I would suggest the Molybdenum if you can find it. Also drink LOTS of water! You will most likely feel yucky for a few days or weeks, but then you will start to notice a great improvement in how you feel. We just urge you to stick with it! 🙂 If you have anymore questions, we are here to help! Kirsty"
10,Kots,588,"Thank you! No, I’ve been off the antibiotics for 3.5 years. I’m have issues since then almost everything you can think of. The supplement you spoke of, I can take it throughout the cleansing period AND step2? So I can start taking it now and just continue it. I had thought you couldnt take it while cleansing and that I should start taking it when I start the probiotics but thank you if that’s the case I will go get it today. Thx again…what about the Detox Drops they mention here. They didn’t carry them at whole foods, I will search online to order some. Mike"

Mike My understanding is that you can take Molybdenum anytime when you are experiencing die-off. You are going to experience some die-off when you start he diet/cleanse, and when you start the probiotics and antifungals. I was told that you can take up to 3 a day while experiencing the worst die-off. And I believe you can take it for several weeks because it is a mineral the body needs. It takes one of the major toxins that Candida releases and gets it out of the body. Important to always drink lots of water throughout. I am not familiar with the detox drops. Maybe someone else can answer that for you. Kirsty"
12,Kots,588,Thank you Kirsty.
13,Jackie2,588,"You should post a question for Able and Raster to answer…they will help you. Drink tons and tons and tons…can’t say that enough. It took me 3-4 weeks on diet and then I got rid of the dry mouth…but I messed up and ate some rice crackers, a piece of nut, some sunflower seeds (small amount 1/2 tsp) and it set me back. I’m back to dry mouth etc. So once your on the diet. Stick to it. Best of luck and have a shout out to Raster or Able. They are the best"
14,Able900,588,"The dangerous problem with people like Sandra who think they’re helping someone with a Candida infestation is that they make the assumption that everyone reading their post has a very “Very” mild case of Candida (and I’m not even sure there really is such a thing). When you’re explaining how to cure a Candida infestation on a forum such as this one, you have to assume that at least one person who is reading your post has the worst case of Candida albicans anyone can have, because you never know that this isn’t the case. Sandra’s advice can actually turn a very mild case of Candida into a literal nightmare for most people who have an overgrowth of the fungi. Fruit, honey, sugar, cereal, canned peaches, milk, rice, cheese? Did I really read all that? Did you look at the name of the forum, Sandra? Just checking. Able"
0,Jackie2,589,"This weekend I took about a 1/4 tsp of basil spread which had pine nuts, basil, olive oil, and parmasane cheese in it and spread it on my coconut bread. When I ate it my bread tasted a little funky…I have not had taste for a long time so I was wondering if the bread really taste like this and I was getting more taste back. A little later in the day I cut another slice of bread and it just did not tast right I threw it out. Now the back of my throat hurts and I’m worried I contaminated myself with some mold that was on the bread…that was not visable. The bread was about 5 days old. I don’t know how long it last…I’m wondering if I fed myself mold and that is why my throat and tongue are reacting this way…am I getting the oral thrush back? I have been on the diet and sticking to it very seriously. I did pick up a walnut and pop it in my mouth when it fell out of baklava when I was baking that. It did have remenants of sugar on it. I couldn’t believe it when I did it. I was chewing it and enjoying it..and then shock hit me at what I did and I spit it out and washed my mouth out…I just don’t know if those small mistakes could do this. I want to call my doctor but I know he will just call in a perscription of nysatin…please advise. I came home from work and drank a cup of Kefir and ate a cup of greek yogurt. I should have done another oil pulling first. Waiting for a bit and will do that as well…did I screw up with the bread…or that bit of pesto spread??? UGH…I didn’t know it had cheese in it. I thought it was basil, garlic and pine nuts…I took such a small amount."
1,Able900,589,"Hello, Jackie. So sorry to hear that you’re experiencing such a reaction. But as you may have seen with Lucy, it really doesn’t take much of a Candida-friendly food to reactivate the fungus if it’s still in the infestation state. It could very well have been a problem with the bread since it was five days old, do you keep it refrigerated? We keep our refrigerated once it’s cooled the first day we make it.  It’s really difficult to say whether it was the bread, the walnut, sugar, or cheese in the pesto that’s causing the problem, but my guess is it was all of the above. I would do the oil pulling therapy three times a day, perhaps for a week or so and continue with the kefir. Able"
2,raster,589,"Well if there wasn’t mold in the bread, there certainly was mold in the cheese! There also was small amounts of mold in the nuts as well (which should be saved for phase 2). I wouldn’t worry too much because soon you’ll be back on track. This isn’t a huge giant setback; your body will be setback a few hours or days at the most. For the coconut bread, I eat it all week long and it lasts me 6 days usually. It does taste a little stale on the final days or so, but I have never had it get moldy. If you left it unrefigerated, I couldn’t see it lasting more than 3 days or so (as a guess). Also, on a side note…as you get better (months into recovery) your taste buds will transform completely. For me, I used to enjoy the flavor of cigarrettes but now I cannot stand them! I have been a smoker for 12 years, and believe me, this is a big transformation. I have cut down to 5 a day now (from 6-9 a day when I started the diet) so getting closer to my goal of quitting completely! -Raster"
3,Jackie2,589,"Thanks for your advice. I’m just shocked. The nut I ate was about 1cm square or less, the pesto spread I tried…was less than a quarter of a teaspoon, and the sugar that was on the nut…well, I mixed chopped walnuts with 1/2 cup of sugar..I bet it was 5-10 grains at the most. The bread was not refrigerated for the first 3 days then I put it in the fridge…I’m thinking it was the bread. OR maybe all of that darn stuff. I tried the pesto mostly to see if I could taste it. So many things I eat and have NO taste at all. Some things I can taste really well. I’m going to do my oil pulling…and more kefir. Thanks so much for your speedy response. I worry about getting Thrush in my esophogus and since it feels like it is in the back of my throat I’m nervouse. I know my doctor will just give me drugs so I hesitate to go back to him. Again thanks for your advice. I am learning. I know what suffering Lucy is going through and I pray for her and Thomas every day. Well for everyone here. I’m so blessed to have this sight and you wonderful people to guide me."
4,Jackie2,589,"Mouth around gums is stil sore and back of throat…I’m even gargling with kefir. What to do. I really don’t have any appetite.

Sorry to ramble..maybe I need therapy???? Merry Christmas sister! Firstly you have to calm down and watch your thoughts. Not all thoughts tell you the truth. If you get thoughts of will I ever be healed etc or what is happening to me, are only thoughts but not the truth. The truth is that you have candida, that the stuff your doctor gives you doesnt help, you noticed too that eating rubbish will make you sick. BUT you know to that there is a way out. Go that way and you will be healed. I dont know what you do or if you have walked for a while now on the path of healing from the inside out. But one thing I know is that you have come to a good path here Able developed. 1. Make up your mind for healing 2. Read everything here about your enemy 3. Dont feed the enemy. Stick to the diet 100 percent and dont you think that a little cookie here and a little chocolade cant harm you. You feed the enemy and the enemy gives you a life quality you dont want anymore.  4. Get yourself very good probiotics and SF722 and follow the protocol outlined here in the forum.  5. do the oil pulling with coconut oil as Able outlined yours  Thomas"
6,kirstyk4,589,"Sometimes when we take a step backwards and get some of our symptoms back (especially anxiety and depression) we start stressing. I know I start worrying that I will never be better and that it’s a lost cause. Thankfully we have this great group here to talk/vent to. Makes this whole ordeal considerably more manageable!

We’re here for you! 🙂 Kirsty"

0,mstewart,590,"I have just finished the detox part of the cleanse, and am proceeding on to the candida diet. I was doing the diet on the website for a couple of weeks before I found out that there were somethings on there that I shouldn’t be eating. I feel like I’ve hit a wall. I really want to eat meat. The eggs are ok the salmon is functional as meat and I am trying to limit my chicken, but I really want to eat meat. I’m tired of feeling hungry all the time. Tired of fixing separate meals for my family to eat. I just feel tired! Any words to carry me through?"
1,raster,590,Do you mean red meat?
2,mstewart,590,"Mostly I miss eating red meat, but also pork and deer. I read during the diet we are only to try to eat eggs, a few select fish like herring and salmon, and chicken only a few times. I just miss eating all other types of meat. Can I add anything other than the eggs, fish and chicken on the first two weeks of the candida diet? After the fist two weeks can I start trying different types of meat and more often? I know that the red meat causes amonia production, and even the bible says that pork is bad for you, but just in general I never realized how much meat I consumed until I tried not to consume so much."
3,Jackie2,590,"Just stick with it…it will get better. I don’t even think about the food I can’t have because it made me so sick I don’t even want it. Kind of like it is poison. Instead I look forward to what I can make and search for new foods to eat. It is a pain to make two meals one for the family and one for myself…however, it is working out. I’m about at week six. I was making baklava with honey, walnuts, sugar and cinnamon yesterday…ugh that was my first hard moment. All the other Christmas cookies have been ok…but that one was a real jerk on the taste buds. I took deep inhales and thought what damage that would do to my body and moved on. Be strong. Think of the set backs you will have. I’m just to the point where I just started to have greek yogurt and kefir and I’m not wanting meat so much anymore. Quite happy with all my veggies. Didn’t think I would get there…but I am. I just know in the end I will be so much healthier and happier for my family to be around me 🙂 This bad part will pass… Best of luck Jackie"
4,mstewart,590,"Thanks for sharing. It’s nice to have someone that is just a step ahead of you that can talk you through. I will just keep plugging on with God’s help.  Most things don’t bother me like the sweets, just the meat. Oh, and apples, and cheese and really peanut butter."
5,raster,590,"Just look at it this way; the ammonia production is very toxic and it dumps that into your lungs and other organs. This can significantly set back your recovery period if you can give candida a toxic environment to grow in. Think of phase 2 as a great vacation that you are looking to some day, and that eventually you will be able to handle the foods you want and desire (most of them at least). As far as the deer…all wild meat is OK as long as you don’t get too much gas production. The big no no’s are pork and beef, but that doesn’t mean you can’t have lamb, buffalo, or deer! Keep it up because in a month you will feel real good! -Raster"
6,mstewart,590,Thanks for the info. I can look at sweets and know that it is really bad for me. It’s a little harder with the things that seem healthy yet are really bad for candida suffers. I will look forward to phase 2 as that vacation I’ve always wanted to take. Thanks for the suggestion.
7,Javizy,590,"mstewart wrote: I never realized how much meat I consumed until I tried not to consume so much. Isn’t that an important realisation to make? Red meat is terrible for your health whether you suffer from candida or not, and us Westerners consume way too many animal products in general. I used to eat meat as the focus of every meal and frown upon anything labelled vegetarian. The idea seems insane to me now. Learn to appreciate veggies more, and I’m sure your body will thank you. The idea that you need meat is just a thought pattern that can be changed with relatively little effort thanks to the wonder of neuroplasticity. If you continue pining for steak until phase 2, you’re going to have a tough phase 1 and be more likely to gorge or go off the wagon when the ban is lifted. I can sympathise fully with your cravings, but try to see this realisation as an opportunity for change and better health. There’s a lot more to food than meat, and a lot more to life than food. Good luck!"

So when it comes to ammonia, the type of animal doesn’t matter as much as the amount of protein that the meat contains per serving. Deer and beef are both red meat with almost identical amounts of protein per serving, and regardless of which animal we’re speaking of, ammonia is produced when the protein is broken down during digestion. Actually, the protein in chicken is broken down in the same manner, but it doesn’t normally cause quite as strong a reaction as red meat, but the protein is still the reason that I advocate eating chicken only two or three times a week at the most during the worse part of the infestation.

0,JC,591,"Hello, I’m new to this forum so I would firstly like to commend the thoughtful guidance and encouragement by all of you. I would like to especially thank Able and Raster for your intrepid dedication. There are not many forums on the internet these days which exhibit the type of integrity that the Candida Diet forum offers. I would like to ask questions and make a few comments that will not only help me get started but hopefully help others. To do this I will have to give a condensed history. HISTORY I have taken a 9 month and a 2 month course of ABX in the past 3 years. The 9 month course was 400 mg of Doxycycline starting in July 2000 after I collapsed in March of that same year. The 2nd course was 6 months ago. I took Ceftin, Zithro, Plaqueil and Probencid. I also used many herbal protocols in-between such as the Cowden Protocol. As you may recognize… I was using these protocols for a possible Lyme infection, that I may or may not have have. I don’t take anything except supplements now and I feel pretty good (much better than the past 3 years) but there is still something missing. Even though I tested positive for Lyme twice from Igenex in California and have had many of the classic symptoms, I have always remained skeptical. I still have slight ringing in the ear, fatigue, sleep problems (I Use .25 Kolonopin) and neurological symptoms including slight vertigo and anxiety (Also Use .25 Kolonopin). Note: One of my biggest reasons for skepticism is that I never really had a Herxheimer reaction (Healing Crisis) from any protocol. There are others but they aren’t as telling. I have become very conscious of my diet in the last 3 years. Following a Lyme/Blood Type A diet is similar to a Candida diet. But I now understand that if I want to eliminate the possibility of Candida then my diet will have to become even more restrictive. I am excited to begin. Without going into every detail, I want to explain some very important clues as to why I may be suffering from Candida. 4 years ago I started juicing fruits twice a day. Lifting weights and jogging 3 – 4 times a week. Wheat sandwiches, dairy and pizza were being consumed regularly and I ate popcorn every night before I went to bed. Drinking beer 3 to 4 times a week. Lastly, stress from a new business and stress from a bad relationship. I can hear all of you cringing. I know, they were bad habits. Especially when most people wouldn’t consider them to be all that bad. Some have commended me for it. I’m sure your familiar with this type of story. So, I came across this site and have tried to read every word I intend to start after the first of the year with the cleanse. QUESTIONS 1. I have researched a few other websites, specificaly The McCombs Plan and The Dr. Humiston’s Candida Kits. What are your thoughts? I have read on this board to listen to most of what McCombs says but don’t use his products and be aware of fruits. 1A. The one thing I like about The McCombs Plan is the easy to follow script. Is there any weekly charts and scripts for this program? 2. Kefer was recommended on this site a few times. I was wondering if the lactose was a bad idea. 3. What is the best way to determine what probiotocs are correct for you? 4. Do I eat during the “more difficult” cleans portion of the program? ie. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Thank you for allowing me to participate."

You can already answer yourself a lot of question by following Ables and Rasters protocol here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx To your question with the probiotics: Buy the best quality you can afford like that one here: http://www.amazon.com/Megafood-Megaflora-Optimal-Potency-capsules/dp/B001AG4SHE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322102218&sr=8-1 Check that they have 20 Billion active 14 life-enhancing probiotics. Very important is that they contain DDS-1 this was only a quick hello from Thomas. I am sure Able is going to answer you more detailed than I can. yours thomas
2,raster,591,"While I like Dr. Mcoomb and the information he mentions, I am not a big fan of his plan for many reasons. First, he allows fruit which is a big no no as far as the diet is concerned. Fruits contain lots of beneficial vitamins and healing properties, but they all have one thing in common…lots of sugar (typically). While you’d think the body can handle natural sugar, in reality it is feeding the candida prolonging your treatment. Sugar is found in other foods including vegetables such as carrots and tomatoes (technically a fruit tho). I look at sugar as the devil right now and its nothing but trouble. The second reason is he allows foods like rice. I feel rice can be problematic if you are very ill with candida because it contains starch and natural sugars; this can feed the candida. It will only prolong your treatment. If you eat it sparingly then its OK (in my opinion). Also you can become allergic to rice (like me) and this shows that it isn’t beneficial to the diet. The third reason is that he allows beef and pork. These are big no no’s as far as I’m concerned because cause a TON of ammonia production (one of the top things you don’t want). Gas can harm the internal organs, create an environment for candida to grow (low oxygen environment), and is pretty toxic in general. My other reason is because he promotes his products which he makes money off of. While he wants to help and heal people, it won’t be effective for everyone because they would be eating fruits, pork/beef, and starches. It just doesn’t make sense to me. Also his probiotics are weak sauce; something like 5 billion per capsule. His antifungal product also is a joke because you can find things that are way more effective such as SF722 undecenoic acid, oregano oil, etc. If I went on the Mccoomb’s plan; I would be in bad shape because I once had horrible leaky gut. My recovery time would be years instead of months and I would spend twice the amount of money (possibly)… Relating to this, everyone has their own individual candida problem (in my own opinion) and I feel that its caused by different factors in everyone. The mcoomb’s plan may heal like 40% (complete guesstimate) of people out there, but it won’t heal everyone. It certainly wouldn’t heal me as much as I’d like! 2)An alternative to cow derived kefir is to make one from goats milk and you shouldnt be allergic to goats milk. Kefir contains many strains of natural probiotic which is the single most important thing you need for your recovery. The benefits outweigh the consequences because it’ll be introducing new micro flora to your gut. This imbalance (caused by antibiotic use) caused you to be here. 3)High count and high strain probiotics are best. Able recommends one with DDS-1 and I like called HMF neuro; both of these are human derived probiotics that heal better than most other probiotics (in our opinion). 4)I didn’t do the cleanse so don’t know. -Raster"
3,dvjorge,591,"I won’t follow the McCombs plan, and less Dr. Humiston’s protocol. I am familiar with both. McCombs allows fruits because in “in vitro” medical research has demonstrated most candida species and strains don’t use fructose as a growing factor. The medical literature stays clear there are still some strains which can metabolize fructose. Moreover, those studies has been performed “in vitro” offering no real value “in vivo”. Since I have a long journey posting in Curezone where people come complaining about lack of results following the McCombs plan, I consider it a waste of time and money. I have read many stories and keep contact with some people who have followed it even more than 1 time without results. Regarding to Dr. Humiston, it is incredible that a MD advocates such as terrible protocol. First, the diet is worse than what McCombs instructs. He uses Dr. Bruce Semon’s diet that you can find easy if you buy one of his books. I don’t advice you to buy any of them since all are on my shelf and were opened only one time. This diet allowing potatoes, grains, honey, etc, will set you back many steps. Also, Dr.Humiston uses a “secret herbal formula” (he believes it is secret) that comes from the famous german herbalist Anna Kreober. There is nothing really effective to eliminate a fungal infection taking that. I have read ingredient by ingredient. It may explains why Dr. Humiston believes this infection can not be cured ( from his FAQ in his website ) No if you have taken antibiotics or have drank chlorinate water. Now, you can image the results he gets when people follow his treatment. Keep away from that garbage. Good Luck, Jorge. By the way, Mc Combs banned me from his personal forum around 3 years ago because I asked him some questions that he couldn’t respond clearly and compromised his business."
4,Able900,591,"Hello, JC, welcome to the forum. It looks like the gentlemen here have addressed all of your concerns except possibly this one about kefir, “Kefir was recommended on this site a few times. I was wondering if the lactose was a bad idea.” The longer kefir is fermented, the less sugar or lactate will remain in the final product. The fermentation will remove all or at least enough of the sugar to prevent problems. Kefir can be the most beneficial food/supplement/probiotic that you take during your treatment. Able"
0,Jackie2,592,Hubby found these crackers and brought them home for me? Any thoughts? http://sesmark.com/products/savory-rice-thins
1,Able900,592,"Hi, Jackie. The Rice Thins contain rice, soy sauce, and sesame seeds. The Sesame Thins contain wheat flour and whole wheat flour plus soybean oil. The Teriyaki Thins contain rice and soy sauce. The Onion & Garlic Thins contain rice, potato starch, and soybean tocopherols. The Cracked Wheat Thins contain whole wheat flour, rice flour, potato starch, potato flakes, wheat germ, soybean tocopherols, and sugar. The Original contains rice, sesame seeds, and soybeans. None of these ingredients are on the allowed foods list, so if you decide to eat any of them, I would say you’re putting your treatment at risk. When you find a new product you’re unsure about, just read the ingredients on the package, if there are any that are not on the allowed foods list, then we can’t say that it’s an acceptable food.

2,Jackie2,592,I was just the rice ones he brought home they had 0 sugar and no wheat/flour…so I guess I was not looking at the soy and seeds. Ugh..it is a tough row to hoe…thanks so much for your careful insight. The fine print matters 🙂
0,kirstyk4,593,"First off, I would like to say this website has been incredibly helpful through this process. There are so many questions and uncertainties to this diet, and I need all the help I can get. Since starting the diet, I have noticed an improvement. I still have some questions as to things I can do to increase my improvement and get back to feeling better again. Here is a little about what I have experienced in past few years. Since I was about 14, I have taken a variety of antibiotics for persistent acne. I’ve taken 4 or 5 different kinds. About 2.5 months ago, I finally stopped taking antibiotics (when I started to put all the pieces together about my symptoms). About 3 years ago, I was slightly overweight. I had tried exercise and eating healthier, but never could get much weight off. Then in April of 2010, I became a vegetarian. In about a month, I lost 20 pounds. I thought it was because I was eating healthier, but I’m beginning to think it’s a symptom of my Candida. Seemed like no matter how much I ate, I continued to lose weight slowly. I’m now down about 50 pounds from 3 years ago. My weight is down so much, that my husband and family are concerned about how skinny I am. It makes it increasingly hard to explain to others why I am limiting my food choices because all they see are my weight.  I have had a rash on my left ankle for about 3 to 4 years now. Finally realized that it has something to do with my Candida. Asked about 4 different doctors and they couldn’t really give me a satisfactory answer. Most said put steroids on it. Since I have started the diet, the rash has reduced by about 85%. Also have had fungus on my big toenails for about 6 years. I’ve taken 2 courses of antifungals and does not appear to have fixed them. I wish I had understood my condition while I was taking antifungals…I probably wouldn’t be in this mess still if I had. Some other symptoms that have gotten worse in the past year are brain fog (I am in graduate school and working on my thesis…brain fog is very frustrating), chronic fatigue, severe bloating, cold hands and feet, dry skin, constipation, and weird movement in my stomach. The symptoms that have been most upsetting to me and life altering are constipation/bloating and the movement in my stomach. In late February, I started having constipation for the first time my whole life. I was eating vegetarian, high fiber with fruits and vegetables. I exercised 2 to 4 times a week and was at a great weight (15 pounds heavier than I am now). No one could explain my constipation. I did several tests and one doctor actually told me it was either in my head or that I wasn’t eating enough (because she noticed I was losing weight). I am not anorexic…I wish people would get past the weight issues and help me get better…so that I might have a chance of gaining weight again. Everyday is a struggle with the constipation. It is keeping me from living life to my fullest and I feel like my life has begun to revolve around it. On the days when I have trouble going, I am very uncomfortable, tired, bloated, have low energy, and in serious pain by the time I eat dinner. Of all the symptoms I would like to reduce, constipation is at the top of my list! The weird movement in my stomach is very hard to explain. Usually happens after I eat, but I do notice it throughout the day (but strongest after I eat). I know that it got its weakest while I was taking an antifungal a few months back (during that time I was eating gluten free but not the Candida diet. I’ve tried so many different things in the last 9 months it’s a mess…) It’s also weaker when I take a probiotics prior to eating a meal. So now that you have a little of my sad history, this is what I’ve been doing lately. I started the Candidia diet in late September. I’ve made a few mistakes along the way, but since have not made them again. I have never intentionally cheated (like eating sweets or thing I knew I couldn’t have). It has been very hard, but I am determined to feel better someday. This is what my meals usually consist of: Breakfast: quinoa with pecans (I soak them then bake them until crispy again and keep them in the freezer) and greek yogurt. Lunch: LARGE salad with 2 or 3 boiled eggs. Add depending on mood and what I have – broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, cucumbers. Dinner: steam a variety of vegetables such as squash, red peppers, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, asparagus, green onions, and green peppers. Put egg whites in there for more protein and almonds (soaked, baked, and in freezer) for protein and fiber. I don’t eat a lot of variety it seems but I try to eat as many veggies as possible. Some one said that variety is a must in order to keep the Candida for getting used to what you eat. That is my first question, is eating different foods every few days going to help my progress? There are certain things I feel I need to eat everyday (such as eggs and almonds/pecans) in order to keep getting fat and protein. (And in case anyone wants to suggest…I tried eating meat again…but that gave me the WORSE week of constipation. I could be due to eating meat again…or it could be due to so little fiber. I am unsure…but reluctant to feel that bad again.)  Here are the supplements I’ve been using – all are Spring Valley brand: Vit C 1000 mg 1 daily Zinc 50 mg 1 daily Magnesium 400 mg 1 daily L-Glutamine 500 mg 4 to 6 daily Biotin 1000 mcg 2 daily B complex 2 daily Fish oil 1200 mg 4 daily Noticed that some may contain sugar…so I guess need to start looking for replacement options for those. Also saw some say to take calcium. I am holding off on that because of my severe issue of constipation. Saw some say to take vitamin D. Is that suggested as well? Here are the antifungals I’ve been using – I switch between them: Garlic 1000 mg 2-3  Goldenseal Extract 4 to 6 Olive Leaf 150 mg 4 to 6 Grape Seed Complex 4 to 6 Are there different antifungals that are more recommended? Also taking Threelac. Sounds like most don’t care for this product, but noticed a huge improvement in my rash on my ankle when I started taking this. Is it suggested that I take this? Probiotics I am taking: Acti Flora 30 billion 4 strands plus prebiotic, 3 daily Culturelle 10 billion 1 strand, 1 daily Florify 5 billion 2 strands plus prebiotic, 3 daily Also been taking Arthur Andrew Medical – Syntol AMD. It contained digestive enzymes, probiotics and prebiotics. I take it in the middle of the night on an empty somach. I read that it is not recommended because may become dependent on for digestion. Is this still an issue if I always take on an empty stomach? Here are some more questions: Is there anything more I can be doing in improve? I’ve been on the diet for just over 2 months and still fighting the constipation. I am noticing improvement in many of my other symptoms but not with the constipation. Is there a certain number of carbs a day that I should try to stay under? I saw that should be under 25 of sugar a day (which I am). I am currently eating around 68-78 carbs a day. Also along with this, is it okay to eat quinoa and other items (someone suggested buckwheat) daily? Since I have such an issue with constipation, I feel like I should eat some higher fiber foods (like quinoa and almonds) in order to help me go. I’ve tried psyllium powder 3 times and each time it made me VERY constipated. I started out with a very small dose and still miserable. Are there any other higher fiber options that are okay to eat? I am already taking magnesium and Miralax daily to help me go. I would very much like my life not to revolve around this anymore. I’m to the point where I don’t care what I have to do to feel better. Any advice you can give me would be GREATLY appreciated! Thank you for your time and patience! Kirsty"
1,Able900,593,"Hello, Kirsty, Welcome to the forum. Can I ask why you’re taking all four of these, Threelac, Acti Flora, Culturelle, and Florify? Nothing wrong with it, but they’re all basically the same thing. You’re wasting a ton of money when you could just be purchasing one good probiotic for around 45-50 bucks. You really shouldn’t be eating nuts or seeds at all, but if you feel you have to, eat only almonds and soak them in water over night or wash them and then bake them on high for a few minutes in your oven which will remove the mold. And don’t worry about not eating meat, you shouldn’t be eating red meat of pork either one. If you’ll describe the brand, etc. of your B vitamin I’ll check it out. Try cream of buckwheat instead of quinoa. Quinoa is basically a seed from a grain but buckwheat is not, it’s made from a ground seed related to rhubarb and sorrel. For the brain fog you can take a natural essential mineral called molybdenum, this will also protect your liver from the Candida toxins which are continuously released in your body. http://www.amazon.com/Health-Yourself-Molybdenum-250-tablets/dp/B00014D01Q/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1323029441&sr=8-5 For constipation, read this entire post, you’ll find some good ideas. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1098_Constipation-Remedies.aspx Able"
2,raster,593,"I’d get a different probiotic, either the HMF neuro or the megaflora one able suggests. These are human derived probiotics and will help you heal better than most other probiotics. Kefir is also a very effective probiotic if you want to make some at home. If you want a better antifungal, I suggest SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne research. This is a very effective antifungal that candida doesn’t adapt to easily and can be used long term. I would alternate between buckwheat, quinoa, and black/red rice. I would alternate between meats as well such as chicken, seafood, lamb, buffalo, etc. I would stop the pecans and eat coconut bread instead. The goldenseal isn’t effective so I would stop this when bottle is up. -Raster"
3,kirstyk4,593,"Able, Thanks for your advice! I will purchase a better quality/quantity probiotic and use it in place of the several I am using now. I’m sure I won’t be spending anymore money than I was on Threelac! With all the options out there, it is nice to know which ones are most helpful. The brand of vitamin B I am using is Spring Valley (High Potency B-Complex). It has: B1 50mg B2 12.5mg B3 50mg B6 12.5% Folate (folic acid) 50mg B12 12.5mg Biotin 25mcg Pantothenic acid 50mg Calcium 118mg The ingredient dextrose is sugar correct? That’s what I was concerned about. Also decided to purchase molybdenum after reading up on it some. I’m looking forward to some of its benefits, especially brain fog! Raster, Thank you for your advice! Once I run out of some of the antifungals I am currently using, I will give your suggested antifungal a try. Looking forward to trying the coconut bread. That will make it a lot easier to reduce nuts, especially pecans. Also starting to alternate between quinoa, buckwheat (and soon brown/red rice). It is very nice to have some more options again. I felt like I was getting into a rut by eating the same foods everyday. That made it especially frustrating when I felt like I wasn’t making progress anymore but hadn’t changed anything in my diet/supplements. One last question for anyone: Is it more important to keep number of carbs consumed daily to below a certain number… or is it more important the type of carb consumed (such as the quinoa and buckwheat suggested)…or both? Thanks again for your advice. I often felt like I was going in circles trying to figure out what I should do and what I should take. There are so many websites out there…often with contradicting information. This forum is amazing and helpful because getting advice from people who have RECOVERED from Candida but who are not trying to sell their own products. Kirsty"
4,Able900,593,"Kirsty; I can’t find a website which listed the percentage of each of the B vitamins. What you want is 100% of each in the tablet; otherwise you’re likely to create a deficiency of one of the vitamins containing a lower amount than others.

Magnesium is vital for the yeast morphogenesis to fungus, and B complex has been identified as growing media to different fungal species, including candida albicans. Later, if you are lucky re-gaining your immunity and fungus free, you can add magnesium and B complex. I can not tell you when is prudent to add those supplements , but if you still experiment symptoms, they won’t help. Jorge."

Able If you have an active intestinal fungal overgrowth, magnesium isn’t adviced. It is an intelligent decision to avoid it until the infection be under control. Some people have reported slow progress when taking magnesium.. No matter if you take it with calcium or not, yeast use magnesium during its transition to germ tube. This is supported by the medical literature. It is correct candida sufferers are low in magnesium and Vitamin B, but those supplements shouldn’t be taken until the infestation be totally controlled. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6432954 Jorge."

10,kirstyk4,593,"I was not aware of the research about magnesium and candida. I’ve been taking magnesium since March or April… Since I am not taking any calcium…I am seriously considering going without the magnesium for a while. I stopped taking the B complex earlier this week because I found out it had sugar in it. Thank you dvjorge for bringing this to my attention. Since I have been taking magnesium for so long, I would imagine it is safe to say I am not deficient in it. I will at least give it a try. 🙂"
11,dvjorge,593,"I believe you can take it later during your treatment. It is hard to tell when you can re-add it safetely. Even taking calcium that may reverse the mutation to fungus, it is smart to stop magnesium. The experiments have been “in vitro” and quantity dependeble. I can not say for sure if an anticandida protocol will be effective taking magnesium, but I am repeting what I have read from some people. What is true candida uses it to switch to its invasive form. So, to be safe, don’t use it. Jorge."
0,Javizy,594,"I’m getting ready to begin the cleanse on New Year’s Day (maybe sooner). I’ve been reading a lot of posts on the forum, and think I have a good idea, but I thought I’d run it by you guys since I’ve already ordered some rubbish I need to return by being too hasty. All I plan on consuming/putting in my mouth for the first 7-14 days are the following. *- Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil  *- Organic garlic, ginger and allowed green veg *- Lemongrass? *- Nestlé Pure Life Mineral Water *- Lemon juice (hopefully organic) *- Cornish sea salt *- Desert Essence Tea Tree Toothpaste – Fennel I’ll eat as little as I can (maybe just breakfast and lunch), but don’t want to starve. I was thinking of lightly steaming veg and blending it up into soups with garlic and olive oil so it’s easy to digest. My job can be demanding at times, so I’ll buy a pack of organic eggs in case I start to feel too weak, but I’m really hoping to minimise animal products. In terms of supplements, I’m thinking of these. *- Molybdenum [Molybdenum, Cellulose, Stearic acid, Magnesium stearate, Silica] *- Vitamin C [Magnesium ascorbate powder] *- Milk thistle [Milk Thistle Seed Extract, Milk Thistle Seed, Gelatin] I’m assuming if I remove the capsule and dissolve in water the gelatin/cellulose won’t be a problem, right? I want to get some D-Alpha-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), but I can’t seem to find an affordable one. Are other forms of the vitamin worth taking? Anything else I should buy? Supplements are so expensive in the UK, even poor quality ones. Would organic herbal teas like milk thistle, dandelion, nettle etc be of benefit? I’ll also try to take a daily bath, although I worry about the water fluoridation. Is there anything like any bath salts that could help neutralise this, since it’s one of the most reactive substances known to man that the government wants us to consume against our will? I think that’s everything for the cleanse. Any advice or tips would be appreciated. Thanks in advance to anyone who read this. Edit: I just found Granary Herbs Swedish Bitters [Water, Vegetable Glycerine (EP, BP) 50% Vol., Aloe, Wormwood, Angelica, Manna, Rhubarb root, Senna leaves, Theriac Venezian (Blacksnake root, Cinnamon bark, Malabar Cardomom, Valerian root) Zedvoary root, Ginger root, Carline Thistle root, Myrrh, Camphor, Saffron]. Are they okay?"

Quote: I want to get some D-Alpha-Tocopherol (Vitamin E), but I can’t seem to find an affordable one. Are other forms of the vitamin worth taking? Reply: Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant as well as a good immune booster among other advantages to the treatment. Alpha-tocotrienol (note difference in spelling) is also a natural form, but whether or it would be available to you is another question. I suppose that if you can’t find a natural source, the synthetic form is better than nothing. Keep in mind that natural forms of vitamin E are found in plentiful amounts in several herbs which are on the ‘allowed’ list. Cloves, curry powder, oregano, ginger and sage, thyme, parsley, cumin, marjoram and ground cinnamon contain vitamin E. Both the ground and leaf versions are fine. Oddly enough the herb or spice that contains the largest quantity of Vitamin E is paprika; in fact, 1 oz. of paprika contains 42% of your daily recommended requirement of vitamin E. Vitamin E is also found in vegetables, such as bell peppers, dark leafy greens (chard, bok choy, spinach, collards, etc.), asparagus, tomatoes, and broccoli. If you do as you say, you’re bound to experience some die-off symptoms after several days at the most. For this you should start your molybdenum at least a day before starting the detox. What is the exactly name (not brand) of the form of molybdenum? Quote: I just found Granary Herbs Swedish Bitters Reply: These should work fine. Able"

0,Thomas,595,"Hi Able, I am confused about a new symptom. All in all I have the feeling I am improving but I have noticed now that I have developed a white cover over my tongue. What confuses me is that I am very strict about my diet and never cheat on it. How is it possible to develop candida on the tongue while being so strict on the diet? As long as I can remember I had a little white coating over the skin of my tongue but not so much as I have now. How is that possible that the candida is growing while I am so strictly fighting it? Or that the enemy shifts position from the guts now out to the tongue? I am doing now what you where writing to the others here on the forum who had candida problems in the mouth and do the business with the oil mouth washing. I only like to understand the workings of candida. I have a question too about the good and friendly bacteria culture in us. From what do they live? We learned that candida needs sugar to grow. But what do the good guys eat so I can help them become strong? cheers Thomas"
1,Lucylu,595,I love the way you word things Thomas! But I’d also like to know what the “god guys eat” so look forward to seeing Ables response. I developed the white coating when I started the oil pulling too. At the same time I increased antifungals so got a little burst of my old symptoms back which I presume was the Candida complaining! I’m awaiting delivery of a very strong probiotic too so presume I’ll get some reaction to that once I start it.

Please tell me how you are doing after you got the strong probiotics. I am still saving up to by some for myself. They are so damn expensive here and even all the other organic stuff is unbelievable expensive. I am not able to push it all in one go. I have to step by step getting the stuff I need together. But it would be cool to no if you feel a big difference. Raster swears on it that the big change came for him after he found the right probiotics. all the best to you and heal quickly my friend!!! cheers Thomas"
3,Lucylu,595,I’ll certainly let you know how they affect me and how they work. I know what you mean about the expense… all the bits & pieces have cost me a fortune so that’s why I was extra delighted to see such great results at my appointment this week. It was worth it but I certainly can’t sustain all of them for the long term so will have to pick & chose soon. I’ll start the Probiotic first and then ask Ables advice on which of the supplements/ anti fungals I can drop. I sincerely hope you see some dramatic improvements soon… I know your case was far worse than mine to begin but hopefully by christmas you’ll be a new man!!
4,Able900,595,"Hello, Thomas. Since it’s you that I’m writing to, I don’t need to ask the apparent question: “Have you eaten anything that isn’t on the diet?” Because I know you have not. So my natural assumption is that what is happening with the thrush is a normal way of acting for the Candida albicans as your body is detoxing via the diet, antifungals, and probiotics. Sometimes old or new symptoms of a Candida infestation with show up during this time, especially if the infestation was an especially strong one. The Candida show up in different ways as they are literally fighting to keep a stronghold on your body. You’re simply experiencing symptoms of your body cleansing itself of the toxins and Candida. Continue to use the oil-pulling therapy several times a day, with coconut oil if possible; this should take care of the problem eventually. As far as the concern that you and Lucy have about food for the beneficial bacteria; of course to prevent the good bacteria from dying off because of the infestation, you will need to feed them as you’re adding probiotics. “Prebiotics” as they’re called, are foods and herbs which feed the good bacteria in our system (because they contain inulin). Some of the major foods which act as prebiotics are oat bran, rice bran, broccoli, asparagus, fresh garlic, greens, onions, avocados, rutabagas, turnips, and cabbage (especially as sauerkraut). Also, inulin is major constituent of the following herbs: chicory root (this also contains other nutritional factors) burdock root dandelion root  elecampane root  yucca root – Yucca root will also reduce inflammation of the intestines which treats leaky gut syndrome as well as support the adrenals. codonopsis (a Chinese herb) chickweed – also helps heal the intestines (LGS) Let me know if you have other questions, Thomas. Able"
5,Lucylu,595,"Thanks Able, a very useful list and thankfully I’m eating nearly all of those things regularly. Alfalfa – was I dreaming or did I see this recommnded for leaky gut, a bit like yucca? And would it be as a supplement or real food?"
6,raster,595,"Thomas, I also had the white tongue after not having it earlier when I was more sick. I feel that this is one of the strongest indicators of candida overgrowth. What it is called is oral thrush. The oil pulling can be used to remove it from the body. One of the strangest things about fighting candida is how the symptoms completely change week to week, month to month. I look at it as peeling a moldy onion, layer by layer…where each layer has something different going on as far as infestation. In a week/month or two, this symptom may go away completely but then you might get a new symptom such as a skin rash or headaches. Then a few weeks later that might go away and then you have red/bloodshot eyes. It really changes up, but I do think you hit it on the head, and that the candida is overgrowing in other parts of the body. -Raster"

Alfalfa – was I dreaming or did I see this recommnded for leaky gut, a bit like yucca? And would it be as a supplement or real food? Hi, Lucy. Alfalfa is actually member of the pea family. It contains protein and lots of different vitamins as well as various minerals including a rich source of calcium; all of this makes it a great whole food as well as a useful supplement when taken in powder form. And you’re right, alfalfa sprouts are one of the many, many starch-free vegetables and fruits that can help to heal leaky gut. Able"
8,Thomas,595,"Thank you guys for the info! Its very interesting to learn from you how the candida behaves in the battle. Its strange these shiftings of symptoms, then a pause in the battle as if the enemy has to collect its strength and then comes a surprise attack in another area of the body. I feel more and more sure about the entire battle and move forward. It feels that even I have still some symptoms here and there deep down within I am feeling that there has come a new strength and life energy into my body. all the best to you all  yours thomas"
0,Sherie,596,"Hi all, Firstly I would like to say thank you to what seems like a very helpful community. I have a query if anyone out there can help me with, being a newbie I am very concerned about the detox followed by the cleanse to be rid of candida. My worry is I am very thin naturally, 5ft 8 and weigh 48 kilos (around 107 pounds) at 28 years of age and have a lot of trouble maintaining weight, being allergic to cow casein, wheat, eggs and gluten does not help. So in other words I don’t want to look like a skeleton though I am really keen to do the detox as I feel that the candida is possibly contributing to me being malnourished. From what I understand a detox like this will really strip off the weight, which is the last thing I want or need to do. I also play a competitve sport as well as work full time so I really need to keep my energy and calories up the best I can. Are there any alternatives or perhaps another path I can venture down to substitute the detox with? Many thanks!"
1,Tuula,596,"Hi Sherie, I know exactly what your are talking about! I lost 8 kg’s even though I was not overweight to start with. But I think it really wasn’t the detox that shed my kilos but more the candida diet, very strict, after detox. And I did not take digestive enzymes that would have been helpful for me, since I have just found out that I have Leaky Gut as well. So I did not really digest the foods I was eating and lost many nutrients because of that. I’d suggest using digestive enzymes and eating a lot of protein with this diet. And I do feel so much better without the constant bloating, etc! I don’t really think it is an option if you have candida. It is something that needs to be taken care of and you’ll be so much healthier. Just keep track of your weight and maybe use some protein shakes to help – but keep clear of the ones with sweeteners! Good luck and take care. Tuula"
2,Sherie,596,"Thank you so much Tuula, In regards to protein powders I have found this one that looks relativly safe: http://www.sunwarrior.com.au/ If you know if this is ok, or beneficial I would love to hear about it. As for digestive enzymes is there any specific brand or strain of enzymes that I should be looking at? 🙂"
3,Tuula,596,"Sherie, I also got some samples from Sunwarrior and they were ok. I would think their product is ok to use. I haven’t used it more than the samples. I’m curing the leaky gut first. My naturopath gave me Orthoplex dig. enzymes called: D.E.F Digestive Enzyme Formula. It contains  Pancreatin 200 mg equivalent to  protease NLT 280 BP units lipase NLT 4000 BP units and amylase NLT 4800 BP units  and Bromelains 100 mg and Trypsin 30 mg. I don’t know if this product can be obtained from shops or only practitioners. I’ve just started on it so I don’t know how well it works, but I am feeling good at the moment:) Hope this helps!"
4,Sherie,596,Any bit of advice is helpfull. Thank you so much for writting that information. Im planning a trip to my nutritionist next week so I will be sure to mention that product. Thanks again. Sherie
5,raster,596,I take pro-gest digestive enzymes. I would not touch that protein powder…it contains rice and cocoa. Rice contains starch and small amounts of sugar. This can feed the candida. It might be safe for phase 2 though. -Raster
6,Sherie,596,Thank you Raster. I will look into those enzymes as well. Mnay thanks
7,raster,596,"To reduce the weight loss, try your best to have 3-4 course meals. Eat things like Kefir, eggs, coconut bread, pumpkin muffin bread, greek yogurt, buckwheat, black/red rice more regularly. The candida diet will often get people down to their normal/healthy body weight for their age, height, sex, etc. I lost close to 20 pounds myself and am very skinny. However I have a feeling the weight loss has slowed dramatically for myself at this point. If you look at ancient egyptian art, there isn’t one “fat” egyptian depicted…its because obesity has only been around for a few thousand years. -Raster"
0,xxsidkidxx,597,"Hi! I am a 25 year old guy who has dealt with Candida overgrowth for YEARS…just recently realized what all my problems were when randomly coming across a website about probiotics. I think you would say I have a severe case…Here were just some of my symptoms: Severe Allergies (to everything), Stomach troubles (extreme bloating, acid reflux, etc), Fatigue, Depression, Anxiety, Brain fog, extremely dry skin (Dermatitis; itchy flakey scalp, ears crack and bleed), and I have tinea versicolor which is a non-contagious fungal infection of the skin. After reading this website and really researching this candida thing, I read so many testimonials where people said after this diet their entire lives changed. I was very hopeful because I am tired of living in misery for all these years. I was hoping for a real change so I started my candida diet on OCT 3. I tried to follow this regimen as close as possible.  The first few days of the fasting I was extremely weak, dizzy and light-headed to the point that I could not drive a car SO I started to add steamed vegetables and felt a little better. Once that week was over, I was relieved but then came the hard part, finding foods that were organic and on the FOODS YOU CAN EAT list. I was pretty successful at sticking to it though with maybe a few mess ups not knowing what was in the ingredients of food I had to eat a friends house, or when I was away from my fridge. As far as the anti-fungals go, my doctor would not prescribe me any strong anti-fungal so I took matters into my own hands and found that Grapefruit extract, oil of oregano and olive leaf were great as natural anti-fungals. I took them all together. NOW to my point of this post….Through this whole diet I suffered extreme Candida die-off, or so I imagine that is what it was; Mainly severe Fatigue and sudden bursts of hives would cover certain parts of my body. The die-off was the worst towards the beginning and then when I introduced the anti-fungals.  BUT it seems it is still happening……  I am still taking the anti-fungals and I am going on my second box of FIVELAC (I assumed it would be better than threelac). Here is the good news…The change in my diet (taking out sugar and yeast and perhaps the help of natural anti-fungals) seems to have gotten the tinea versicolor on my back and chest to be smoothed out and not patchy and dry like it has been for YEARS. The skin coloring seems to also be returning to normal.  Also I am glad I did this diet to learn what are healthy things to put into your body and what is not. Here is the bad news… I have been on this diet since OCT 3 and my dermatitis is still as bad as ever with Dry cracked skin on my face and ears, I seem to still be extremely fatigued with brain fog and now to the point where I can’t even get motivated enough to clean my apartment. I am still feeling itchy-ness and break out in hives all over my body at random times.  Also, maybe unrelated but, I have not been able to get a good nights sleep…even more anxiety than I have normally. SO…any advice? Am I doing something wrong here? Have read so many success stories, when is mine coming? Has anyone else experienced what I have been going through? Hundreds of dollars already spent and still havent reached where I can say I am satisfied…maybe the fivelac takes longer and I am just impatient. P.S. Sorry for the long post."
1,Thomas,597,"Hi xxidkidxx, hi mate, I hear you and I want to tell you that you are not alone. One year ago I started the battle, I cut out all grains, all milk products. That was my first steps.  Did it help. No. I then looked around for a candida special diet and found one where the focus was to eat fat and meat. Did it help no. The strange thing was that I felt in the beginning good. I dont know why but then suddenly everything turned around and even with the candida meat and fat diet I started to feel worse. One night I woke up with a body totally freaking out and I noticed I had a panic attack for the first time in my life. It was terrible. In desperation I searched and found this group here. Learnt a lot what went wrong with my fat and meat diet and thought that I would have the key. I re-booted my battle against candida in two ways. Going to the normal doctor and checking me through if there is something with the heart, cancer or whatever. I decided if they don’t find anything I will go on with the diet because of my history and the symptoms it looks very strong that I have candida. First I thought I had low sugar or low blood pressure or a higher heart rate. No nothing. But still I was feeling terrible. I started with the forums/ables and rasters diet on the 30.10. I had all the time my symptoms and problems but it looked like that they where much softer and everything turned to the better. Then I experienced even a day or two of nearly total symptom free times. I was all up in hope and happiness. But then it fell down mightily. I started to feel terrible again and didn’t understand the ups and downs. I thought that I would feel bad for a week or two and then that I slowly get out of the hole. But for me its ups and downs all the time within a time frame of hours or even minutes. Its like sitting in a boat in storm. Then I really needed a break of the battle and stopped the anti fungals. I felt better again for a day or two only to plump down into the war of symptoms again. Its a strange battle and I would wish that we share more of the symptoms of the die-off and gain more knowledge about it. I am quite confused about it myself. Is it die-off or not. Is it something else like a food allergy. We know that there is die-off coming but I noticed that we are all quite confused what it means and how to read the signs. I know that I would feel much better if I would know where I am in this battle. For me its like this: Most of the time I have brain fog. Sometimes very bad and then very light. There are moments when I noticed oh boy there is no brain fog and no dizziness but its more like I noticed when its not there than I would be shocked to feel dizzy or brain fog. My symptoms turn around and around. Yesterday I had all day this brainfog, heart heart palpitations and strange tingling under my skin. ( I guess adrenalin or histamin or whatever). Then in the evening suddenly they disappeared and I thought oh great so nice can life be. That lasted for 10 minutes when my stomach filled up with air and I had stomach pains. And the skin around my anus started itching. I really wondered why its going around and around. It feels like being in a battle where the enemy has surrounded me. Attacking from here or there.  Right now I have dizziness and little hear palpitations. A tip for you: You might consider not taking so much anti fungals together. For you the diet might be enough as a start, then you take the grapefruit-seed extract for 2 weeks. Starting with one glass and few drops a day building it up to 3 glass of water with 25 drops a day. After 2 weeks you change to oil of oregano but don’t take them all together. you are not alone mate, all the best to you Thomas"
2,xxsidkidxx,597,"Hey Thomas! Good to know I am not alone but then again not good…I wouldn’t wish this upon even my worst enemy. It sounds like you have had your share of the battle too. It’s unfortunate how expensive trying to cure this thing can be. And here in the states, it seems every doctor I have been to about this seems to brush it off. They just want to prescribe more medicines…which I believe is what got me in this mess in the first place. You see, When I was a newborn my mother said that the hospital they took me to didn’t recognize my asthma for what it was (asthma) and instead mis-diagnosed me with bronchitis and even at one point said they thought they saw a tumor in my lungs on an xray..which come to find out was phlegm…Luckily doctors know a little more about asthma now. I was lucky I didn’t die. Anyway, a majority of my childhood was spent on prednisones and antibiotics. Even in my highschool days I was prone to getting horrible sinus infections and the doctor I had, prescribed me antibiotics like they were candy.  It wasn’t til recently that my mom asked me to research taking Garlic on a daily basis…I thought that was weird but researched it and it ended up bringing me to a disorder called Candida overgrowth.  So here I am… So my question is, you said you have been fighting this for a year. Have you followed this particular regimen for a whole year? I am really curious about the itchy-ness and peeling dry skin. I keep thinking it is candida die-off but at the same time (like you said) I am wondering if it is my body telling me not to eat certain things since I am in the phase of reintroducing foods. Thanks for your story and letting me know I am not alone in this…kind of a scary feeling, huh? You said your stomach starts hurting occasionally….Are you taking threelac/fivelac probiotics?

How would you say the MegaFlora probiotics compare with FiveLac? Raster, I first started following the diet that was listed on this website starting from stage 1 and am now in stage 3 (hoping for a good change now). I wish I would have seen this forum first and your protocol, otherwise I would have followed it to a T.  Right now my diet consist of all the foods on the “allowed foods list” and slowly have introduced other things back into my diet. I can say that almost every morning I eat a vegetable omelette and almost every night I have a bowl of guacamole from the recipe section on this website. I try my best to not eat dairy, sugar, or things that contain yeast…which is hard but has been doable.  As far as supplements go, The only thing I am taking right now besides FiveLac probiotic are Grapefruit seed extract and biotin. I WAS taking Grapefruit seed extract, Oil of Oregano and coconut oil all together but the die-off got to be too much.  It is still strong though and I don’t know how long it normally takes to get rid of it completely where I don’t experience the die-off.  Should I have been waiting til the die-off goes away to proceed with taking the probiotics or is it okay that I am taking Fivelac with my herbal anti-fungals?"

Fivelac contains 5 strains and a 2 billion count. That’s a pretty big comparison I think. Molybdenum, a natural essential mineral (in pill form), will lessen the die-off symptoms and protect your liver from the toxins. Able"
0,alexquinn,598,"Hi, so I’m 18, in my last year of highschool, and I’ve been feeling sick for months now. I really think it’s Candida overgrowth, and I’m starting this diet to get rid of it, but I really need some advice on how to start the diet, and I just want to voice some general concerns and worries that I have with it. Ok, so my issue is this, I’m starting this “cleanse”/diet and I’m finding it darn near impossible to do. I’m a runner, weighing about 150 pounds of lean muscle, and I’m not trying to toot horns hear but I literally have no fat to spare/burn while starving myself for two weeks. Not to mention, that my super fast metabolism and lifestyle has always demanded eating huge amounts of food (I’ve stopped running for the time being until I get better, though I’m still super hungry). The cleanse calls for no carbs, that seems ludicrous! I will die on no carbs. I already feel ravished after doing it for 2 days. Have you all done the cleanse or do most people skip it? Then, when I move into “Step 1,” that calls for little to no carbs. Do you manage to do that or do you just pig out on whole-grain rice? I’m sure this is just a noob rant/complaint but man, help me out please."
1,Able900,598,"Unfortunately, Candida lives on sugar and carbohydrates which includes all whole grains such as rice and even brown rice. If you have to have a certain amount of carbs in your diet, all you can do is perhaps take loads of antifungals and powerful probiotics plus kefir in the hope of stopping the growth. Able"
2,raster,598,"We don’t eat rice on the diet…it isn’t allowed. If you alternate between red/black rice and buckwheat, you might be OK, but you cant eat it every day or the candida will adapt to your diet. -Raster"

0,Thomas,599,"Here is a pm I wrote to Able a couple of days ago and Able wrote to me that I should post it here for all to benefit his answer. I was first unsure if I want to do this because the post was several days ago. Meanwhile I felt quite good again for 1 and half day. Then today the battle with the body or lets say sickness turned again to the same stuff I wrote about. Unfortunately the post became again fresh and new. What confuses me in the battle of sympthoms is the strong up and down with me. Not that I have a 5 weeks die-off and then it gradually gets better and better. Just when I believe that I am on the edge of being sympthom free, it hits me back with full strengh only some hours or a day later. What is that? Is that normal in the war against Candida? Are you experience the die-off like me. Anyhow, here comes my older post I posted to Able: Hi Able, today I started the day again with this bubbling sensation in my body, dizziness, cold hands, a feeling of being shaky in my fine move-moments. Heart palpations. After my breakdown I have been 24 days now following the forum diet very strictly and wonder what to do next. I am still not symptom free, its a continually up a down of symptoms every day changing by the hour. I cant see that it got better even in the long run. Shall I anyhow go and add some kidney beans to the diet. I am still loosing weight. I am 185 cm tall, male, 49 and my weight is today 77 kg which is if I translate it right 12 stones and 1.78 pounds. I am not lost in my determination but I am attacked by the confusion if I have really candida or if its a cross allergy. I got a shock yesterday when I felt so bad after simply eating the cauliflower soup a simple avocado with some lime and very good salt. It should not have made me feel so bad if I would not have some other stuff floating around. I wonder about menopause as I am turning 50, a hormonal unbalance of a kind. Or some cross food allergies. There are tons of symptoms fitting very well for the candida but this heart palpations and the crawling, prickling and bubbling sensation under my skin or in my blood drives me nuts. Do you have any suggestion what you would do in my place, I am lost where to go and what to do. thank you Thomas"
1,raster,599,"Thomas, if you can go to the sauna more often, this could greatly help your body detox from the candida. If possible, go up to 6x per week. This can help eliminate any die-off symptoms. -Raster"
2,Able900,599,"Quote: “There are tons of symptoms fitting very well for the candida but this heart palpations and the crawling, prickling and bubbling sensation under my skin or in my blood drives me nuts.” Hello, Thomas. I know how much all of these things have been bothering you, so what I want to do is to show you how all of these are connected with an advanced infestation of Candida albicans. Anxiety, stress, nerves, and panic attacks are all very common symptoms of a Candida infestation. Anxiety attacks goes along with the heart palpitations; they can take place at intervals of hours or days. All of this is because of a literal invasion of your body by billions of live pathogen-type organisms. We can’t imagine what this can do to a human body, but we can definitely feel it every hour of every day. This is a direct quote from an official explanation of one of the hundreds of possible symptoms of a Candida albicans infestation gone septic. “Typical Complaints: Pins and needles in the legs, hands feet or arms. Numbness in the fingers, toes, hands, feet , arms or legs, or a tingling or pricking sensation, a creeping feeling under the skin of the body.” Doesn’t that sound like what you’ve experienced? If so, then it’s another symptom of the Candida infestation. The “explanation” of how all of these can be symptoms of a Candida albicans infestation is, once Candida becomes systemic, meaning it has buried into the intestinal wall and entered the blood stream; it then punctures tiny holes in the wall which allow products from the bowel to enter the blood stream. This is called gut dysbiosis, and it sets the body’s alarm bells ringing as the bowel products enter the sterile environment of your blood stream. In addition to this, the holes in the wall allow tiny food particles from the intestines to pass into the blood which we know can produce food allergies, which in turn provoke an inflammatory response in the body. It is the combination of these responses which can result in the numbness, crawling, prickling or tingling sensations associated with Candida. But there is a cure for these symptoms; once the intestinal problem has been taken care of, all of these sensations will subside and cease to be a problem. The first step of course is to eradicate the Candida albicans from the intestines and colon as well as the blood stream. Once this is accomplished through the Candida protocol, you will then begin to heal the intestinal wall which will cease the continual leaking of products and fungus from the bowel into the blood stream. Without these antigens the body will no longer experience inflammatory responses and the crawling, tingling and numbness feelings will subside.  How we heal the intestinal wall: This is done in several ways once the Candida itself is under control. Rebuilding the flora will be the major role in repairing the intestines (leaky guy syndrome). Of course a good probiotic and kefir will rebuild the flora better than anything else we can use. And the foods that are prebiotics such as green vegetables and avocados, oat bran, onions and garlic are feeding the new flora all the time keeping them healthy and multiplying.  Chickweed herbs will help to promote healing of the intestines, and yucca root will reduce intestinal inflammation and support the adrenal glands. Bitters will also heal the intestinal walls. I hope this helps you to understand better what you’re going through, Thomas, let me know if you have other questions. Able"
3,Thomas,599,"Hi guys,  Raster: I go once a week to the sauna. Its very good. After that I swim for exercise.  Its only for an hour as I wait for my daughter training to finish. She is a competitive swimmer. Should it be longer to work better? Hi Able, thank you for your patience with me. The confusion is somehow the worst part for me. Its kind of a battle of believes. I have no problem with the food, diet, needs, hunger etc. If I would know that its good I can stay forever in stage 1 of the diet. What is so demanding for the mind is the confusion. You help me greatly to calm my mind and to move on and on every day. What confuses me is the leaky gut mixed with the candida. How do I know when the candida is in controll? I might still have the same problems as the leaky gut still is doing what the candida was doing before. Then I am confused about healing the leaky gut. I experience and read that having a leaky gut one can react in a negative way to everything. It looks like that I react to things which are good like Kefir, garlic and onions. I read too have people with leaky gut can be allergic to acidophilus. It says for the intestines to heal one should avoid the food on is allergic too. Then one should rotate them on a 3 days schedule. For about 5 month I started with a food journal to figure out what is working and what is not. I have no clue. Some great days are with food like kefir and even a garlic. When I am happy that this food was ok. I get a smashing reaction 2 days later which really messes me up. Off and on it goes. The result is utter confusion about the steps to be taken. What I do now I follow the diet of phase 1 to the point but dont know if the reaction are from the candida or if the candida is under control as I still have the symptoms with the same strength but…..then again… I sometimes experience hours of nearly 100 percent freedom from symptoms. What do you think about my plan of action? I stick in phase 1 of our diet and give a dam about symptoms. I dont eat garlic and onions because my reactions are too strong. I take again Grapefruitseedextract to kill off candida  I order Oil of oregano extract when i have money and rotate it with the GFSE. I save more money and order a very powerfull probiotica I play around with the Kefir to figure out how much I can take. Maybe its the amount and if it looks hopeless I will see if I can stand the probiotica. Any other ideas what to do better? thank you for all your help guys!!!!!!! Thomas PS Am I allowed to eat yucca root in stage 1 of the diet. Is it called too cassava root? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava Can I eat the Jerusalem artichoke? Its high on inulin but I don’t know if its feeding the candida? Can I eat the chicory root too? I don’t know if I can get them but I will see if they can order it for me."

I would appreciate some advise from others persons that have done then colon cleanse with out the colon flush. (before the detox stage) I am currently on day six of the colon cleanse and have been following the diet, timetable quiet accurately, drinking allot of water and going for a daily walk. I have been feeling all the symptoms this web site has highlight, but as I’m at home for the week I can just chill out and relax when I’m feeling fatigued. The question I have is: (sorry for the detail.) I am at day six and have not passed any solids for 4 days, when I passed solids on the first 2 days they would be classified as small. So in a nut shell, not allot has happened in that department. Note, I am following the diet, and 2 days ago I have even taken an additional natural laxative to move things along with no avail.  Also, it was my birthday weekend before I started the cleanse and believe me I ate and drank if it was my last supper. So I would be expecting some type of movement in the bowels. Is this normal?  Should I do anything about it as I am about onto the detox stage? Should I muster up the courage for a colon flush? I am urinating excessively, is this normal? Also, could someone explain to why I am not feeling hungry. It’s a bizarre feeling to have only broth for 6 days straight and not feel hungry. Keeping that in mind, I have also drop 5kg (10 lb) in weight in this 6 days. Yes I’m a wee bit over weight but this was not my intention. Basically, I was sick and tired of the excessive bloating and unable to move weight when I exercised. Though I had always known there was an in balance in my gut, I took action when my osteopath suggested that I may have Candida. I would really appreciate anyone input who has experience or known the answers to the above question. Cheers All Thank You Col"

I believe that you are not hungry is quite normal, when I was on a fast I was not hungry after one to two days. The body switch systems and is using up the fat which was stored up in your body. This could explain too why there is no bowel movement.  I believe that your body is switched to another system, not hungry but not needing either a bowel movement. Its the same with me, I drink a lot and dont eat. Bowl movement stops, I am not hungry and have to pee a lot because of me drinking a lot. The pee is then after a while like water, there is no yellow colour any more. I believe everything is in order and if you dont feel sick with headaches or other die-off symptoms I would not worry too much about the situation. cheers Thomas"

2,anniroC:,607,Thanks for responding Raster. I appreciate your insight. Sometimes it helps to know you are not the only one going through these crazy side effects. C:
3,Pina,607,"anniroC, I am a rather sensitive person but lately I feel teary over the silliest things! I’m hoping this will improve by the end of the diet."
4,Toosweet,607,"Hello, I feel very depressed and emotional too. Especially after finding out that I have reintroduced some stage 2 foods too quickly. The thought of starting over again is sending me in a dark spiral. Today, I have given up my beloved coffee but this may just add to my blues. I have mild candida ( my score on the mini score test is 4) but have had success with chronic sinus issues so I’d like to stick with it."
5,BenjiRixon,607,"I think it’s quiet normal for everyone doing the diet to become emotional in the first month or 2. For me being a chef, and I expect most people feel the same, having the basic enjoyments taken out of your lifestyle is a very depressing issue. The first few weeks were awful and got to a point where I hardly ate anything for a week or 2, just enough to survive and really did hit rock bottom. I was very depressed and moody and had a general feeling of emptiness all over. I think at that point I sorta give up on thinking about ever eating normal food or going for a few beers with my friends but had come to far to give up. I think once I did hit the bottom there was only one way to go and after that slowly I started feeling a bit happier and started to not mind eating the boring bland food and at one stadge got to a point where I was actually enjoying them! It does get better, but it does take time. Keep your mind as occupied as you can and try not to dwell on the whole situation, it’s hard to think about how bad your feeling when your too busy other things. Distraction is key. Benji"
6,mandyb,607,I also really don’t consider myself an emotional person but with this diet I have definitely felt quite emotional. Fortunately I had been warned about this side of it because a friend of a friend had been on the diet and this friend told me that one of the symptoms was being more emotional. I keep on having to remind myself that its just a normal part of it and that I mustn’t be too hard on myself (or others;) because my emotions are over the top.

I hope you get well soon!  yours Thomas"
8,Tuula,607,"Hi all emotional ones, I was one of them as well. And it was really terrible for the first 3 weeks or so. I just felt hopeless thinking that I can’t ever live normally again, have a restaurant dinner with my husband or friends. I had just spent one month without alcohol just voluntarily before I learned about my Candida. And that time I was at a couple of parties and it wasn’t so bad not to be drinking with others since I enjoyed all the food that was on offer, desserts and all. But now it is actually pretty boring going to a party where most foods are not made for someone on my diet, so I can’t even enjoy that, not to mention alcohol. One tip is to take something you like with you to the party, I bring my own raw chocolate made from coconut oil, raw cacao and stevia. That keeps me awake at a late night party… That has been ok in the later stages of the diet."
0,ataris,608,Hi everyone. I’m new here and starting the diet from tomorrow. Everything seems pretty straight forward (while it will be super difficult) but the only thing I know I’m not going to be able to cut out is Alcohol. Does anyone have any suggestions? Any types that arn’t as bad and what is the worst to stay away from? I’d love to say I would cut it out but I’m 23 and work a 6-7 day week and it’s an outlet in life I won’t give up. Advice is sincerely appreaciated! Thanks

Then unfortunately you won’t be giving up your Candida infestation either. The diet, probiotics, and antifungals ‘may’ be able to lessen the effects, but you’ll never cure the infestation while drinking alcohol on a regular basis, any type. Able"
2,Sash,608,"Hi, Im exactyl the same…im 19, every outing/social event i attend invloves ALCOHOL. Its an absolute nightmare! especially with the diet stating NO ALCOHOL whatsoever at any stage. Im finding it so so difficult, i feel i cant enjoy myself properly when everyones drinking around me and im stone cold sober. Unfortunatly, thats just how it is :-/ .. alcohol will feed the candida and from personal experience, it really is a big set back. Ive been following the diet for almost a year now and have had nightouts drinking, its pretty apparrent that alcohol aggrivates the candida. Vodka would be your ‘safest’ drink, just drink in moderation and steer well clear of beer, cider and sugar alchopops. Good Luck!"
3,Tuula,608,"Hi, on this note about alcohol.. Has anyone experience about having wine after about 4-5 months on the candida diet and when you don’t have any symptoms anymore, when candida should be under control? I know it’s probably best to try an organic red wine to at least stay clear off the preservatives. I’d like to hear people’s experiences, does Candida come right back at you if you have a couple of wines every now and then? I’m really missing the days when I could have a few bubblies with the girls! But sparkling wine has lots of sugar in it so I won’t dare to try that."
0,Martin,609,"Hello, New here. – 14 years with Ulcerative Colits. – Had my large intestine taken out in 2005. – Been feeling AMAZING and 100% for last 5 years (eat whatever I want whenever) – 3 weeks ago started with bad taste in the mouth, now oral candida – Old UC stomach symptoms are back Could be that my j pouch is infected (Pouchitis) I guess the Candida and Uc might all be related. Can only talk to my secialist in Jan, so really bummed out because I feel I might need the proper meds to get better. About a week into testing the Candida diet. Feel dizzy all day, totally dehydrated, no energy, starved. Doing my best to kill off the bacteria by following diet on this site, but wondering about a few things: 1 – I’ve read conflicting things. BEEF is on the list, so a few days ago I bought a few pieces of filet migon. Is this ok or not? (if not why is beef on the ok list?) 2 – I’ve read everywhere that BUTTER is no good, but ORGANIC BUTTER is on the list of things that are ok. (what’s the difference?) Is it under the list for OILS … are they talking about something different then the slab of organic butter I bought (maybe like a organic butter oil or something?). I can put this butter on everything I eat? 3 – I drink alot of sparkling water, I found one with less sodium than Perrier called S.

Just the eggs whites, or can full egg be eaten? 5 – BREADS – what kind if any can I get? I will no doubt have more questions as I wiggle my way around this new situation of mine, any replies and help are much appreciated. Thank you, Martin"
1,Able900,609,"1 – I’ve read conflicting things. BEEF is on the list, so a few days ago I bought a few pieces of filet migon. Is this ok or not? (if not why is beef on the ok list?) Reply: Beef is not alright on the diet as it releases alcohol gases into your body when the proteins break down. Alcohol and alcohol gases contribute to a beneficial environment for the Candida. To answer your question, beef is on this site’s “ok list” because, other than the forum, the site is very much out of date. Read this post: The Site’s Suggestions: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst968_THE-SITES-SUGGESTIONS.aspx Also, if the beef isn’t purely organic it contains antibiotics and hormones, not at all beneficial to the Candida treatment. 2 – I’ve read everywhere that BUTTER is no good, but ORGANIC BUTTER is on the list of things that are ok. (what’s the difference?) Is it under the list for OILS … are they talking about something different then the slab of organic butter I bought (maybe like a organic butter oil or something?). I can put this butter on everything I eat? Reply: The only type of ‘butter’ that is acceptable is ghee, which you can find on the Internet. All dairy products should be completely avoided as they can feed the Candida. 3 – I drink alot of sparkling water, I found one with less sodium than Perrier called S. Pellegrino: Is this ok to drink? Reply: Sparkling water is generally a carbonated drink. Carbon dioxide gas is used to make all carbonated waters, therefore club soda, soda water, sparkling water, or seltzer water are all types of water into which carbon dioxide gas has been dissolved, and carbon dioxide is a type of toxin as well as a waste product. This means more work for the liver which is already overworked because of the Candida toxins. What’s wrong with plain water? You stated that you had been “totally dehydrated;” this is typical with a Candida albicans infestation if enough water isn’t consumed. And please understand that I’m talking about “water” and not a drink containing such chemicals as chlorine which will kill the beneficial bacteria in your sytem which are needed to destroy the Candida. It also contains nitrates which destroys vitamins A, C and E in your system.  You need to be drinking more water than you’ve ever drank before in order to prevent dehydration and to keep the Candida toxins washed from your system 4 – I’ve heard conflicting things about eggs – what’s the bottom line. Just the eggs whites, or can full egg be eaten? Reply: The entire egg should be eaten for the extra proteins. Organic is best if you can get them as they contain no antibiotics or hormones. 5 – BREADS – what kind if any can I get?

One doesn’t need to ‘experience’ a problem with a product in order to study the research published on the tangibility of the product, therefore being aware of each fact concerning the results of the break-down of each ingredient in the product.  The forum’s purpose is to ask questions and inform readers of problems ‘before’ they’re made, not to personally test every product which is a scientifically proven problem. “I have 3 bakeries around me, any that I can buy at all?” I have no way of knowing since I have no idea of what the ingredients are.

4,Tuula,609,"Martin, I did not eat and still don’t eat any bakery baked foods including breads. They have yeast in them and that is definitely something to avoid when on Candida diet. I know it is a lot of work to cook everything yourself but it is quite easy to bake yeast free bread from whole grains. Since no white or refined flours are allowed either.

0,vpiper77,615,"Hi all, I kinda discovered this one by accident. In any case for those of you that have tried and used ACV (apple cider vinegar) to help with candida symptoms I found another vinegar that is much stronger and more aggressive but is very difficult to obtain. It has the highest acetic acid content and works alot faster for clearing out your body but it is not sold here in the united states. Its called Oak Tree Vinegar and its a byproduct of charcoal. It is produced mostly in thailand or korea and if you live in a city with a chinatown or asian markets you may be able to find it.. In any case I was using it as a spray for a skin condition psoriasis and it worked so well I experimented with drinking it in the same concentrations as the ACV.. I did find some Oak tree vinegar on ebay but it is a bit more expensive than ACV. Here is a link that explains the benifits http://drhildy.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=oakysmokey&action=display&thread=12 CAUTION: this vinegar is much more powerful and stronger than ACV and it smells like a forrest fire or burned wood so be careful if you try this and start slowly..

0,Veggie,616,"Hi, english is not my Best. Iv had male candida rash and still have the cream dont really dó the work totaly, it always come back. Plus iv had it in my hair, not sure whats that called but the white stuff there, and that shampoo dossent dó its work there eather. So im planing to go ón a candida diet. I started to eat 3-5 raw garlic a day, drink some olive oile. Eliminate fast carbs like fruit, pasta White bread and milk. Basicly i eat Morning oat with water Midday veggies, tofu, dark bread Evening Brown Rice veggies, salad beans tofu and lors of water Im between some beans , and veggies. Is that the right way to dó it? And for how long u Think i should be ón that kind of diet to get it in balance? Or is there some other thing i could use since my candida is only in local areas. Never felt All the mental things about it,accept i easy get muschels cramps. Thanks"
1,Able900,616,"Hello, Veggie, and welcome to the forum. For breakfast I suggest eating eggs in place of the oats. They can be boiled or even cooked as an omelet with such foods as onions, peppers, or even a spinach omelet. Also, the coconut flour bread recipe is a great idea for all three meals, especially with eggs. Keeping boiled eggs on hand all the time will work well as a quick nutritious snack. For your own sake, leave out any type of soy products including the tofu for as long as you have any Candida symptoms at all. I would only eat the beans once a day if that often. The more fresh green vegetables you eat, the better off you’re going to be.  Leave out the brown rice altogether for the time being. You definitely need to replace some of your food items with fresh green vegetables. What is in the ‘dark bread’ that you eat? Stay strictly on the diet for about two weeks before you add any type of antifungal (and remain on the diet). Read the post titled “Die-off, IBS, LGS & Candida Connection” dated Sept. 17 under “General Discussions” because this diet can cause die-off to occur. I can’t tell you how long you will be on the diet because everyone is different and each person has different degrees of the infestation, plus the longer you’ve had the infestation the longer it generally takes to cure. Able"
2,Veggie,616,"Hi thanks for the reply The dark bread is the one u can get in health food stores , not sure what’s it’s called in english. but that one I was really in doubt if that was ok. Same with brown rice. What do u mean stay in the diet for two weeks before adding any anti fungal ? Is that cream or garlic? Okay I will add a lot of fresh greens that’s no problem. What about tomatos? And try beans only 4-5 times a week What about fresh garlic ? Eat as many as can ? What about cottage cheese? And yogurt ? Where to find the coconut flour bread recipe? Thanks"
3,Able900,616,"Hello, Veggie. “The dark bread is the one u can get in health food stores” Reply: What are the ingredients on the package? It’s possible you can still eat this, but if it contains wheat, you should leave it out of your diet. “What do u mean stay in the diet for two weeks before adding any anti fungal ? Is that cream or garlic?” Reply: Garlic eaten in any way is a good antifungal, but I’m talking about others which you should not start yet or together. We’ll discuss those as you progress with the diet because you do not need to start them yet because of the possibility of too strong a die-off episode. “What about tomatoes?” Reply: I would wait at least ten days. Then treat them as a test food. That means you’ll only eat a very small amount the first time, wait 48 hours before eating it again to see if you have a Candida reaction to the item. If you do, wait 7 to 10 days before trying it again, then do the same thing. If you receive no reaction at all, you could eat them perhaps two to three times a week. “What about fresh garlic ? Eat as many as can?” Reply: As much as you can eventually. For the time being I would limit it because of the diet alone being able to cause die-off symptoms which can be bad, and garlic will only add to this. “What about cottage cheese? And yogurt?” Reply: Leave the cottage cheese out altogether. In about two weeks you could try organic Greek non-sweetened yogurt but not regular yogurt. Treat it as a test food at that time. The coconut flour bread recipe is below and also in the recipe section of the forum. You should check out that section as you will probably find more interesting recipes to try. Coconut Flour Bread Ingredients: 9 Eggs 1/2 cup olive oil 1 cup + 3 oz. coconut flour (or a mixture of coconut flour, brown rice bran flour, & milled flax seed equaling a total of 1 cup 3 oz.)  3/4 teaspoon Celtic or Himalayan Sea Salt  1 1/2 teaspoon aluminum-free baking soda Directions: Mix all dry ingredients together, then mix the eggs and oil together and blend thoroughly with the dry ingredients. Place into an oiled glass loaf pan pressing the loaf making it firm in the baking dish. Bake at 345 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes. The top should be a golden brown color depending on types of flour used. Coconut flour alone will produce a lighter colored bread with a golden top. The milled flax seed and the rice bran flour will produce a dark tan color bread with golden-brown top when done. Test with toothpick for dryness. Able"

It doesn’t matter what you tell me isn’t’ in it, I still need to know what it actually contains. I have no idea what the cream is so I couldn’t say. You could try massaging organic coconut oil into your skin where the Candida is located. But you’ll really have to address the problem from the inside out.

7,Able900,616,"As far as nuts are concerned, I say no, not until the 2nd stage and sometimes not even then. Although spelt is a different type of grain, it’s still a grain, so I’m afraid the answer is no. Even if the Candida may not feed on it immediately, they’ll adapt to spelt quickly.

1,Carb voyeur,618,"Oh, and can I take buttermilk on stage 1 as well?"
2,Able900,618,"Hello, Carb. The yeast of kefir doesn’t promote a Candida infestation. If there’s a problem caused by milk kefir, it would probably be because the kefir wasn’t fermented long enough to remove all of the sugar before it was shipped. You can take it during stage 1 for sure. Also at least part of the cultures will be alive even though it’s pasteurized. You can buy the grains and make it yourself which would be the best. If you decide to do this, use 1% Organic Valley Milk, that is if you can get that brand, if not, any brand would work. Look for the Rumford brand of baking powder which comes in a red container with white letters. It has the words “Aluminum-Free” printed across the front of the container. I wouldn’t drink buttermilk during any stage of the diet. Able"

My infestastion is still quite young, and therefore may be easier to shake…"
3,Able900,619,"Hello, and welcome to the forum. The time you’ve spent on the cleanse wasn’t wasted, unless you strayed from the protocol, and any amount of time won’t be wasted in the future unless you stray. The detox stage can last from one week to two weeks or even longer. It depends on you and how you feel with the protocol. Also, it often depends on whether or not the patient is working because sometimes more protein and food is needed for a person who is working on a daily basis among other activities. I can say that the longer you’re on the detox, the faster you will jump-start the treatment and, providing you do not stray from any stage of the treatment, the longer detox period will shorten the length of the overall treatment in most cases. Just decide which length of time you wish stay on the detox diet. After the initial detox period has ended for you, you’ll be ready for the regular Candida diet treatment; this is the part you will be on for a long time. Some people call it stage two, but in reality the more appropriate name would be the second part of the detox. When you start this, in the beginning you would add at least one antifungal to your regimen. In addition, more protein in the way of chicken and fish would be alright in most cases. If at that time you’re not already taking Molybdenum, I would suggest purchasing this in pill form. It’ll be very helpful when the die-off symptoms start, plus it will protect your liver from the toxins which the dying Candida will release. During this time I would also recommend various vitamin supplements to be added if you’re not already taking them. These would be A & D, plus extra D3 capsules, vitamin E, vitamin C, calcium and magnesium. I do not advocate multiple vitamins at all for various reasons, all having to do with health issues. After about three weeks from starting the detox/diet, and depending on how you’re doing at the time, you could try testing organic non-sweetened Greek yogurt. Let me know if you have questions, and congratulations on making the decision to start your treatment. Able"
4,Carb voyeur,619,"Lovely! Thank you for getting back to me so promptly. I’m doing the Bentonite and Psyllium, and Liver drink, so hopefully if I keep this up for another few days without yoghurt, I’ll be ok to move on to the main Candida diet. When you say; “After the initial detox period has ended for you, you’ll be ready for the regular Candida diet treatment; this is the part you will be on for a long time.” how long do you mean? The 7 weeks of detox and elimination after the cleanse, plus some time for slow reacclimatisation to a new lifestyle, or longer than that again? Is there anything else the main site gets wrong? I thought I’d be able to eat Almonds fairly soon, since they’re candida fighting, but apparently I still have to keep off them? Thank you again."
5,Able900,619,"“I’m doing the Bentonite and Psyllium, and Liver drink” I covered the psyllium in my post “This Site’s Suggestions.” Quote: “I absolutely advise against the detox drink suggested by the site because of the psyllium husk. The bad thing about psyllium husk is that it’s very hard on the intestines because of the sharpness and hardness of the small shards of husks which can cause lacerations as it passes through the intestines which in turn can cause internal bleeding. In addition, it can also cause heavy bloating in some people.”  Even the powder form can contain small shards of the husks which can cause lacerations in the lower intestines. Drink pure fresh lemon water instead three or four times a day using a whole lemon, this works perfectly as a detox liquid.  “When you say; ‘After the initial detox period has ended for you, you’ll be ready for the regular Candida diet treatment; this is the part you will be on for a long time.’  “how long do you mean?” Reply: This depends on how you react to the initial period. I never plan when a particular person can stop one period and start another until I see that he’s ready. Every single Candida sufferer is different and everyone responds to the treatment different, so as I’ve said before, there is no set timeline that fits everyone.  “Is there anything else the main site gets wrong?” Reply: I try avoid the sites instructions, but I imagine so.  “I thought I’d be able to eat Almonds fairly soon, since they’re candida fighting, but apparently I still have to keep off them?” Reply: I’ve had most types of nuts tested myself, including almonds, and even organic nuts sometimes a bit of mold, regular nuts always do, and this is why most sufferers receive Candida reactions to them. This is not something you want to ingest when you have a Candida albicans infestation. I doubt seriously that they are “Candida fighting” considering the negative aspect.  Able"

At least three whole, fresh lemons a day in water; how many times you wish to divide the three is up to you, such as three glasses of water or a half lemon in six different glasses during the day. For a liver cleanse I would also use Molybdenum pills. You can take up to 250 mcg three times a day. Other good natural liver cleansers are yucca root herbs, turmeric and milk thistle. One of the best liver cleansers around is something called Digestive Grape Bitters which comes in a liquid form. Bitters have a wide range of applications in liver disease. Grape Bitters also stimulate the repair of the intestinal wall lining or mucosa during a Candida infestation, and should always be taken after a good meal.  Ignore the teaspoon of bitters recommended on the bottle and only use about a half a dropper full of the bitters before, during or after meals. During a short liver cleanse I would eat green salads or steamed green vegetables and organic eggs when necessary, and lots of water. Able"
0,Carb voyeur,620,"Hello! Very new to this. I’m currently on the cleanse part (I’m doing Option 3, but for 2 weeks, to compensate for not doing the irrigation or the… you know… starving myself…). I’m 11 days in. I’ve been having steamed greens every morning for breakfast, but to keep it interesting for myself, and to insert a little Cayenne into my diet, I’ve been making a raw tomato sauce to put on it. Just a little tinned tomato puree (No Citric Acid, it’s Roma brand, just tomato and salt), a little sea salt, pepper, a little cayenne (I lashed it in one morning. That was a very abrupt wake up!), and a teensy bit of apple cider vinegar, mixed in with cold water, and put over the hot veg. It’s actually very tasty and fills me up nicely for the morning, but I was just wondering if at all sounds ok to the Candida experts? It’s all going well so far, although I had to drop a few things during the week. (Are salted cashews alright? It’s not on your Don’t List, but I suspect anything that delicious has to be delicious to fungus as well…. I dropped it just in case.) Anywho, this has turned into a very long post. Very happy to find a resource like this!"

2,Able900,620,"Generally I don’t like to advocate canned foods of any type. However, if you’re using a small amount of the puree and receiving no reaction from it, I suppose using it once or twice a week woudn’t be too harmful, hopefully. Nuts should be left out of the detox period and for as long as possible afterwards. I believe I addressed your yogurt question on your other post: “After about three weeks from starting the detox/diet, and depending on how you’re doing at the time, you could try testing organic non-sweetened Greek yogurt.” Able"
3,Sharon,620,"I am no expert. I am two weeks on the diet. But from what I gather, the reason why canned tomatoes are not okay is due to the citric acid. If there isn’t any in there than sounds to me like problem solved. However, I try to stay away from canned products because the cans are coated with BPA, which is a harmful chemical – but also chemicals can disrupt your friendly bacteria and allow the Candida yeast to flourish (according to this website)."

0,dazzammm,621,"Hi, any fellow suffers got any good tips for this lovely combination of conditions ?"
1,Able900,621,"Hello. Wow, quite a combination. I’d be interested in knowing if your doctor or doctors diagnosed both Candida and Gilbert’s Syndrome, especially since a lot of the symptoms are so similar. You probably already know just about everything there is to know about Gilbert’s Syndrome by now, but if you don’t mind, I’ll explain what I know about it for the benefit of anyone who may be reading the posts unaware of exactly what the condition is. The majority of scientists who have researched Gilbert’s Syndrome claim that it’s an inherited condition. What it amounts to is the inability of the body to detoxify bilirubin; bilirubin being a toxin produced by the breakdown of red blood cells. The reason this happens is because only about 30% of the enzyme that detoxifies bilirubin is produced when Gilbert’s Syndrome is present. The shortage leads to an excess of bilirubin as well as other toxins in the blood leading to various symptoms, many very similar to Candida symptoms. I can’t help but believe that the supplement Molybdenum, an essential trace element found naturally in the human body, would make the condition more easily tolerated simply because it’s the best detox supplement of body toxins that I know of.  In addition, I’m sure that any nutrient which would produce activation of the missing enzyme would be of benefit. A few of the foods that are inducers of detoxification enzymes are broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts. I would eat at least one of these every day. Certain nutrient deficiencies have been linked to Gilbert’s Syndrome. So I would want to obtain sufficient amounts of those. They are: Vitamin B2, B5, folic acid, B12, vitamin C, selenium, zinc, and Molybdenum. The fact that there are four different B vitamins that are especially needed for a treatment would lead me to believe that a high quality and count of probiotics, Greek yogurt, and kefir would be beneficial. Of course this would also benefit the Candida treatment as well. It makes sense to me that the strict Candida diet would also be of benefit.  Plus, a high protein diet is beneficial to the treatment, so since you have Candida as well, I would suggest eating an abundance of organic eggs in order to cut down or out the intake of red meat. The thought of red meat reminds me that, of course, you want to cut out any foods which would cause additional toxins in the body. Able"
0,Able900,622,"A Candida albicans infestation often causes brain fog, and the reason that it’s is able to do this is very easy to understand. If you know much about a Candida infestation, you probably know that you are constantly absorbing alcohol because the yeasts/Candida are continually converting any small amount and any type of sugar into alcohol. Alcohol is alkalizing and therefore creates the perfect environment for the Candida. I imagine most of us know that drinking alcohol can create a certain form of “brain fog.” In addition, the large amount of alcohol gases will also congest the liver, which is an additional and major factor in the cause of brain fog. The liver acts as a filter for the blood, and if it’s congested, it cannot remove the toxins (such as alcohol) from the bloodstream fast enough. The toxins will pass through the blood-brain barrier therefore depriving the brain of oxygen and glycogen, and again, causing brain fog. Able"
0,ajbjcallahan,623,"Hey everyone — I’m on day 2 of the cleanse portion. I was planning on doing 3 days of the strict cleanse (broth, detox, liver drinks) and then move to raw salads with the drinks for an additional week. I should also mention, I couldn’t find the clay and chose to go with activated charcoal tablets instead, which many folks on this site recommended. The bottle says I can take them with or without food. So, this morning I drank my detox drink (and took the charcoal pills) and about 25 minutes later threw it all up. I’ve had similar problems in the past, putting “pills” on an empty stomach…any suggestions? I REALLY want to get rid of my candida and that’s why I chose doing a fast for three days first. I’m sick and tired of my symptoms. Any advice would be appreciated."

I also recommend visiting a naturopathic doctor for the best advice and treatment plan; they will get you healthier within weeks instead of months."
2,sage,623,"I question some of the information offered on the candida site and think you need to be careful with the detox regime. Not sure of your age either but in my opinion, it is important to go a little slower. Have you had a chance to read some of the previous posts (ie Cleanse & Detox Protocol and Die off Dangers)? Excellent information … I’m into my 3rd week & feeling better already. Did not use the strict Detox but instead drank a lot of water with lemon, followed a fairly strict diet, steamed many veggies (not just raw) and use so much fresh garlic, you would think I have a “vampire phobia” LOL. I’m 50 & perhaps more cautious than need be. Once I started taking Molybdenum, any die off symptoms were greatly minimized. I hope you feel better soon!"

Raster; Unless you’re continually advising people to see a naturopathic doctor without having visited one, I assume you’ve seen one yourself. When was your first visit with the naturopath? I’ve seen you post the statement quoted above before on the forum. That fact would apply only to someone with an extremely mild case of Candida and for only a very, very short period of time. The length fo time for a cure also depends on how long the person was on the diet before seeing the doctor. You’re probably giving a lot of people false hope with the statement, and when they’ve seen a naturopath, and still have the infestation a month or longer after the visit, they’re likely to think they’ve failed because they were unable to obtain a cure within a few weeks. Thanks, Able"
4,BenjiRixon,623," I agree with Able, After I had lab testing to confirm my candida overgrowth the lab pointed me in the same direction. So I arranged a phone consultation, a plan was made along with over £200 GBP worth of supplements that ‘I had to take’ and a diet where all I had to do was change my sugar in my coffee to sweetner, drink sugar free soda drinks, switch my White carbs to brown and drink dry white wine instead of beer! Surprise surprise it didn’t cure me or my now empty pockets. Waste of time money and effort even tho she knew I had a med/strong colonisation from test results.

0,anniroC:,624, Can someone tell me the difference between the citric acid in diet pop vs. lemons and grapefruit? why is it ok to eat lemons and grapefruit on this diet… but not drinks that have citric acid in it?
1,Able900,624,"It’s not so much the citric acid in fruits that are ‘bad’ for Candida sufferers, but the fact that they’re alkalizing foods plus most are high in sugar. Lemons are also alkalizing, but are an excellent detoxing agent; other fruits are not mainly because of their high sugar content. One of two major problems with soda is the sugar content, and it doesn’t matter if you drink a diet soda or not, the types of sugar substitutes used will feed the Candida just the same as regular sugar will. The other problem is that they’re carbonated, this means that carbon dioxide gas was used to make the drink, which means that the gas was dissolved in the liquid. Carbon dioxide is nothing but a waste product, in other words just another toxin for the liver to deal with in addition to all the toxins the Candida releases. In addition, when mixed with water it forms carbonic acid which depletes minerals from the teeth and bones. Able"

3,Able900,625,"amack1841 wrote: Also, what antifungals? You really should start by reading the posts on the forum. You can learn a lot that will help you through your treatment. The answer to most – if not all of your questions are on the forum. If you can’t find a particular subject, certainly you should ask about it.  If you’ve only been on the diet for four days, wait at least another seven days before starting any antifungals or probiotics. The reason for this is that the diet normally causes die-off symptoms, and if it does, the antifungals and probiotic will only add to the die-off sickness. To help with the constipation, you can start taking two teaspoons a day of the coconut oil, the next day add another spoon, then move up to four teasspoons. Contact the forum again after that, or before, to let us know how you’re doing with the coconut oil. Be sure to purchase only the “organic” pure coconut oil from a health food store.

0,raster,626,"It is getting to that time again during the year! If you have a poorly ventilated bathroom (one that doesn’t have a fan), you need to be very concerned about mold/mildew in your bathroom. If left untreated, it can completely coat the walls and everything inside your bathroom. Or even worse, it can spread throughout your apartment and/or pad and coat everything that you own. For instance, if you allow/get mold/mildew on your towel, and then use it to dry-off…guess what!? You feel completely itchy all day long because you are very sensitive to it because of candida. Congestion, headaches, etc are typicaly symptoms of being ill from mold. Mold can really set you back during the candida diet and its best to clean it with bleach/vinegar. If possible, have someone else do this because you can get ill from the dead mold in the air. Good bathroom paint can really help prevent mold from forming in your bathroom. For instance, Sherwin-williams has a great bathroom paint that has anti-mold properties(i once worked for them). Hope this helps; a little bit of a mold problem can turn into a major one really fast, so its best to be aware of it and take appropriate action."

3,Able900,627,"I’ve never been able to figure out how soy products in general came to be such a well known and so-called ‘health food’ – because they’re not, and this includes any product made from soy such as soy milk. Normally soy products of any type should not be eaten if you have Candida, and in my opinion, at any other time as well. Here are just a few reasons for the above statement. Soy is plentiful in phytates which are capable of blocking the uptake of essential minerals as well as nutrients that the body needs to exist. Soy also contains large amounts of toxins such as enzyme inhibitors. It’s known to reduce the digestion of proteins, causing chronic deficiencies in amino acids. They can disrupt the function of the endocrine system (hormones and glands). Soy is also notorious for its high levels of aluminum. Did you ever hear the saying, “Real men don’t eat tofu”? About 2000 years ago, tofu, a soy product of course, was used to promote sexual abstinence in monasteries. This was possible because the phytoestrogens soy contains can lower testosterone levels. Maybe there’s actually something to the saying after all. Today, the soy milk sold in stores is a highly processed and full of the toxins that occur in soy. It’s also full of additives to make it more palatable. I would suggest, if you’re looking for a substitute for regular milk, try either goat’s milk or perhaps almond milk.

Hello, Sage. I suggest the time for a poster to start a new antifungal depending on their particular symptoms at the time; also, depending on the current antifungal or supplement, sometimes it’s best to simply increase the supplement they’re already taking. If you stop experiencing die-off symptoms, generally that’s a good clue that it’s fairly safe to start a new antifungal or raise a dosage.

1,Able900,634,"The “High Potency Tri-Blend Acidophilus Complex” only contains three strains of bacteria; this isn’t enough strains or total count (20 billion) to cure a Candida infestation. The “Clove Bud” doesn’t contain enough of any one herb to do more than put a slight dent in the infestation, if that. Same for the “Essential Male Multi” – plus, it only contains three B vitamins which isn’t a good idea because it can cause a person to become deficient in the ones that are not provided. The FOS isn’t bad I suppose, the only problem with taking pure FOS is that it will often cause intestinal gas.

3,Able900,634,"Hi, Spooked. If you’re considering purchasing the grapefruit seed extract that you mentioned earlier, don’t waste your money as it normally has an effect on the Candida for only 2 to 4 weeks at the most, then the Candida become resistant to the extract. Oil of oregano as well as coconut oil and pure garlic are different as the Candida cannot become resistant to these. Able"
4,Spooked,634,"Hi Able, Yeah I’d read that about GSE somewhere, I will just leave that one I think. Garlic won’t be a problem, I always like to keep a supply in my kitchen. And as for the Oil of oregano, I take it a liquid form would be more potent than capsules? What sort of strength should I be looking to take ideally? Thanks again, Spooked"
5,Able900,634,"Hello. The best quality of oregano oil is a liquid form called “Oreganol P73” made by North American Herb & Spice. Amazon carries it as well as health food stores and vitamin shops. Start with three drops a day divided into three different doses, but this depends on how long you’ve been on the diet as well as the coconut oil and garlic. Able"
6,Spooked,634,"Thanks again Able, I will wait until my next payday and see about getting the oregano oil. I have to be honest though, I’m not fully ‘on’ the diet at the minute as I’m still having small amounts of carbs and am drinking beetroot juice. I’m working my way in gradually. When I’m totally ‘on’ the diet I’ll have another serious think about suppliments/anti-fungals etc. My fear is that if I do too much at once, I’m more likely to become overhwelmed and give up. That might sound daft, but it worries me. Hope your weekend is going well, it’s nearly over here in the UK."
0,JustJoe,635,"Hello all, new to this forum, but not to candida. I’ll apologize now for the long introduction. I’m a self-diagnosed candida sufferer. It’s pretty clear; taken online questionnaires and scored off the charts. I did a 3-month mini-candida diet about 7 years ago with good results, but wasn’t very strict about it, and thus symptoms came back about 2 years ago. So this time in, I went in full force. Basically, my diet has consisted of mostly fresh meats (unfortunately I don’t have the money to buy non-GMO, grain-fed, no-anti-biotic meats), like chicken, uncured pork, fish, shrimp, ground beef and steak. I’ll eat most vegetables (some are considered fruit in terms of genus), usually fresh, but some canned. Typically, celery, lettuce, cucumbers, avocados, spinach, tomatoes, pepers, spaghetti squash, broccoli. I also eat lots of beans, black, garbanzo, chickpeas, etc. I try and use good oils like olive oil. However, I am probably eating some things that may not be beneficial. Like I’ll eat canned tomatoes for making pasta sauce, which I know has citric acid. I didn’t eat oats until about month 4 and I’ve heard contradictory evidence for oats, because while it does contain gluten, it is a different kind or something like that. I don’t totally avoid stuff like citric acid, and do drink soy milk. I eat eggs, but for the most part I’ve avoided most candida-friendly foods. If I do use something I shouldn’t I’m not doing it a lot, like canola oil, if I do use it, it is so sparingly. Over the past 6 months, I’ve gone from having myriad symptoms, like brain fog, confusion, lack of memory, depression, IBS, diarrhea, ezcema, itching (all over), constant colds, sinus problems, headaches, sleep problems, and so so much more. In fact, when I took the questionnaire again at 4 months, I went from a super high score of 450 to around 65, (the 65 being slight to moderate, but nearly out of candida). Like I said, I thought I’ve adhered strictly to the diet, plus I have used many anti-fungals. I’ve doubled and tripled up many times. Pau D-Arco almost every day. Myrrh, spilanthes, grape fruit seed extract, oregano oil, a combo of psyllium/caprolyl/bentonite, raw fresh garlic, and a few others. Plus, I’ve been using probiotics on a consistent basis, and taking tons of quality vitamins and minerals. I exercise regularly too. But just recently, I went out to eat for my birthday and ordered some Grecian lamb. I thought Grecian meant olive oil/garlic, etc. So did my wife. However, it came back in a bechemel sauce (milk, flour, mushrooms). But since this was a fancy-smacy place, I didn’t want to send it back so I figured since I was doing so well, I’d just scrape off the sauce and a little wouldn’t hurt me. That same day, I also had a banana, a so called forbidden fruit. Plus, I had a communion wafer that same day (minor amount of wheat)… all in all, I probably did have some things that shouldn’t be eaten on the candida diet, but not really for someone who has been doing this for 6 months, and gone so far (so bad to so good) and been doing the program aggressively… not to mention I only had amounts so small they shouldn’t even be worrisome. Yet, since that time 8 days ago, my stomach has been reeling…! IBS is back, I’m tired more than normal and I feel more depressed today. WHAT GIVES? I can’t believe (I don’t want to believe) that I’ve been doing this ALL WRONG for 6 WASTED MONTHS."
1,raster,635,"Joe, Like you I have been very ill (for about 9 months now). I first decided to go with a less-strict diet like yourself eating pasta, grains, fruits, sugar, bread, etc for about 8 months. I am not quite over candida, so I probably don’t have the best advice, but you just gotta tough it out and follow the strict diet. No bread, mushrooms, forbidden fruits, don’t cheat at all. 3-9 weeks, or later depending on your body, you should be completely over it. I have been doing acupuncture every 2-3 weeks for about 6 months now and have been on the candida diet for the last 3 weeks. Nothing but chicken and rice pretty much to eat and it sucks. My diet: Yogurt/blueberries and rice cereal for breakfast, salad and sunflower seeds for lunch, and meat and rice for dinner. Rice cakes for snacks, one green apple per day. I am still having salad dressing which isn’t helpful and I’m a smoker. I have also taken 3 supplements that are not mentioned here on this website: they include SMI powder, candicid forte, and lactobicilis sporogenes. You cannot buy these in stores and only online. Talk to a (naturopathic) doctor first before taking these, but they greatly helped me get over it with the diet. 3 weeks into this regimen I am almost completely over it. I am going to do the diet 1-2 more weeks and may eliminate coffee, salad dressing, and maybe the green apple during this time. It has greatly helped and I hope I can get over it like you. I just want life to return to normal (gradually)."
2,Able900,635,"JustJoe wrote: WHAT GIVES? I can’t believe (I don’t want to believe) that I’ve been doing this ALL WRONG for 6 WASTED MONTHS. Hello, Joe, and welcome to the forum. Hate being blunt, but to put it in your own words, you’re doing it wrong. So many people think that being on the Candida diet means ‘a little’ of this and a little of that, but actually that’s exactly why some Candida sufferers write messages on forums stating that they’ve been suffering with Candida for 5, 6, 7 or even 10 to 20 years and can’t figure out why. When I had Candida at its worse, I was receiving a reaction from practically every single bite of food I put into my body no matter what it was. Even so, once I decided to stick to the diet 100% while working to destroy at least part of the Candida, I healed the infestation to the point of zero reactions and zero symptoms in three to four months. I was able to do this because once I realized just what it would take to be rid of it and didn’t change my course until the end. In fact, months later I’m basically still on the diet simply because I believe it’s the healthiest diet any of us could be on. If you’re serious about curing your Candida, then you will need to stop eating everything that is affecting the Candida infestation. That means to get rid of the black beans, garbanzo, and chickpeas for at least one month while you follow the diet. It also means to get rid of all canned foods. If you feel you have to have tomatoes, eat them fresh from a market or grow your own if it’s possible. You can make your own tomato sauce yourself with a cheap food chopper and save money in the long run, but eat them either very sparingly or not at all for at least one month. About canned foods; most canned foods, vegetable or otherwise, contain the cheapest form of salt available. The cheapest form of salt is regular table salt which contains Dextrose. If you have a box of regular Mortons table salt, look at the ingredients. Dextrose is a type of sugar which, as you know, Candida thrive on. This also goes for eating out during the critical period of the diet, because I doubt that many restaurants use anything but the cheapest salt they can buy instead of pure sea salt. Once you start eating beans again, you can purchase dried beans instead of canned (if this is what you’re doing). You wrote, “Like I said, I thought I’ve adhered strictly to the diet, plus I have used many anti-fungals.” To be honest you haven’t been following your treatment or diet “strictly” as you stated because you’ve been eating all of the foods I named above. Second, all of the antifungals you were using were going to waste. What you were doing was like being in a battle and shooting your enemy and then sending your own medics to treat and bandage them so that they could fight again. It’s the very same thing because what you were doing was killing some of the Candida and then feeding the others so that they could increase their numbers. Do you see the picture? I know of no one who has cured a Candida infestation without probiotics, so it’s good that you’ve been taking these. What is the count and number of strains in yours? You wrote that the banana you ate was a forbidden fruit. Yes, and for a good reason. An average size banana contains 30 grams of carbs and about 28 grams of sugar. So you literally gave the Candida you’re housing a king’s feast. Since you’re not eating organic meats, and I assume you’re eating and I assume you’re eating non-organic meat at least once every day, you have the same scenario as feeding and killing the Candida. You’re using probiotics to build up the beneficial flora in your body, but you’re taking an antibiotic every day that has the potential of killing it, thus increasing the chance that the Candida have to survive. I didn’t eat meat or chicken at all for a while on the diet because I wanted to be rid of the Candida as quickly as possible, and I believed this would be beneficial to my goal; instead I ate lots of organic eggs which I knew would make a suitable substitute for meat protein. By the way, organic eggs are a lot cheaper than organic meat. Able"
3,JustJoe,635,"I don’t mean to be taken as defensive, but the banana was after 5-1/2 months. I haven’t cheated, technically, of my own free will from the diet I’m doing. I may be doing it “wrong” according to this site’s method, but there are 1,000’s of candida diets out there and all are different. I’ve also never heard of not having beans at all on a candida diet. My goal is to rid myself of this so please don’t take this as being defensive. I have only eaten fresh meats, vegetables (mostly fresh, some canned), rice products, beans (which I’ve never heard anywhere else as being bad for candida), eggs, water, almonds. My diet consists mainly of 3 eggs for breakfast. For lunch I’ll usually have a chicken salad (lettuce, onions, peppers, tomatoes, chicken), and for dinner homemade hummus and meat. I can’t be too far off. The episode I’ve described was not a cheat, but an accident that I regret. The banana was a mistake as I figured that during month 4 I had NO symptoms. None. Zilch. I thought I could handle it after being symptom free for a whole month. I have cut out all dairy, caffeine, sugars (in all forms: sucrose, dextrose, etc, plus artificials), alcohol, wheat, most grains (except rice grain). I guess I’m a little pissed because I thought I’ve been doing this right and I’ve just wasted 6 ******** months. I don’t honestly know WTF anymore, because almost every diet I’ve seen says ALL dairy should be cut out because it feeds candida, yet yogurt is allowed here. Plus so are non-aged cheeses. If one were to combine all the programs together to get what they could eat, it would amount to: 1) water 2) …"
4,raster,635,"Cut the tomatoes, cut the oats, cut the peppers, cut anything canned, go all organic everything. Don’t eat any yellow, red, or orange vegetables. Are you taking any medications? They may contain ingredients not allowed on the diet. Try quitting these items for a few weeks if you can. You may also want to quit the beans and go without them for a few weeks to see if you notice any difference. They are allowed during phase 2 of the diet. Quite possibly eating those foods that one day caused candida to come back. That is unfortunate if its the case. Additionally, seafoods may contain harmful toxins (especially bottom feeders such as crabs, muscles, etc). Non-organic meats contains pharmies that may be harmful to you during the diet. Just tough it out a few weeks-months and buy organic everything (farmer’s markets have cheap veggies). Your health is more important than your pocketbook (while getting over candida). OH CUT THE SOY MILK! SOY anything is not allowed. This is probably the worst thing that has allowed it to persist. Cut the citric acid if you can also. Your body may be really worn down to the point it cannot recover quickly. Maybe try acupuncture to get your body more balanced. It really has helped me."
5,JustJoe,635,"Why tomatoes, why peppers? Why orange, red, yellow? No medications. The beans and oats and soy I didn’t start until after 3 months, that’s 16 weeks. I’ve looked at this program and apparently this one doesn’t even go that long, so how could my outbreak by from that? The first 3 months I was strict vegetables, meat. So in essence, I actually did this diet 100% strictly. It wasn’t until Phase 2 that I started eating these other things like beans and soy and stuff. Another place I thought I trusted which has tons of valuable info says that soy is bad for you, but not because it is bad for candida. Can someone explain WHY it is bad? It looks like this Phase 1 is 3 weeks, then Phase 2 is 4 weeks and then Phase 3 is maintenance and adding back in foods. I did three times the amount of this diet’s Phase 1. I should be just fine. I probably had an allergic reaction to the wheat, but the problem is that I DON’T KNOW. I’m a very tired of getting so much different advice. It is hurting me more than helping. The problem is that I don’t believe anyone anymore because EVERY diet says THEY are THE ONLY ONES that know the right way. So what everyone is saying here on this forum is that I WILL BE CURED if I eat ONLY fresh vegetables and ORGANIC meat for 3 weeks. Just 3?"
6,raster,635,"Everyone’s body is different and it could take longer depending on how ill with candida you are. I am going to do the diet for 5 weeks. As far as yellow, red, and orange veggies…they contain sugars which make them that color. Tomatoes are specifically not allowed I believe because of the citric acid. Give it a try atleast. Soy is the top GMO food out there. It is bad because it doesn’t have many healthy properties. GMO foods can alter your genetics and your health (no scientific evidence of this of course). 99% of all soy is genetically modified or non-organic. Go organic because regular non-organic foods contain pesticides, herbicides, etc that are not helpful or healthy. GMO foods are specifically really bad. Don’t eat anything canned. Don’t eat any fruits; I only eat blueberries and green apples. Maybe talk to a naturopathic doctor, dietitian, etc and maybe it is not candida. Candida can cause other health problems/diseases. Also the mercury fillings in your teeth are supposedly bad for candida but I am not going to get into this. Get really healthy good (organic) yogurt. There is a brand here called “annie’s” yogurt which contains proteins that naturally kill candida."
7,raster,635,"One more idea: What kind of water are you drinking? Are you drinking water solely from the municipal water supply? I would consider trying purified bottled water. Municipal water supplies contain lead and other minute contantities of carcinogens which could set you back some. I know in places like Arizona and New mexico they use a ton of chlorine and the water is brownish colored. A lot of water contains (natural) bacteria and/or other micro-organisms that live in the pipes. Candida can still live on these. I am lucky to live in a place where we have some of the best water quality in the world…other locations are not as fortunate. Most supermarkets have those water filling up stations where its like really cheap. 2 gallons of other purified water can be about $1.50. It’ll last you a week or so. Make sure it says “pure” and not just filtered, etc. Pure water has different properties than “regular” water."
8,JustJoe,635,"Luckily the soy milk I drink is non-gmo, organic-certified. It is soy, water and vanilla flavoring. As far as the water, I filter mine at home with a purification system. Again, my issue is that I have done all the things you’ve said to do, but for much much longer than 3 weeks, then another 4 weeks. I did all of those for nearly 4 months before I even touched soy, or oatmeal. It wasn’t until 5-1/2 months I touched a banana. The problem becomes then if I’ve done ALL that, AND done it for nearly 3-4 times longer than expected, wtf? is going on with my body? I’ve thought, well maybe food poisoning, or a virus. The trouble is that I have no way of knowing…"
9,raster,635,"Hello Joe, I am into week 8 of my diet. All I can say is do your best to get as “pure” as possible. Test your body now and then to see whether you get a “reaction” to foods. For instance, try salad dressing. If you still get reaction than continue phase 1. There is also a spit test you can do (spit in water and see how it reacts, if it looks like jelly-fish tentacles, then you still have it). I am unsure what to do at this point because I am almost there myself where you were at when you posted this. Maybe cut coffee, cigarrettes (if you smoke), vitamin powders, etc. Look at the ingredients for everything you eat and make sure you aren’t feeding it any more. Cut all dairy. Get more exercise if you can. Try things like detox tea, the clay, garlic, etc. Make your liver stronger. Do not cheat on food items. I took 3 supplements that have really helped, maybe consider those. Get plenty of rest as well. Don’t overwork yourself either. Cut all environmental toxins if possible such as mold, dust, chlorine, chemicals, etc. The goal is to get your body to the most pure it can get. I do not know what it feels like to finally get to that point yet, but its not far away or out of reach."
0,whyitsme,636,"I just finished my first bottle of yeast fighters (by Twin Lab), and found it to be very effective. It is very strong, so you may want to work up to the 5 pill dose. Was taking just a couple pills for more maintenance. Seems to have a good combo of herbs, fiber and even probiotic. (also has garlic, so of course after 5 pills you keep burping the garlic. But this is the only downside).I originally bought at fred meyer for about $15 for 75 pills (20 day supply at full dose), but found for under $7 on amazon for next purchase. So if you want to try something else for a fungicide, I’d recommend it."
0,dkmichigan,637,"I came to this site a little over a week ago. Started with a neck rash in January 2010. First dr said dermatitis and gave me a steroid shot, oral steroids and an antibiotic. I had a full body rash within 24 hours. Second dr said fungal yeast infection….but me on difulcan, steroids and nystatin. I have no insurance and the neck rash comes back every 3-4 months. I got tired of spending money on symptoms and here i am.  July 1st went to the dr with same problem…got same treatment ..steroids and cream. 3 days after stopping the steroids it came back. I have been following this diet since July 14 and.initial rash is no longer weeping, but i have multiple new rash spots forming. On my thigh, back, right forearm and left elbow.  I live way out in the country and haven’t had the money to go into city to get supplements. Could this simply be die-off?"
1,Able900,637,"Hello and welcome to the forum. Since you’ve had the rash off and on for over a year, I can’t see how it could possibly be a die-off reaction. If you do have Candida, the rash is more than likely a yeast reaction. I would also suspect yeast because your rash grew worse after taking the antibiotic and steroid. An antibiotic will make the Candida worse by destroying the beneficial bacteria in your system. In addition, perhaps a steroid will cover the symptoms on a temporary basis, but if you have Candida, the steroids will not help to cure it. Steroids are capable of binding with the yeast which can suppress your immune response. By doing this it will only increase the colonization of the infestation causing the spread of the Candida to other cells. This fact, coupled with the antibiotic, is exactly why you had a full body rash within 24 hours of seeing the doctor. As you see, in many cases a regular MD can cause more harm than good to a person with a Candida infestation as they have no idea how to treat it. Staying strictly on the diet is your only hope of lessening the symptoms if you cannot purchase supplements. If you can list exactly what you are eating, I may be able to give you some advice in that area. Able"
2,dkmichigan,637,"These are the things I have been eating in various combinations since July 14th: Boiled chicken breasts Ground round Brown rice Spinich Romaine lettuce Tomatoes Poached eggs Boiled eggs Broccoli Olive oil Sauerkraut Salt and pepper The only supplements I have so far are cod liver oil pills and I just found some glucosamine chondroitin. I’m taking an over the counter yeast med called AZO yeast with probiotics. I live an hour from the city and haven’t made a trip to there yet. Haven’t been able to choke down plain yogurt…..but after the three weeks, will add yougurt with raspberries from the yard. The initial rash is drying up and the additional spots that started, but also have spread out like a puddle. I’m really bored with the food so any suggestions would be appreciated. Looking for a non-sugar recipe for mayonnaise so I have more on my salad than just olive oil. First one I tried didn’t turn out close. Forgot fluids…..mostly only drinking water….got a pack of herbal teas..peppermint and chamomile…but they didn’t satisfy my flavor craving, so I’m back to only water. Thanks for your response….I’m determined to do this. (I work in a convenience store and have a weakness for Debbie Cakes….but won’t touch them)"
3,Able900,637,"I would eat the chicken breasts only twice a week if it isn’t organic. For the time being, and for at least three or four weeks, I would leave out the brown rice as well. The only other possible problem I see on the list you made is the salt. If you’re using regular table salt, such as Mortons, look at the ingredients, if it contains “Dextrose” you should not have it at all as Dextrose is a sugar which will feed the Candia. Hopefully you can find a pure sea salt such as Celtic – and be sure to look at the ingredients. It shouldn’t have any ingredient other than sea salt. You mentioned raspberries; I would eat these perhaps no more than twice in a week. If your symptoms do not improve at all, you should stop them altogether. Concerning what you’re drinking; water is of course the best choice for any health-based died, especially Candida, but you could also drink lemonade made from real lemon. For sugar, use either Truvia or pure Stevia extract (no other type of Stevia). Able"
4,dkmichigan,637,"I’ll get sea salt today…who knew table salt had dextrose! I picked up aloe vera. And acidophilus capsules yesterday and started them.  I have an appointment with a dermatologist next week. Lymph nodes are visible over my neck and as I am a recovering alcoholic (23 years), I’d like to get my liver checked out. The new locations of the rash concerns me….but only will let the dr prescribe anti-fungal. NO MORE STEROIDS! Can knocking down the Candida cause an overgrowth of bacteria?

0,carrotflowers,638,"Hi there! I’m new to this site, and just a few weeks ago diagnosed myself with candidaisis. Here’s what happened (I’ll try to make it short..): In November, I had chronic tonsilitis, and was put on several rounds of antibiotics. Shortly thereafter, I got the tonsils taken out, and in my three-week recovery period, I was on yet another antibiotic, which they do to prevent infection of the surgical site. So, I got a bad case of oral thrush, where my mouth was burning, itching, and completely white! The Dr. put me on an antifungal, which seemed to work… Well, my “healing” process from the surgery seemed never-ending. I kept getting sick– colds, headaches, flu-type things, etc. And THEN, around January maybe, I got a full-blown attack– my hands and feet were numb and tingling, leg muscles sore and week, severe back and neck pain, the whole nine. After much online searching and consultation with a friend (who happens to be a holistic health counselor), I figured my thrush hadn’t fully gone away (and alas! my tongue was still white!). Case closed. Candida overgrowth, no doubt. So, for the past couple weeks, I’ve been sugar-free, taking herbal supplements and vitamins, maintaining my exercise and yoga regimen, and I feel LOADS better! I didn’t really experience severe “die-off” symptoms, aside from my usual ones, and being extra tired/foggy (and having tons of break outs on my face!!!) So my question is…. since I’m pretty sure I only really had this problem since December or January…. when is an appropriate time to reintroduce sugar (and alcohol)? I’m not planning to go crazy, since I’ve learned so much and feel amazing right now…. but, I have a box of girl scout cookies in my freezer with my name on it… do most candida sufferers stay on this diet (or some version of it — sans GS cookies!) for their entire life? Every website I’ve been on seems to suggest that… What do you all think???"
1,flipperflop,638,lol i was so thinking this the other day. one of those chocolate mint ones… mmmmm. ps. i dunno depends if you have an alergy/ intolerance to anything that is in it…i think…i dunt even know. I thnink thats what we all have in common.
2,Hope,638,"Take my comment with a grain of salt – I’ve been on this diet for 7.5 weeks, following it very strictly, but I’m no holistic practioner. From what I understand, those who need to stay on the deit indefinitely, never really took care of their overgrowth in a satisfactory way before reintroducing candida-feeding foods/alcohol. If you don’t stay on the diet (without cheating) long enough, you’re going to be very prone for an overgrowth recurrence, even if your symptoms have vastly improved. A little beer here, a little coffe there, and nibble of a donut – all these things are going to keep you from completely eradicating your excess yeast, and that girl scout cookie will be pushed farther and farther back. That said, it seems that once you’ve been on the diet *strictly* for a while, and have successfully reintroduced Stage 2 foods like beans, potatos, etc. *then* it’s time to start thinking about adding back some really big trigger foods. If you’re reintoducing foods slowly, as recommended, this whole process could take a while. And once it really is time to test for things like wheat, corn syrup, sugar… you’ll want to do so with each ingredient separately, not in one big cookie combination. If it were me, at this point, I’d probably start with a small amount of whole wheat and wait a little while, gradually increasing the whole wheat until I hit a fairly normal amount. If it all seemed a-ok, I’d probably try refined wheat flour (white all purpose) the same way. Sweeteners and alcohol would be the last things I’d reintroduce, and only if my other reintroductions went well. Probably not what you wanted to hear. It’d be nice if I could say, “Yes! Have a Thin Mint! It won’t bother your candida at all!” But, I really think a Thin Mint is probably further off than you’re hoping. If you go slowly though, and really do a thorough job of eliminating your overgrowth, it’s possible you may be able to enjoy Girl Scout cookies down the road w/ zero ill effects. Please don’t let this discourage you. If anything, let it be a big motivator to really stick it out and win not just a battle, but the whole war 🙂"
3,carrotflowers,638,"Thank you, Hope. I know you’re right… unfortunately. And I have held off on the cookies — I finally gave them away! I was on the diet for four weeks, and was extremely strict, but when I tried to reintroduce sweeter/starchier foods, some of my symptoms seemed to come back.. so I think Samoas (my cookie of choice) are the last thing I should be (or want to be, surprisingly) eating. But I’ve become way more positive throughout this process, and no longer think about what I’m forbidden to eat. I’ve definitely come a long way, so I really think I’ll be able to stick to it. Thank you, and best of luck!"
4,Hope,638,Check you out! You’re awesome for giving those cookies away!!! 🙂 GOOD JOB!
5,tumbleweed,638,"I think we fall in love with the texture, color, mouth feel of all the things that for some reason our body has told us-in no uncertain terms- ‘look this is not good for you’, so throw the girl scout cookies away, and create something that has perhaps a similar texture but without the sugar. All of this sugar stuff is such a part of our western culture, and eliminating the warm fuzzy response to these kinds of ‘treats’ has to become one’s personal inner dialogue. A serious sugar afficionada, I am learning to parent my urges, with positive replacements. What will work for you of course, is a nibble and taste of the’ good for you’ foods, until you happen to find something that really tastes great and is also good for you. I think we newbies have a learning curve ahead, and yes this diet is quite strict-but everyone who sticks with the candida food plan ( I like that term better than ‘diet’) continues to report how well they feel, the longer they do it."

9,Able900,638,"Unless it’s some type of substitute, chocolate contains caffeine; caffeine in any form is an adrenal stressor. The adrenals support the immune system, and without the immune system in its top form, infections and pathogen infestations such as Candida are extremely difficult to overcome. That’s another reason why so many Candida sufferers don’t have a successful treatment, poor adrenal function. Caffeine should really be completely avoided during any illness, infection, or infestation such as Candida. Agave nectar should be a test product (starting with a very low amount), as many sufferers react to it. Able"
0,mhmhellogoodbye,639,"Hello all, I am 20 years old and have been overweight my whole life. A few months ago I discovered the HCG diet and had TREMENDOUS success. Unfortunately, I gained back the whole 20 lbs I lost in a matter of a week or two. The friend I did it with has still kept all of it off. I thought this was strange so I started to do some research. I have determined that I most definitely have a very large candida overgrowth. My chiropractor has been testing me positive for yeast by kinesiology for years, but I never took it seriously because I didn’t know it played a role in weight loss. I have tried every diet out there, paid thousands of dollars for weight loss programs, etc. I am ready to be a normal weight. The symptoms that I experience that I contribute to candida is feeling like sugar is an absolute necessity to my diet. It’s like water to me, haha. I was on birth control for about a year and a half. I stopped taking it about 6 weeks ago once realizing that could make it worse. I’ve always had stomach issues with constipation and stuff. I had also thought I had vertigo because I’ve had strange dizzy spells throughout my life. In the last 2 years, my vision actually went completely white and I was blind for about 30 seconds-1 minute in about five different instances. I suspect this could also be from a candida overgrowth. Anyways, on to my questions! I’ve been trying to do as much reading as possible, but there is SO much out there. I’ve seen some websites that suggest one thing and others don’t. Like carrots and eggs, haha so confusing. First question, why do some of the recipes on this website have rice in them for stages 1, 2, 3…? We are supposed to completely avoid any yeast or grains for three weeks and then you can try eating grains in small quantities after that right? These are the supplements I have bought: – Pau d’Arco tea and capsules – Grapefruit Seed Extract – Total-yeast and total-para (supplements from my chiropractor) – Hemp Hearts – Lactobacillus Acidophilus from GNC Does this all sound good so far? I’ve read on here that coconut oil and flour sounds like something I should also get. I’m also going to throw garlic into everything possible. This website says to do the diet for three weeks and THEN start taking supplements. Is that what all of you did? I don’t understand why you wouldn’t just start taking everything at once. Any help or advice will be GREATLY appreciated! -Lauren"
1,Hope,639,"Hi, Lauren 🙂 I’m glad you’re on the boards! It’s great to find encouragement here 🙂 Yes, you’re right, there is a lot of conflicting info out there, but really, there is even more that is consistent across diets. All recommend low carbs, LOTS of veggies, none that I know of suggest gluten grains at all, etc. So, if you really want a diet that is “safest of the safe” you could go with *only* the foods that are approved on the vast majority of diets and leave out any foods that any of the diets call into question. Most of us, though, do some reading and then some more reading, and then just start making calls. I limit my approved grains each day, for instance, but I eat lentils or other beans here and there, I eat kefir twice a day, but I eliminate all soy. I just had to make an educated choice on what to include and what to leave out. Most of us wind up doing that, I think. To answer your question specifically, this particular version of the diet *does* allow a few grains in stage 1 of the diet (but not in the “purge”, detox drink stage, I believe). Even then, though, some of the users on this board do not eat grains of any kind for a while. I couldn’t do this. I’m pregnant, have semi-low blood sugar, and have four children to care for all day everyday. Without the grains, I didn’t have enough energy for my daily life! So, I eat grains – mostly buckwheat and millet in combination, a little brown rice here and there, some amaranth, but not a lot in any one day. Everyone has to make a call based on what they know and what their body seems to need. On the eggs. If you cannot find certified antibiotic-free eggs & meat, I personally would just go vegetarian. The low dose antibiotics in most meats, poultry, eggs, and dairy are a big detriment to the ACD. I use eggs, but I’m able to get them fairly inexpensively from Trader Joe’s and they’re free of additional hormones, antibiotics, and are cage free. Again, it depends on what’s available to you. Hope some of this helps! Sounds like you’re on the right track! 🙂"
2,2ndRound,639,"Since I’m not following the website diet since I just discovered it and this forum tonight, I’ll just offer an opinion and tell you what I did when I did my first cleanse awhile ago, (and my current 2nd). I think I can see how you may want to do the cleanse part first without the herbs to clear your gut up to receive them better, don’t understand the 3 weeks of diet part without the herbs right away. I guess unless you’re really really sick, the initial purge symptoms might be hard to take maybe? But then you could just try taking the herbs at half dosage if its too much at first too… I had gone to an Avureydic therapist’s health assessment at a spa and got diagnosed with Candida. He recommended I START with the Candigone kit – which contained the herbs and supplements, etc. That made a HUGE difference for me, I was bouncing off the walls with energy by the end, but felt sick flu-like body aches the first few days. What you’ve got are antifungals I don’t know specifics on, but look into rotating the peau darco, hemp hearts and grapefruit extract every week or couple of weeks to avoid resistance if you’re taking it more than a few weeks. Meaning take a maybe two at a time, then a different two, etc. I’m not sure what’s in the paragone and the totalpara so I can’t tell you for sure about that. But I can say to take the acilodophus all the way through, since its basically the good bacteria you’re trying to replace the Candida with. I’m not necessarily sure if its something that attacks the Candida at all or if its just something to help restore balance. I’ve been taking some form of probiotic (acidophilus pearls my naturopath’s recommended brand) for over 5 years now, changed my life for the better, will never stop taking it. Also, I really really hate to say it, but vision and weight loss problems can be linked to diabetes too. So maybe try a diabetes test? Regardless Candida overgrowth can also lead to blood sugar problems and the doctor would probably put you on a reduced sugar diet anyway so this diet should help you regardless, and maybe even help prevent if you happen to be in the ‘at risk’ category. I have a friend with the rare privilege  of being type 1 and type 2 so that’s how I know this. Hope this helps, good health!"
3,JustJoe,639,"Make sure the garlic is fresh whole garlic. Garlic compounds, or garlic paste, powder or chunks will do no good. The reason is the chemistry behind it. Once garlic is cut, it begins to loose the compounds that are beneficial to the body, and the longer it remains cut, the more it breaks down. So anything you use with garlic, chop up fresh garlic and use it that way. Try not to heat it either. I’ve actually gotten into the habit every night of taking a clove of garlic and cutting it into small pieces and swallowing it with a little water, thereby keeping the beneficial (yeast-killing) qualities alive."
0,debthebee,640,"I’ve read the symptoms of die off and they are very similar to those of Candida itself. What confuses me is often there is a food that isn’t a definite no so people have said be careful and see how you feel when you eat it e.g. white rice. The diet doesn’t say to completely eliminate it but it suggests brown rice because of the fibre in it. However, how am I supposed to know if I’m having a reaction to this food or say nuts that I haven’t soaked in water? I don’t know how to differentiate. Feeling unwell is supposed to tell you that the diet is working and you are killing off the Candida so it’s very confusing. Any thoughts?"
1,JustJoe,640,"I believe the best way to determine if it is a reaction (bad) vs die-off (good) is that the reaction will happen rather quickly after you eat the food and last a longer whereas die-off should be over relatively quickly, within a few hours. But there is NO good answer, and everyone asks it, including myself."
0,skyblue,641,"Hello, Skyblue here. I have a question about oil of oregano. I started this a little over a week ago, slowly at first, and then I moved the dosage up to 6 drops a day. Saturday I had terrible dye-off symptoms, sick all day long. Yesterday, I felt a lot better, but had diarrhea all afternoon, which I felt was a good sign. However, this morning I have noticed that my Candida symptoms are worse than they’ve been in several days. Does anyone know whether or not I should expect these symptoms to be worse right after a few days of dye-off symptoms? This has really got me stumped; I really expected the symptoms to be better this morning. Thanks for any feedback. Skyblue"
1,kaye,641,"hi skyblue ,  i experienced exactly the same, its because you are taking too much, you need to lower the dose back down . its because oil of oregano is really really strong . stick with it though as im on the mend 😉 . hope this helps. btw drop to two drops in the morning . and very slowly increase , also make sure you drink shit loads of water to pee all the toxins out . kayex"
2,skyblue,641,"Hi, Kayex. Thank you so much for the immediate response. Are you saying that too much oil of oregano can actually cause your symptoms to grow worse? Or were you talking about the dye-off symptoms? If it’s the dye-off symptoms, that makes sense, but for too much oil to cause my symptoms to grow worse – well, I just don’t understand that. Is there a reason for this? Thanks again, SO much. Sky"
3,JustJoe,641,"The die-off symptoms can be more severe when you take too much, but that doesn’t mean your symptoms are getting worse, it basically means you are overloading your body with too much. Essentially what happens when the yeast dies is that it breaks open and releases toxins. And with a large amount of yeast killers, especially in the beginning, you will open up pandora’s box and kill a lot of yeast and thus release their toxins, called mycotoxins, which will cause you to flare up with your set of individual symptoms, making you think you are getting worse. But it is because your body (liver, etc.) cannot handle the overload. So take less and figure out what amount works for you so that you do not get to a point where it is overwhelming. As you go along, you can increase it slowly."
0,absgail,642,i cant find it in our place.. darn i hate it sooo much!! it is the only lacking thing in the diet!! can i proceed even w/o bentonite?
1,Able900,642,"Many Candida sufferers cure their infestation without ever using bentonite. There are other ways of cleansing with an equal potential of doing a good job. Lemonade Master Cleanse Recipe for (1) glass: 2 Tablespoons Fresh Lemon Juice 2 Tablespoons Organic Maple Syrup 1/10 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper Powder – or to taste  8 ounces (250 milliliters) of Pure Water There’s a simpler recipe if the one above bothers you. Simply squeeze one whole lemon in a glass of water, stir and drink it. Doing either of the two at least three times a day will act as a cleanse, especially if you’re leaving other food items alone for at least a few days while you’re performing the cleanse. You should drink plenty of water during any cleanse. Able"
2,NeekyNoo,642,"Able, I really value your opinion, and you are obviously so knowledgable about candida. But I would never have thought that maple syrup is ok, can you explain how it’s acceptable in this cleanse recipe?"
3,Able900,642,"Hello, Neeky, I understand your concern about organic maple syrup. For anyone who believes that the organic MS in the cleanse would harm instead of help, I seriously suggest that they either use the pure lemon cleanse or simply leave the maple syrup out of the original recipe. I say this because there are literally volumes of research and experiments proving that the pictures and ideas we create in the mind and imagination are capable of creating actual situations. The cleanse done before either the diet or antifungals are started is meant to do just what the name implies, “cleanse” the body. It is not intended to kill or even necessarily hinder the Candida. A Candida infestation grows in the body only because the body has become toxic for whatever reason, and our metabolism can eliminate only a small amount of toxins at a time. If the intestines are full of mucus ridden plaque, as with a Candida infestation, then the toxins have literally become stuck in the intestines and the intestines will need to be cleaned before the infestation can be cured. This can be done quickly with a powerful cleanse, or slower with a 100% clean diet. This means having only pure water and pure lemon water daily along with fresh, organic green vegetables and occasionally an organic boiled egg for at least two to four weeks. I don’t blame anyone for not trying the cleanse if they have even the slightest doubt about its efficiency, as I do understand how ridiculous it sounds considering the MS. Everyone who is reading these posts now has a negative possibility for the cleanse in their mind, so again, I advise them to disregard the maple syrup in the recipe and simply leave it out if they try the cleanse. This being said, I would still like to defend my post by saying that there have been experiments showing that Candida patients who used this cleanse did not become worse, and were able to continue their cure as normal afterwards, but these patients were not told the ingredients of the cleanse. Even so, the power of the mind is our most powerful tool, for both good and bad. Anyone who doubts that the mind and imagination are as powerful as I am saying would perhaps benefit from reading about the research and experiments with the placebo effect. In one particular case, 180 patients with knee pain and in need of knee surgery were divided into three different groups. Two of the groups were given treatments which consisted of removing the damaged cartilage in one of two different ways, both requiring surgery. One type of surgery was actually done by surgically removing the damaged cartridge, and the other was irrigation or flushing the damaged cartridge from the tissue of the knee. The third group received what was called “placebo surgery”. This meant that they were put to sleep just the same as the other groups were, but the only ‘surgery’ they received was an incision made on the knee which was then given stitches, but nothing whatsoever was done to any part of the knee cartilage or tissue. The follow-up took two years, and afterwards all 180 patients reported to have various degrees of improvement in their symptoms which included the ability to walk and to use their knee without pain. All three groups were told which surgery they received at the end of the follow-up period. Thank you for bringing this concern to my attention, Neeky, and I appreciate your kind words as well as all of your posts. Able"
4,NeekyNoo,642,"Hi Able, I completely agree with you about the power of the mind, so much so that I have spoken to a hypnotherapist who is going to help me battle my candida. I’ll report back if I notice a dramatic difference, although I’m mostly feeling better every day, so it might just be a subtle help."
0,Lily,643,Ok I’m confused! Been reading about the Candida diet and starting my cleanse today. Most info I have read states no fruit yet one of the recipes for breakfast contains apples. Can I have apples or not??
1,Lily,643,"Ah ok so I can have them in Step 2. Great, was hoping to have them as a snack during detox! Not much you can nibble on is there if you’re hungry between meals?"
2,helmax,643,"Hello, Lily. Personally, I leave all apples out of my diet. The only fruits I have are lemons, limes, and about once or twice a week, half a handful of blueberries. These things are all I can tolerate in the way of fruit. Actually, the granny smith green apple shows up on a lot of Candida diets. All you can do with this information is to give it a try. However, I would not start with a whole apple, perhaps a quarter at the very most, and take it from there according to your reactions to that. Just keep in mind that you’ll find almost as many different Candida diets online as there are people posting them. The bottom line is, every one of us is different from the other, and there should not be a set rule which states, “THIS is the diet to follow for Candida.” Be your own judge; don’t let anyone else do that for you. Good luck to you, Max"
3,Lily,643,Hi Max Thanks for the advice! Yes I’ve noticed during my research of what I should or shouldn’t eat during the initial detox phase that there is a lot of conflicting information out there. I have decided to leave apples alone while I’m detoxing and will introduce them later into the diet and see what happens. This is only my 2nd day but I’ve noticed a difference already! Lily
4,veg2,643,"There definitely ARE a million different anti candida diets. I was so frustrated at first because some contradict each other. I eventually just figured I’d err on the side of caution at least for the first month or so. I also am working with an herbalist so that helps with diet questions. For in between meals/snacks, some things I’ve had are; plain greek yogurt (sweetened with stevia/xylitol/truvia if needed, celery sticks with almond butter, nuts/seeds (pumpkin seeds/almonds/no peanuts!), tons of water, veggies with hummus, veggie soup with avocado."
5,Lily,643,Thanks! Any advice is welcome. Bought some whole almonds today but was still unsure whether I should have them. I know you can soak them in water in case of any mold but how long do you soak them for? Lots of gaps in info! Almond butter seems another controversial item. Some say yes it’s fine others say no. I’ve been having natural yogurt (probiotic) but even that contains the natural sugar lactose. I like to sprinkle it with pumpkin and sunflower seeds. It can all be so confusing with regards to ‘safe’ foods

7,Bettyboo,643,"Hello! I have the meridian almond butter and have that with celery sticks all the time as a snack and so far I think I am ok with it…I hope so as otherwise I have no idea what I will snack on, i can’t have dairy, I tried the sheep yoghurt to try and get some probiotics in but I just couldn’t eat it 🙁 I tried soaking the almonds but the next day I opened the cupboard, took the lid off and they had grown thick gross mould all over them – yuk so that has put me off a tad! The first time I had candida I was told alot of things that I could eat but now there is so much more information available and I can’t see how I have ever actually gotten rid of it when I was eating apples, pears, drinking gin and vodka the whole time! ridic! In stage two should I be trying to get some pro biotics in my diet though? bit concerned my stomach is not getting good stuff back in…"
8,Lily,643,"Hi That’s the same almond butter I use. I spread it on rice cakes but it’s very claggy in your mouth! I also tried soaking almonds but they’ve gone horrible so thrown them away. Tasted a few and they weren’t nice at all. I’ve already started a probiotic supplement, just today and I’ve only done 1 week of detox. Had a G&T last night and I have a small sore red patch on my tongue again (could be the mouldy almonds though!) It’s a pretty hard ‘diet’ to follow but I can see the benefits already. My skin is so much clearer and I’ve lost 7lbs in 7 days!"
9,Bettyboo,643,"Hello! What probiotic are you taking? Ive been recommended the neways one which looks good but didnt think I was meant to start on that until stage three?!? I love the almond butter with celery – odd combo but somehow it works! I’m looking into buckwheat flakes and crackers at mo as they’re a plant not grain! Bizarre, but I couldn’t eat the rice crackers. I’m not really getting any massive die off or clear signs its exiting my system which is weird as I’ve been on candiclear for five days I’ve felt pretty rubbish but no real big die off yet like I had before?! I can’t eat anymore garlic than I’m having don’t know what’s gonna kill it!! Oh RE my finger – I went to walk in centres, Drs, allergy specialists, homeopaths, nutritionists, they’ve all given me lotions and potions but nothing has worked which is why I feel it’s definitely like a symptom my stomach is not right I think it’s linked to that area by meridian points etc bit like reflexology. Maybe I’ll crack on getting the good bacteria in then…oh and yes definitely noticed my skin just looks healthy and lost half a stone! So I’m a bag of bones with garlic breath lol what a catch ha ha!"
10,Lily,643,"I don’t think you’re meant to take antifungals still stage 2 either but the doc had prescribed me them and then I started the detox. I just thought well surely killing them with meds and starving them through detox is gotta be good! I think they don’t suggest doing both at once in case the symptoms of die off are too severe but the first four days were all that affected me. But it could have been just the sugar and caffeine withdrawal anyway. Hard to tell as never been through this before! I’m doing the detox, taking antifungals and probiotics so not following what is said on here to the letter but I don’t see how taking probiotics at any time can be bad? I ordered Healthspans probiotics as I use a lot of their stuff anyway. Wow really hope you sort your finger out! Sounds like a real pain!"
11,Lily,643,“Note that you can actually take probiotics at any time during the Candida Diet.” Just been checking stage 3 and it says the above so looks like you can take your probiotics now. They can only do you good! Hope they help make you feel better 🙂
12,Bettyboo,643,"Woo hoo thank you for that you’ve been really helpful which is appreciated 😀 I’m going to check out the healthspan one, ive got some solgar advanced acidophilus so I may start that in the mean time. The finger has dried up a bit but I’m going to a homeopath to get tested etc weds so will be good to get some support and advice and see where I’m at! Hope all is going well with you! 😀"
13,Bettyboo,643,"Btw Started probiotic I had yesterday (solgar advanced acidophilus) and this morning and I’ve had and still got worse headache and sick feeling ever yuck. Ive ordered the complete probiotic from healthspan, it had good reviews so thought might aswell get on with it! So will start those once they arrive My memory is awful right now too 🙁"
14,helmax,643,"Betty, it sounds like you’re having a couple of die-off symptoms. Have you read the list of symptoms? The things you’ve named are definitely on the list. If you’re not already experiencing die-off, you probably will eventually if you stick with the regimen. Here’s what you can do to help that. Go to a vitamin or health food store and purchase something called Molybdenum, it’s not at all expensive. It’s an essential trace element, and very helpful with clearing the body of toxins which are released by the dead Candida cells (these toxins cause the die-off symptoms). It was a life saver for me when I experienced debilitating, horrible die-off symptoms from too much rutabaga. Good luck to you.  Max"

How do you know when you’re ready to move to the next stage? etc Thank you! Dear maymichellee, Let me start by saying that I can fully appreciate how frustrating this must be for you. I know its hard and that it takes alot of determination and will power to follow this diet. I am also a newbie to this form and I only started the diet about 2 weeks ago. I will tell you what I did so that perhaps you might feel encouraged. First of all my ultimate goal is to get well again, I have been sick for so long that I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. So that is my drive. My alarm bells started ringing loudly when I saw the state of my tongue, completely covered in thrush, that including a myriad of symptoms. (if you read post, titled thank you able you will find lots of valuable information). So i started my diet with a 7 day fast and i followed the diet to a T that is I took the psyllium husk powder as well as the bentonite and the liver flush in the evening. After 7 days, I started to feel better + I lost weight which was not intended. During this time the candida would have already started to die off because I starved It from sugar, caffeine, stuff that feeds candida and causes it to increase and multiply. Then i went to stage 1 of the diet making sure that I do not eat anything that might have sugar in it, i.e absolutely no fruits, no fizzy drinks, no alcohol, no bread that has yeast, no pasta, no grains, no apple pies or anything similar. Also no complex carb vegetables e.g potatoes and carrots because during digestion they turn into sugar. We dont want to feed the candida do we? Check list of foods to eat on this site, you will get a very good idea. I am sure you are saying to yourself, na ffit I cannot do this, however dont panic, there are several items that you can eat and quite delicious to. I must admit that during the cleanse i got extremely hungry so I ate almonds which are an antifungal, as well organic goat yogurt because it is a probiotic. I ate them once a day, its a question of trial and error, you try and see how your body reacts. I am still in the experimental stage of stage 1, pretty much trying out a bit of this and a bit of this.  You can bake your own bread with coconut flour, by the way coconut oil is also an antifungal. There is a recipe with the coconut bread posted by Able900 its very good and easy to do. One recommendation, during the cleanse make sure to either drink distilled or filtered water to avoid drinking any unnecessary chemicals. Plus try to buy organic food and meats, remember that everything non organic is full of chemicals, pesticides, hormones and alot of bad stuff. Please also stay away from the diaries milk, cheese etc. I say again dont panic this is stage 1 of the diet in stage 2 you can start to reintroduce foods again. On this site it says that you can stay on stage 1 of the diet for about 3 weeks if I’m not mistaken, however it is safer to stay on stage 1 until you have no symptoms whatsoever and to keep to the diet for a month longer then move to stage 2. This is just to make sure you eliminate any possibility of a relapse.  Another word of caution, antifungals are good because they cause die off, however you want to go slow on die off because it causes very unpleasant things in your body, you can feel sicker than you do with candida. Once again there is a list on this site with anticandida foods. Take a look. Also please do read posts titled thank you Able, its full of information. Also another post by me, cant remember the title but it ends something like only 1 reply something like that anyway. One last thing, ask yourself, how badly do you want to get well? How badly do you want to stop having back to back yeast infections? Are you tired of being unwell? How long will you keep giving in to your cravings, which after all is your candida being fed, only to pay for it the next day? The way I see it is I want to get well and I will not pay the price of feeling sick by giving in to my cravings. Indeed life is short and i would much rather die later than sooner!"
2,maymichellee,644,"There is just so much info, and it’s all rather conflicting&confusing! I guess this is going to full of a lot of trial and error. Does it have to be organic meat? It’s a bit expensive, at least what I have seen is. Also, where in the world do I find yogurt that has no sugar?? I have checked Lowe’s Food and Walmart – nothing. I have read that the brand “La Yogurt” is unsweetened, but I haven’t found it. Is there a certain store I should go to? What brands do I need to look for? I know I need to go to Whole Foods, but it’s a hour away. I’m trying to find things as close as possible to me. You would think the idea of being pain free, healthier, and happier would be appealing enough, but I am so use to feeling yucky, I just deal with it! I need to work on changing my way of thinking and viewing this!"

I know I need to go to Whole Foods, but it’s a hour away. I’m trying to find things as close as possible to me. You would think the idea of being pain free, healthier, and happier would be appealing enough, but I am so use to feeling yucky, I just deal with it! I need to work on changing my way of thinking and viewing this! Preferably yes, non organic meat is pumped with all sorts of antibiotics, hormones and other chemicals that are not good for anyone let alone candida sufferers! Yes i know its more expensive but its healthier, tastier and what price do you put on your health? I read in another post that there is a shop called Trader Joe who carries most of the stuff I spoke about as well as kefir which is a liquid form of yogurt filled with probiotics, very good for you. It also carries unsweetened natural yogurt. Look for a local organic shop. I dont live in the U.S.A so my knowledge of shops is 0. Yes there is much info and it is conflicting and confusing however there are many experienced people on this site who offer a world of valuable info. Did you read the correspondence between Able and myself, if not please do read it. Its full of info, not the conflicting kind. It would be ideal if youo could find a shop closer to you but then again if you plan wisely you can save yourself alot of time and energy. Once again and this might sound harsh, stop moaning and groaning if you want to get well you have to set your mind to it and do something about it. It definitely is not going to happen on its own. I too was used to feeling yucky for a very long time but I got fed up! It seems like you have not had enough of feeling yucky as yet"
4,maymichellee,644,"Hm. I’m not sure about the organic meat. I’m stretching my money as it is, plus I’m trying to save (getting married next year!). I have always had issues with my stomach, for as long as I can remember. I have always had problems going to the bathroom. I wake up feeling bloated. I always feel nauseous after eating. Some days are worse than others. I have heard of Trader Joe’s, but again it’s a hour away (I live in a very small town, which is mainly full of “mom&pop” shops. Also, I don’t drive, which makes it more difficult. I do want to commit to this diet. I feel it would be very stupid of me to ignore all of this information and continue eating as normal."

This is the type of yogurt to look for. Be sure to start out eating yogurt or anything else that’s new very, very slowly as it may cause Candida reactions in the beginning. Two teaspoons is satisfactory as a test the first day you eat it. If you receive a Candida reaction to it, you could wait another week and then try it again. If you are able to tolerate it, after two days having two teaspoons full, you could raise the amount to three teaspoons and continue to raise it daily from there. As far as organic meats are concerned, yes, they are more expensive, but the reason that we suggest it is because non-organic meats as well as chicken contain antibiotics and hormones which are not good for even a healthy person but especially someone with Candida. There is also a difference in what the animals are fed. Many people cannot afford to purchase organic meats all the time; in this case, choosing organic eggs is a good and less costly substitute.

Cut out all yeast products, fruit & dairy first, then grains and the starchy veg when you’re ready. Read up on foods you CAN eat rather than can’t, it’s much better for you psychologically. Have you looked into what foods you can buy online? Can you get an organic meat and/or veg box delivered? Buying a whole chicken and taking the meat off the bone is a more economical way of buying it (there’ll be videos on line if you want to learn how to do it)  Do you eat fish? I’ve been trying some cheaper fish that’s available and some of it’s really nice. I hope that when you start to feel the benefits, that will be enough to encourage you to commit to it fully, it really will be worth the effort."

I will test it out the way you have said to. I use to eat Activia every morning and never seemed to have an issue with it. As for the meat, I have been trying to give up red meat for some time. I had tried being a pescatarian, maybe I’ll do that again. For fish, I know there is the issue of mercury and such, do I need to worry about that if it is organic? I had already added organic eggs to my list 🙂 I’m not much for eggs (had a bad episode with some rotten ones!), but I’m sure I’ll come around. I’ll take your word on the ‘horrific health problems’! Thank you for your helpful information!!"

I don’t know why I haven’t tried just removing one thing at a time! I have done fairly well with removing bread from my diet, but that’s about the only thing. The hardest things for me are pastas and fast food. Terrible, I know! My mom and my fiance have given me the same advice as you. It seems all my life I have focused on the negative side of things. I’m really trying to change that. I will look into having foods delivered, though I’m not sure how I feel about that. Plus, it will probably be near impossible. As I said in a previous post, I live in a very small town – a lot of people don’t even know it exists! The day after I have actually avoided all the bad stuff, I did feel rather better. Did you/are you doing the cleanse before starting stage one? I attempted, but I just can’t handle the liver flush drink – any suggestions? Would it be okay just to do one of those colon cleanse kits? Thank you for posting! 🙂 And, I hope your journey becomes easier!"
10,Diane,644,"Dear Maymichelle, This diet is not easy and I can understand that its hard to give up so many things at one go. I like the idea of cutting of stuff one thing at a time then all at once, I think it may make your life much easier. I was so ill that I just had to stop everything at once  but thats just me. So Neekynoo was and is very sensible in her/his advice, take it nice and slow and when you feel ready for it, it wont be so hard. Remember, there are people here who are ready to help so just reach out and we will answer your questions. Last time I was rough and I apologise about that, I guess, sometimes I cannot understand why we take so long to realise that feeling sick should not be an option to live by. Thats all for now Good luck be healthy Diane"

Would it be okay just to do one of those colon cleanse kits? I did my version of the cleanse, taken from a mix of my research.  For a week I had a fresh veg juice for breakfast, raw soup for lunch and then dinner was a raw salad (for the first few nights I had one of fish, millet or quinoa with this) and nuts as snacks. After a week I did a juice fast (2 ltr fresh veg juice throughout the day) The following day I did a water fast (this was a tough day, I did nothing all day!) The following day I had just juice again. I then went back on juice, soup and salad, adding fish, meat and some grains back in. Working into it slowly meant it was so much easier to stick to, and I only started to feel REALLY hungry when I was reintroducing more foods, it was then very difficult to control myself! I did the liver flush a couple of times, but really couldn’t take it either. I did an enema every day of the fasts and then a few days after, this made me feel better about not having the flush. I am now having (every morning for the last week) chopped garlic, a whole lemon juiced, ginger juice (grate & squeeze out the juice), 3 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp bentonite clay, 1 tsp psyllium husks. All the ingredients ar supposed to be really good for detoxing your liver, and the concoction is much more palatable. I’m ‘happy’ to have this for another few weeks. I hope this helps 🙂"
12,Able900,644,"maymichellee; About the organic yogurt, the sugar content will still be listed; however, it isn’t necessary for the grams to be over two digits. For example, Oikos brand contains 9 grams per serving. I believe that Activia contains much more than that, so I would leave it alone. If you wish to find a good source for fish, take a look at Vital-Choice’s website. This is where I purchase all of the fish I eat. The fish they market are free of hazardous levels of mercury. This is because they only market species that are known to be inherently low in mercury content. The other thing to think about is eating younger fish which have less of a chance of having any mercury content at all, such as herring and sardines. http://vitalchoice.com/shop/pc/home.asp If you’re going to try and eat more eggs and like egg salad, let me know and I’ll post a recipe for you that’s healthier and Candida friendly.

Anyway, not all stevia is created equal taste-wise. I like the KAL because it doesn’t have that bizzaro grassy aftertaste that some stevias have. A stevia tip: a little goes a LONG way, and using slightly too little is FAR better than using slightly too much. If you use too much stevia in something it just tastes plain weird. Hope it helps!"

6,kryssy,645,"Like everyone else in Europe I have had to import my Stevia illegally but now France has lifted the ban and it is readily available here. As Stevia was discovered and developed here in the 1930’s I’m at a loss to understand why France let it be banned in the first place. I digress …. I have bought some plants by post from a company in Nantes and they are doing wonderfully well on my sunny porch, although they will not survive the winter without some t.l.c. From now on I’ll be making my own leaf Stevia as opposed to the refined stuff which can leave a bitter taste. I know everyone in UK (and Europe) still has difficulty buying Stevia and I’m sure the UK will eventually jump out of the pockets of the fat cat sugar corporations and lift the ban, but in the meantime perhaps a day trip to France wouldn’t be a bad idea for some Stevia shopping. I have asked the company who stocks the plants if they would send to UK and will let you know what they say and if it is yes, then I will post their link here, if I am able to. I am sure the plants are sold all over the country and even at the markets and with so many ex-pats here now I’m sure a lot of you know someone who know’s someone who has moved here and could help you out. I would even do that myself for anyone who would like me to. I just thought this little bit of info might be of benefit to the Forum. Kryssy"
7,kryssy,645,"Update: The company I bought my plants from will deliver to the following countries. France (10 euros) Germany – Belgium – Netherlands – Luxemburg (15 euros) UK – Italy – Spain (18 euros) Austria – Denmark – Ireland – Portugal (22 euros) Finland – Norway – Sweden – Switzerland (25 euros) I know this postal cost seems high but if you work out how much you pay for powder or liquid Stevia compared to growing your own plants and harvesting the leaves, then added to the cost of the plants (which is reasonable) it can save money in the end. The plants are well established and very healthy and well packaged. I got a free Bottle Brush plant as a gift which was nice. Link here  if interested. I do not have shares or anything else in this company by the way."
8,Able900,645,"I didn’t care for Stevia, even the pure extract, the after-taste wasn’t that bad, and I probably could have lived with that, but each time I tried it I felt that I experienced a mild but weird Candida-like-reaction from it. So I switched to Truvia and didn’t experience the after-taste or the weird reaction, and use it now every morning in chicory coffee. Truvia is a Stevia-based product, and I realize that considering this, all of this makes no sense, but I don’t argue with what my body tells me.  By the way, I also received a less-mild reaction when I tried Xyiotol, call me weird, it’s not like it’ll be the first time. =)"

0,purple212,646,"I read an answer in the general description about someone on the cleanse having to take antibiotics. It’s Colloidal Silver. Kills over 650 viruses and bacteria, including CANDIDA. It’s relatively inexpensive and you can also make it yourself. Antibiotics kill your immune system and mask the problem. That’s why it keeps recurring, but perhaps, seems different than the first set of symptoms because it changes the strain."
1,Able900,646,"Before any of us ingest a chemical element which is known as a ‘precious metal’ and normally used for making jewelry, tableware, silverware and coins, maybe just a little research into the metal would be a good idea. What happens in the body when it’s given a silver compound? “A silver compound will typically become silver chloride as soon as it hits the stomach. The silver chloride is sparingly soluble, about .8 ppm. The dissolved silver chloride will move into the blood stream and once there will be exposed to chemicals that will induce the silver to plate out on any other silver particles present. However initially there will be no other silver particles present, so the silver chloride circulates in the blood until exposed to light in the skin, where they are photo reduced to silver atoms. This is the photographic process that occurs when you take a picture (with a film camera). Once the silver atoms are produced in the skin, then the rest of the silver chloride will begin reducing onto those particles making them grow very fast, and resulting in many of them getting stuck in the skin. Since the particles are so small, they will appear as black or blue, giving the skin a bluish cast. This is called argyria, and can result from taking silver compounds without any colloidal component.” Mayo Clinic Report on Colloidal Silver http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/colloidal-silver/AN01682 Colloidal Silver: Miracle Elixir or Plague … http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1820 Research, Side Effects and Risks http://www.raysahelian.com/colloidalsilver.html Facts: Probiotics: Scientific studies show that probiotics are beneficial in preventing infections and illnesses and promoting good health in general, as well as strengthening the body’s immune response. A strong immune system can greatly reduce the occurrence of disease and infection. Oil of Oregano: Oil of Oregano is a natural antibacterial with antiseptic action and is listed in medical literature and as having the ability of fighting biological toxins. It’s a potent natural antibiotic, in fact, more powerful than a lot of prescription antibiotics. Honey combined with Cinnamon: The daily use of cinnamon and honey in combination will build up and give power to the immune system strengthening the white blood cells which in turn protects the body from bacteria and viruses. Garlic: Garlic was long ago proven to be a treatment against bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections. This is due to its active compound called allicin, which is very similar to penicillin. Garlic has the ability of fighting both staph and strep infections and other germs that are resistant to traditional antibiotics, and covers a broad spectrum of bacteria. Echinacea: Echinacea works very similar to garlic, meaning it fights bacteria, fungi and various viruses. It also stimulates our immune system by increasing production of the cells that attack infection."

There’s a place for them, possibly even when one is battling candida. You just can’t mess around with some infections."
0,whyitsme,647,"I knew that birth control was a big cause of candida, but I skirted around going off it until recently, since after 25 years was nervous about the not knowing how my body would react. All I can say is wow, I wish I did it earlier. I have only been off for 2 weeks, and I noticed a big change already. Granted after being on diet for 5 months now, the diet was working itself and I had been starting to feel better. But last week I felt my body do a major allergen purge through my eyes and tear ducts for over 5 days, so my body felt relieved that something was gone. Makes me wonder if perhaps it started with an allergic reaction to pill, then pill causing the candida growth which in turn produced major food allergies. I went to naturopath today and got retested on few of the major foods I still had issues with before I started 5 months ago, and yeast, gluten and soy were now all fine. (which is very good news)Only sugar and vinegar are main issues which I’ll just go back and get desensitized to them. so things are looking up. So after rambling, my point was if you are female on pill, stop taking it, it may be the major change required to get you back to health. But don’t forget safe sex :)I was recommended to try murina iud instead. I also started taking digestive enzymes with protein, since my body had trouble with it by itself. That also may have been a source of cause. But you can’t get better unless you fix the cause(s) as well."
1,whyitsme,647,"Okay now that was the biggest mistake! I went back on birth control pill yesterday. last 3 months have been awful, I would rather spend my life on thecandida diet, then half of it in pain due to terrible cramping. I also cheated alot over last couple months. My will power went down the drain. Hoepfully body wil bounce back to the way it was before going off it quickly."
2,NeekyNoo,647,"Hiya, You may find that when your Candida has gone, or is at least under control, that you have pain free periods.

I hope you manage to sort yourself out."
3,Fillie,647,"OK I am confused now! I’ve read what people say in this page and I see ‘5 month on the diet’ and more than ‘2 months on the second stage’, if I got that right. So I have a question: How long does this diet take? I mean it says that first stage takes 3 weeks, but people talk about 4 weeks or more. So can anyone help me understand about how long we are talking about overall and what it depends on?? And also…is there anyone in this forum that has completed this diet and never got candida symptoms again? Any light in the tunel? Thanks"
4,Katy Gillett,647,"@whyitsme – do you know if the patch (I’m on it instead of the pill because my body couldn’t tolerate the pill) has the same affects on candida as the pill? I was getting painful cramps and cysts which occasionally and very painfully ruptured so my gynecologist put me on the patch and everything got much better. But now I’m on this diet I’m wondering if the patch will hinder my progress. Any ideas? @Fillie – from what I can gather about the time period of the diet, it very much depends on the extent of your candida problem. I think it is all about listening to your body and deciding for yourself when it is right to move on to the next stage. Or of course you can hire a naturopath/herbalist/nutritionist to decide these things for you if its possible."
5,Cairo,647,"I’ve been doing regular acupuncture – twice a week since i started my Candida program. I am being treated for a “damp liver” of which the Candida is a symptom. (I’m not at all qualified to say that this is true for everyone with Candida) But I too had some rather unbearable cramps* before going on the diet/seeing-an-acupuncture and the regular visits have been a real boon to my cramps, constipation and a wonderful help, I think, while treating Candida. The acupuncturists also have administered some tinctures and herbs that have helped and my skin is looking better than it has in years! While I know that acupuncture alone would not be able to stop the candida overgrowth (I agree with everyone who says- you can’t do it without going on the diet- and being strict), it may really help your cramps. They will look under your tongue to know if you have painful cramping so they can monitor this while you are still on the pill, and maybe you can go off the pill again. I have been going to acupuncture twice a week, (I began a version of the diet 5 months ago) although now I feel well enough to limit it to once a week. This can be quite expensive– except if you are familiar with http://www.communityacupuncturenetwork.org/ There is a location right in Seattle http://www.communichi.org/ (which does not surprise me) This has been a real life-saver for me. good luck. * by unbearable I mean: doubled-over, unable to stand, tunnel vision, the most intense pain I’ve ever felt."
6,Ula,647,"I’ve been having bad cramps and unbearable pms for years to the point that I would have to take days off from work. I used acupuncture as well as some herbal remedies and it was definitely helpful but didn’t remove the symptoms completely. A couple of months ago I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and prescribed medication. Since then my symptoms are completely gone! No pms and no cramps. This is not to advocate medications but to show that there may be reasons related to candida that cause cramping (since hypothyroidism is related to candida). Since candida is known to disrupt the hormonal system, I think it is important to monitor it and medicate if necessary. Then again, the medication should be only a temporary relief and the effort to remove the cause has to be made."
7,whyitsme,647,"Before the pill and before the candida I had bad periods. I wouid get cramps at about 3 weeks, then not have period for 4-7 weeks. (This last time being 9 weeks.) I read that once you go off the pill you go back to the periods you had before, so I don’t think the cramps and lack of period have anything to do with the candida since I have had bad ones sicne I started having periods as a kid. I figure I had the diet under control and felt fine when was on pill before. Think body still stabilizing after going back on it, since haven’t been able to get my will power back 100% yet, but all the other symptoms are better. katy: Not sure about reactions to patch. I do know my naturopath says the oral pills are the worst for anybody not just person with candida. Fillie: From what I can tell changes need to be made for the long haul. I did well when was at 98-99% of the diet (after being 100% for 8 weeks). However lately I have been at about 95% with more cheating and it has come back. So figure this is a lifetime of changes. You learn what cheating you can get away with, and what ones you find are more worth it. Like ice cream is way more worth it than a cookie. The key is if cheat then only cheat once and be good on everythign else. it’s when cheating is folowed by more cheating that your body can’t handle. It’s been 1-1/2 years sicne i figured out problem, and still working on getting it right."
0,2ndRound,648,"Hi there, As my name implies, I’m on my 2nd ‘full’ cleanse of Candida (diet & herbal kit) and am looking into keeping up the longevity of my health as I’m sure all of you are. And yes I had EXCELLENT results the first time round, this second round is due to taking a robust course of antibiotics to get rid of some bad pneumonia. I’ve heard about L-Glutamine (or just Glutamine) and how great a supplement it is and am wondering if any of you have any experience introducing it into your personal Candida health plan? When have you introduced it? What stage is it OK to take it at? What were your results?  I’m interested in it because not only is it said to be good against Candida (according to the Planet organic store herbalist people and this wonderful whole foods article Katy Gillett(hope I spelled that right Katy!) posted for me, but because of a personal story too. This runs in my family, and one of my aunts didn’t know about it until she had an operation to remove part of her large intestine. Apparently after the operation happened, one of the comments by the nurse was “Oh look at that (the removed bowel) you must be allergic to yeast!” So there was obvious damage to the bowel. The whole family started to cut down and then eliminate bread after our aunt told us this. I made subsequent visits to an ayurvedic therapist who then introduced and confirmed a Candida diagnosis for me. I don’t know where I learned it from – though probably a fuzzy source on the internet – but another source showed me that a lot of damage from Candida could occur to the intestinal tract especially at the top where the bile comes into play and this made sense to me, because I had gotten to a point before reading this where I was having repeated sharp pains at the top of my intestinal tract (the doctor told me it was there after an examination) then I finally started my first cleanse and all that went away in the course of treatment. The doctor was not helping he just told me ‘oh they’re just pains, don’t worry about them.’ (F*** that! I finally started my 1st cleanse after the visit.) So, my goal is to REPAIR the damage, after being on my cleanse. I’ve been on a different but similar program (Candigone kit) to this website’s, but I am going to incorporate some of it. Since your intestinal tract is not like your liver, it needs help to get better, so I’m seriously looking into Glutamine. I already have some in powdered form. Any history of using Glutamine? Any ideas?"

1,guedez16,649,"herbs are just herbs, is like saying you’re eating too much lettuce…you’ll be fine but you might feel a greater “detox” symptom at first since you have so many herbs fighting candida….and i also heard that candida can become resistant to some herbs? so you might want to alternate them weekly….but i believe that’s bullcrap : )"
2,2ndRound,649,"I’m in the opposite camp saying DO rotate them every 2 weeks or so and DO take a few different ones at a time of the medicines. (some website I was on say 4 at a time, but the Candigone kit I’m using basically hits me with 16!) I say this emphatically because I just watched some awesome Biology class videos on http://www.KhanAcademy.org that explained how resistance occurs. “Introduction to Evolution and natural selection” its the first video in the course, though more details below are in later videos. Basically the situation is that if you take something say, Caprylic Acid, all the time it tends to kill those candida that are more disposed to being killed by it. Just like you know that really annoying old guy who has perfect health just because they are them, so is there also their biotic counterpart in the society of Candida that the Caprylic Acid just won’t put down. That naturally leaves all of those biota that are LESS disposed to being killed by Caprylic Acid, stay around longer and have a multiplying party, thus, Caprylic Acid becomes less and less effective because the other guys who happen to be more resistant are hanging around and multiplying more. So, that’s why you should switch it up. Its also why we are becoming more resistant to antibiotics in the world too. Because a certain strain/specific biota that happened to not be affected by the antibiotic just happened to have the opportunity to multiply more. Also re: the multivitamin and fish oil: when my Naturopath had me go on a cleanse diet she made sure I kept up with the multivitamin, an omega 3 capsule, and the acidophilus pearls probiotic. The multivitamins because when your gut is inflamed/out of control/etc your intestinal tract isn’t absorbing nutrients as well, so more nutrients is better, especially on a controlled diet. The Omega 3 to help lubricate the colon – so should also help the detox and avoid constipation. Not sure if cod liver oil would be a similar thing or not, but I’ve read good things about that brand and I haven’t had any trouble with mine on my diet, though I haven’t been taking it as often as I could. She had me take the pearls specifically because it had a patented coating that allowed the probiotic to actually get into the gut better. I’ve had my friends start on that one and after a few days of gassy discomfort they feel leagues better. But you have to keep taking it. It travels well too, doesn’t need refrigeration."

In addition, the possibility of Candida becoming immune to certain antifungal herbs is not bull rap. Candida has the ability to change itself in order to become resistant to some antifungals, especially when they’re taken for extended periods of time. However, I’m not sold on the idea that rotating different kinds will work. I’ve not seen proof of this actually working, but if anyone has had an experience with this and has actually cured their Candida by doing that, I’d love to hear about it. According to the Herb Encyclopedia – “Many herbs can be harmful in large or prolonged dosages.” Taking large or frequent doses of herbs can cause immunity to the herb. Some people have allergic reactions to herbs, so any new herb should be taken very slowly and in low doses starting out. Also, many herbs can have a serious adverse reaction if mixed with certain prescription drugs. How many people do you suppose use aloe vera for the first time without the knowledge that if they’re allergic to garlic or onions, they’re also likely to have reactions to aloe vera, even if used topically? Or if taken on a long term basis, aloe vera depletes potassium from our system? I shouldn’t have to say that this can be very dangerous. And how many people taking GSE know that the USDA as well as researchers in Germany have conducted grapefruit seed extract studies and discovered that some GSE brands contained something called ‘benzethonium chloride’ as a preservative. This is a man-made chemical compound that’s normally found in cosmetics. According to the material safety data sheet for this chemical, it may affect genetic material and, based on animal test data, it can cause cancer, or at the very least damage the mucous membranes. Just as importantly, in research tests, GSE was shown to reduce the Lactobacilli in humans, to both significant and mild degrees."
0,rajv23,650,"Hi all, I’ve looked through this website & it by far gives the most informative advice. I started the diet a few days ago, and due to being a veggie I’m finding it VERY restrictive. What I wanted to know was: Is there any harm in me taking anti fungals & probiotics in Stage 1? The only reason i can see against it is that it will make the die off symptoms much worse, but i’d much rather suffer severe die off symptoms for a week and be able to reintroduce things like beans & berries after 4 weeks, rather than wait 6/7 weeks. Any opinions? Thanks, Raj"
1,NeekyNoo,650,"As far ad I see it, you are the best judge of what is best for you, by listening to your body and understanding how it’s reacting to what you’re doing. Some of the potential die off symptoms will be harder to cope with than others, so see how you get on."
2,Able900,650,"Greetings Rjv23. Welcome to the forum. Of course you’ll end up making your own decision about the fungals & probiotics. Personally, I didn’t do that right away, especially not just four days into the diet, even though I was aware that I could if I chose to, after all, who was going to stop me? But nevertheless, I decided against it, and I waited a few weeks. And once I experienced that first die-off day, I was very grateful for whatever it was that made me make that particular decision. That was one long, miserable day and one which I’ll never forget. So if you do decide to go ahead and do this, please invest just a small amount of money in two products first. Both of these should be easy to find at just about any vitamin or health food store. The first one goes by the name of Candidate by Native Remedies and another great one is called Molybdenum. Both of these work to greatly lesson the terrible effects of die-off. Candidate helps with the brain fog as well as the sick flu-like-feelings, and Molybdenum helps with detoxing your body from the toxins that are released during die-off. When Candida die they release extremely potent toxins which are called aldehydes. The aldehydes do not belong in your body and are in fact toxic to the human body. They enter your liver and can cause great stress to that organ, and of course they make you sick in the process. Molybdenum is excellent at aldehyde toxin removal, so please consider purchasing both of these items and start using them at least two or three days before you start the probiotics and antifungals. Keep in mind that, if the die-off is severe enough, patients have been known to pass out from the release of toxins. Good luck, Able"
3,rajv23,650,"Hi NeekyNo & Able, many thanks for your replies. I actually created the same topic in a different section of this forum which is why I’ve not looked at this one for a while. I’m almost at the end of week 2 of the diet and I went through a pretty heavy die off about 5 days into the diet. To be honest, I can’t see any difference in my symptoms. Due to the complete lack of energy i have I’m going to include beans/pulses (lentils), porridge and berries to my diet from week 3. This should mean I have a semi normal diet, I can’t really go on without these for much longer. (I’m a veggie as well, so no meat allowed) In terms of natural anti-fungals, I’ve been taking Virgin Coconut Oil & Garlic tablets every day. Able; I’m a bit suspicious about taking other non-natural medication to help kill the candida overgrowth. As i’m hopefully over the worst of it I think I’ll be OK sticking to the two I’m already taking. Thanks for your advice though. I actually think that from next week when I reintroduce beans, pulses & oats I may actually stick with it for 3 months as it’s a very ‘clean diet’ & gives me sufficient protein/carbs."
4,Able900,650,"Hello, rajv. I don’t take prescription drugs either, I use only natural products. Just so you know and for future reference, the Molybdenum is one of the essential minerals which the human body needs and is found in trace amounts in vegetables that grow above ground. It’s just that when the human body is going through the stress of a Candida infestation and so many toxins are being released by Candida die-off, extra amounts of nearly all nutrients are needed. As far as the Candidate is concerned, this is also a natural product. It contains pau d’arco, which is an herb, marigold, and lemon grass. Some of your lack of energy can still be coming from milder die-off symptoms. Extreme hunger which can’t seem to be satisfied, yet having no appetite, is also a sign of die-off as well as the Candida itself. You said you didn’t see any difference in your symptoms after the die-off. This is perfectly normal for most. All that means is that you still have a lot of Candida in your system to rid your body of. I also hope you’re over the worst part of the die-off, but I expect you will experience it again – but hopefully milder. This is especially true if you continue the coconut oil and garlic or add another antifungal. Good luck. Able"

I just know that a friend of mine is following a diet under the supervision of a healthcare professional, and all oats are completely out for the first stage. Right now I’m making a brown rice pudding for tomorrow morning’s breakfast – and I’ll probably munch on a little before bed, too. Cook the brown rice completely. Add in plain, canned coconut milk (if your diet allows it) and stir. Then beat 1-2 eggs well in a separate bowl and then whisk them into the hot rice mixture, making sure to completely incorporate them quickly to keep them from cooking in clumps. Heat the rice mixture to a low boil/bubble for 3-5 minutes to cook the egg through. Remove from heat. Add alcohol-free vanilla, stevia, cinnamon, and nutmeg to taste. And maybe a dash of salt to make the flavor a little fuller. I hope that helps a bit until the oats can get added back in!"

0,carrotflowers,665,"Hi there! I just wanted to post a quick food tip! When I’m short on time, but bored of plain vegetables/grains, I sprinkle some garlic powder, and squeeze some lemon over my food, and voila! A whole new flavor! It definitely makes all this bland food more exciting. I just had it last night with steamed carrots, green beans and quinoa. Also, I’ve been using “everyday seasoning” from Trader Joe’s. It has sea salt, pepper, coriander, mustard seed, etc. and makes it super easy to spice things up. Anyone else have any?"
1,SamanthaB,665,"Yeah garlic and lemon is a favourite of mine as well. You can also add some paprika, cumin, etc for a more fajita style flavour. Also, great snack, have you tried home made popcorn? Literally heat up popping corn in a pan with a lid with a bit of oil and then season with salt and pepper when done 🙂"
2,Hope,665,"I didn’t think corn was allowed in Stage 1. I went back and checked and it’s not on the list of approved foods, but it’s also not on the list of foods to avoid. It’s gluten-free, but it also has a high glycemic index. So, I guess it could go either way (?). I’m doing a combo of this diet and one from a book, and corn is not allowed in the book version. On the seasoning – I do a lot of Asian-inspired sauteeing with sesame oil, garlic, ginger, onion, and salt. Sometimes adding in sesame seeds, too. If you’re using soy, Bragg’s Amino is approved and is awesome in a combo with the flavors I’ve already mentioned. I eat buckwheat grits with a little organic butter, garlic butter, salt, and chili powder. Very tasty 🙂"
3,Hope,665,oops! I meant “garlic SALT” ^^^ not garlic butter 🙂

I’m hoping I can find them online, because I’m fairly certain I won’t find them in my area. The only thing I know I would miss would be the buttery taste. I’m not eating dairy period, and even organic butter is a dairy product, isn’t it? About the corn, I completely agree with you, corn is a starch, pure and simple; I wouldn’t touch it with a 20 foot pole. Thanks, Max"
5,Hope,665,"Sure, Max 🙂 Here’s a link –Pocono Cream of Buckwheat Gotta love good ol’ Amazon 🙂 On the organic butter – lots of people who have fairly significant dairy allergies can still tolerate cow’s milk butter. I don’t use a ton of it. I use extra virgin olive oil and EV coconut oil more than any other fats, *but* sometimes that little pat of butter matters 😉 This buckwheat cereal is one of the foods I choose to splurge and add butter to. I called it “grits” before because I eat it savory and it reminds me a little of regular grits (which I ***love*** with butter and cheese, but oh well!). The buckwheat grits are also good just spiced up with garlic and cayenne. I checked again on the corn. It’s not mentioned in the lists themselves, but I did notice later that it *is* mentioned in the column beside the “foods to eat” and it includes corn along w/ other starchy vegetables that are to be avoided in Stage 1. I’m staying away from all corn ingredients, even the hidden ones like maltodextrin and preservatives for now. Although, now that I’m typing this, my alcohol-free vanilla is in a vegetable glycerin base, and I’ll bet that has corn in it. Man. Corn allergies have got to be one of the worst to work around! Anyway, hope you like the buckwheat stuff! 🙂"
0,Codyssey,666,I heard about hot baths being great for releasing candida toxins in the skin. So I went for it and loved it. Throw some epsom salts in for added effect. I even heard you can add baking soda to help keep toxins from reentering your pores but haven’t tried it. The best part to me though is the refreshing cold shower you take afterward. It is so so invigorating.
1,Morab,666,"I have done the hot bath with Bicarbonate of Soda and Sea Salt, and found it very effective in relieving the pain of onset of bladder infections caused by Candida Albicans. I’ve tried baths with Lavender oil, which is proported to be usefull, but found this highly irritating, even at just 2 drops for the full bath.  I must say I haven’t followed that up with the cold shower, but must give it a try!"
2,Hope,666,The quick transition from hot to cold is very popular in northern European countries. Friends of ours lived in Finland for 6 months last winter and wound up loving the local ritual of first sitting in a purifying sauna and then plunging into the icy water outdoors! The Fins swear by it for overall health & well-being.
0,debthebee,667,Hi I’m new here and have suspected I have Candida for many years but tests and medications haven’t helped. I probably didn’t fully understand the condition before and I’ve never been able to strict so many foods or alcohol from a diet either. I’ve recently decided to try Threelac as well as cutting out foods that make the Candida worse but it’s going to be hard. I was planning a visit to Pizza Hut next week with the family and I was wondering what effect one day of eating not so good foods would have. I would really appreciate any advice. I have a lot of difficulty losing weight so I’ve pretty much been on diets non stop and now starting another new one as restrictive as this is making me feel pretty down in the dumps. Any advice will be much appreciated!
1,sarah,667,"Taking a day off can set you back pretty considerably – if you give the candida that’s still alive in your body a great big feast of foods they love, it will take that much longer to kill them all off. If you routinely take days off, you may not be able kill them all off. Personally, I decided just after Thanksgiving that I wanted to pursue the candida diet. And I chose to wait until after the holidays were over to start, rather than take a start-and-stop approach (or miss out on fudge at Christmas). For me, the extra time allowed me to research candida further, plan the foods I wanted to eat on the diet, and live with my miserable symptoms a while longer (which greatly strengthened my resolve heading in to this). I definitely sympathize with struggles over weight. I’ve done some very strict, harsh, harmful diets in the past and I’ve spent most of my adult life obsessing about my weight. I knew that I didn’t want to lose focus on my health this time. I wanted to be able to pay attention to whether or not my symptoms were improving, and not just obsess about whether the scale was moving. And I didn’t want any possible discouragement at the bathroom scale to lead me to give up, when my health might actually be improving. So… a month before starting the candida diet, I threw out my scale. For the first time in a decade, I don’t know what I weigh. I suspect that I have lost weight – my face and waist both appear to have slimmed. But I don’t know how much and I’m trying not to focus on that, and instead to pay attention to my symptoms. For me, this has been a really positive, healthy decision. It’s not about reaching an arbitrary weight goal; it’s about improving my health and healing my body. I have found it really peaceful not to worry about my weight, and just to focus on taking care of myself and my body. In terms of how strict this diet is – it is, and at the same time it isn’t. The list of foods we can eat is strict. But how much and how often we eat is entirely up to us, and that’s a beautiful thing in contrast to most weight loss plans. I am eating when I’m hungry – every time I get hungry – without worrying about counting calories or carbs or points, or weighing portions or fretting over various limits. I’m just eating. And what I’m eating are healthy, nutritious foods. I’m eating things I like (even though I’m not having *everything* I like). I’m trying new foods I hadn’t had before (turns out, I love the taste of buckwheat!) I am reminding myself that the foods I’m abstaining from were contributing to how sick I felt, and that I may be able to eat them again in the future (in moderation) once I’ve beaten the candida. And all of that is helping to keep me motivated. I hope some of this is helpful to you. I wish you the best of success on your own journey to beat candida!"
2,debthebee,667,"Thanks for the info Sarah! So would it not be better to be good for a few days, take a break one day and then continue properly than to just be bad for a few days? Or will all my effort be pointless from one day off? What worries me is that at the moment unless I’m on a diet I put on weight at a rate of about 2lbs a day…I wouldn’t like to gain more weight but then I don’t want to deprive myself for nothing either. I don’t want to do this diet, in fact I’m dreading it, but I need to do it. I’ve been unwell for so long but have never known what will actually help. I’m scared I won’t be able to stick with it. I find it difficult to go without tea or to drink green tea without sweeteners. I’m quite obsessed with my weight too, but even if I’m healthier I think I will still be unhappy if I am overweight. However, in my past experience I did a diet where I cut out a lot of stuff and I lost plenty of weight. It’s only now thinking about how I cut out most things that feeds candida that I realise why I lost the weight. It makes me feel a bit more confident that going on this diet will bring me down again and I have another diet I want to do when I’m well enough. I do agree with you though, that getting healthy needs to be put before losing weight. I’m really unhappy at my current weight though…I put on 12lbs in 9 days over Christmas and I haven’t been able to shift it despite diet and exercise. I don’t think I can even get hold of buckwheat in my little town so I doubt I’ll ever know what it is! I’m going to miss sweet yoghurt and fruit. Another question if you don’t mind. They say you should avoid cheese that is aged like blue cheese. I’m not really sure what other cheeses are aged though so I’m not sure what I can and can’t have."
3,sarah,667,"In terms of beating the candida, it will probably be about the same to wait a few days vs. start, stop, and start again. So, I would base the decision on what you think will serve you best overall in terms of your health and well being. If you choose to wait a few days before beginning, you can still make healthy choices and perhaps use the time to try a few recipes and prepare for the longer term plans. As far as tea and sweeteners – stevia and xylitol are the two sweeteners approved for the candida diet. Both come from natural sources, and neither promotes candida growth. With that said, I’ve always needed sweetener in my green tea, but I am doing this without any sweeteners (to try to overcome my lifelong cravings) and as time goes on I’m enjoying it more. I am finding that some varieties work better unsweetened than others. And I definitely prefer good quality loose leaf tea to the stuff in bags (I buy mine online and the prices end up just as good for better quality). It’s really easy to become discouraged thinking about the things we’re doing without. I definitely find my mood is better when I focus instead on what I can have, and on the opportunities to try new things and attempt new recipes. And, I’m hopeful that I’ll be able to add back a good number of things that are off the menu for now. My understanding is that cheese shouldn’t be eaten at all in Stage 1, but that fresh cheeses can be added back during Stage 2. Un-aged cheeses are usually soft or semisoft and don’t tend to have that sharp tanginess of aged cheese – cream cheese, fresh Mozzerella, Neufchatel, and cottage cheese are a few of the most common (in the U.S.) examples. Also – be prepared for die-off. I’ve been going through that most of this week, and it has been rough to stick with the plan when I’ve felt poorly. But, I’m feeling better today and confident that this is working! And in the end, it will definitely be worth it to feel healthier for the long run."
4,debthebee,667,"Thanks so much Sarah. What you’ve said is really encouraging and I feel a bit more positive about it all. I guess I will start properly in a few days then, although am trying to get used to plain yoghurt at the moment (can’t do low fat if there’s nothing to sweeten it!). Really glad xylitol is allowed, I think I can get that in my local supermarket. As for stevia I don’t think we have that in the UK but I’ll check and see if there’s something similar. I’ve heard of die off…I’m not sure how bad it will get but I think about what I’ve been through without medication and trying to hold down a job at the same time and I almost feel like nothing could be worse than that! The intestinal problems whilst working full time were the most awful thing I’ve ever experienced. The acne and weight problems have shot down my confidence and I think I’m ready to give this 100% :). Are your die off symptoms worse than the effects of Candida? And how soon do they come in? I’m going to start taking some psyllium husks to help with the bowel problems. I’ve read that taking Threelac you should have regular bowel movements or it will just make things worse, but I can’t do the detox on this site. It sounds way too much for me to do I think!"
5,sarah,667,"I’m glad it’s helpful to you! Yeah, I don’t like low fat plain yogurt. I’ve been using the whole milk stuff and I figure that I’m making up for it by giving up my cheese addiction! 😛 There’s a write up on die-off from this site here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-die-off.htm Myself, I’ve had a lot of fatigue this week, as well as sinus issues, constipation, headaches, and nausea. Drinking water and taking vitamin C has helped. But I’ve definitely felt more lethargic than normal and it’s been challenging to get my work done this week. I’d been on the diet 2 weeks when this started, and it seems to be easing up a bit now after 5+ days of this. Do make sure when you take the psyllium husks that you drink enough water – both with it and afterwards. Psyllium bulks a lot; it can definitely help get things moving but you need enough water to move it through."
6,whyitsme,667,"I think you need to set a start date, and stick to it. I tried doing the diet about 90-95% for a year. It helped, but still didn’t feel well. I like to say that I was training my will power. For once I decided to do it, I was going to do it 99.5%,(cheated a few times with vodka, but stayed away from beer and wine. Mostly not drinking) since I was tired of being sick and tired. I think it’s easier to put a block on the foods you can’t eat. (Grocery shopping can be somewhat depressing). I chose 6 months as my target. 3 months to make sure body rid of candida and 3 months to keep clean to heal. I started feeling noticeably better at 4 months, I am now at 5, and actually getting my energy back which is exciting. Last week have started minor cheating like teriyaki sauce, and had first piece of bread in 5 months. But still plan on being good for one more month. Though at beginning I told myself I get a couple beers on st. pattys day. If you cheat with the bad foods, the candida will just eat it and multiply. So you really need to just stop it altogether. Like others mentioned, I eat all the time, usually every 2 hours. No worries about calories, and you will lose weight. try full fat greek yogurt.full fat actually has less sugar than fat free, and it is better for your body to process since all natural in that state."
7,debthebee,667,"I posted this last month so have already started the diet. I’m in my 3rd week now and haven’t cheated as such but I did have some smoked salmon one day because I didn’t realise I wasn’t allowed it. I’ve been eating nuts without soaking them too, but I don’t think that’s a big deal. I’m steering clear of peanuts and pistachios as the diet says to. I have to say though, I’m not losing weight, in fact I’ve gained a few pounds which is pretty disappointing. I’m still holding out hope that my metabolism will pick up when the bacteria are all dead. I am eating all full fat stuff, but have decided to try lower fat organic butter and see if that makes a difference as I have been having a bit on rice cakes."
8,bhardwic,667,"debthebee~I am in the same boat you were back in February. I know I need to start this diet seriously, but keep cheating… Not sure how to give up my coffee and I am a chocolate fanatic~ But I am miserable with thrush on my tongue and throat. I am always tired and just want to feel normal. I see you finally started the diet and seem to be doing well… I can’t remember which one of you talked about not having bread in along time… Is there no bread out there without wheat or sugar? How about Ezekial bread? I tried Udi’s but now I see while there is no wheat there is some sugar. Ugh… I know I need to get this diet going, but was hoping to see improvement with the acupunture I’ve been going to…"
9,Whitney,667,As for bread I use samisbakery.com which has a good yeast free and sugar free millet / flax loaf bread. The diet can be a challenge but the real key to it is meal planning. Find a cookbook of recipes and plan your meals ahead of time so you don’t go hungry. There is nothing worse than getting stuck without a plan and trying to think through a yeast free meal. Good luck! ~Whitney
10,helmax,667,"Hello everyone in the thread. What an interesting thread, reading everyone’s story about the Candida diet. I’m seeing that people who haven’t been on the diet for very long are still eating things that I can’t touch. I did the same thing about 10 weeks into the diet. I thought that, since I was feeling so much better and experiencing less and less symptoms, that I could start adding a few things along. I started adding (gradually) 1/2 apple, a few tablespoons of raw old fashioned oatmeal, and 1/2 of a baked sweet potato. I was eating maybe one of these items every few days, and that was really all I was eating outside the diet. About two weeks after starting this, I was hit with a full blast of Candida symptoms. What I didn’t realize earlier was that in the beginning I had a very, very mild case of Candida. If you’re having somewhat ‘mild’ symptoms, then you very likely have a mild case of Candida. This of course is in my opinion due to my own experience. I am now very deep into a strict Candida diet. The only salt I can eat without having a reaction is Himalayan Sea Salt. If I eat meat that has been injected with sodium for preservation, I have terrible reactions for at least several days. I’m on thyroid meds from thyroid surgery, and about 4 months after contracting Candida, my thyroid hormone level dropped so low that the doctor thought it was a mistake, of course she eventually raised my dosage. Since I can’t eat regular salt with iodine, I started having symptoms of low iodine levels, so now I’m also taking an iodine supplement.  I can’t use toothpaste, because so far I haven’t found any that doesn’t have a list of ingredients that I’m afraid of, plus all I’ve seen contains some type of sugar alcohol or substitute. I use baking soda and H2O2 on my toothbrush. I can’t have sugar substitutes without a reaction, even Xylitol which I received reactions from immediately. Probably because one teaspoon of it contains 4 grams of Sugar Alcohols, and I can’t have any of this due to reactions shortly afterwards. I did find one type which my health food store owner suggested, it’s pure Stevia extract. I’m only barely using it at the moment, but so far have had no reactions.  Someone mentioned Millet & Flax Bread, I can’t eat this because it has 90mg of sodium, and even though it’s regular sea salt, I have reactions to this (I’ve tried it). This is probably due the way it’s processed and possible other ingredients. I try not to go out to eat, but if I absolutely can’t get out of it, I always go to the salad bar, and that’s it. No meat at all and no salad dressing. I obtain several slices of lemon and use as a salad dressing. All the above is just a sample how bad it’s gotten. I’m not really trying to scare anyone, but I really want everyone to realize that, if you start having immediate, very uncomfortable reactions to foods, you will have no choice but to become completely serious about the diet. Thanks for your interest.  Sky"

Don’t ask me how cause it was trial and error, but I finally discovered the little pest “Candida”. Among dozens of other problems its caused for me there’s Asthma. I’ve discovered a little herbal concoction that alieviates not just the asthma but has now become part of my bed-time routine. I take 1 large clove of garlic (or 2 smal) and slice it up.

0,Sash,670,"Hey, so ive been on the diet for a while now (since february) and i was planning on taking the anti fungal diflucan in may. Im going on vaccation in july(alcohol will be consumed… i know i know its not clever of me to drink whilst on this programme) so i want to feel at my best with my candida symptoms at a mininum if any… So my initial plan was to take a couse of diflucan throughout may/june and then continue with supplements whilst on vaccation. But im now thinking may is too late to take the diflucan as its a really strong drug and is stressful on the liver and il be drinking on my vaccation. So Do you think it would be best to just stick to rotating natural anti fungals (grapefruit seed extract, garlic, apple cider vinegar etc) or will i be okay to take the diflucan and not have to worry about my symptoms reoccuring whilst on vacc? Please help!! Ps – What natural anti fungals do you recommend? Thanx flipperflop, ive just decdided im going to stick with natural anti fungals, not decided which yet but i will take 3 on rotation. Im worried i may build up a resistance to the diflucan which i would get most benefits from using after my vaccation rather than before so im just going to hold off and take a course in august. I also read alot about how its hard on the liver so i dont want to risk being ill whilst on vacc. Although, the diflucan has really good reviews and seems to be one of the best anti fungals out there so i would recommend it, but just take caution."
1,flipperflop,670,I use oil of oregano. and my naturopath suggests i take it whenever i cheat. like 2-5 drops in the am and in the pm. I havent taken diflucan since my symptoms first started 3 years ago. Back then it didnt help me at all. But my family physician suggested taking it recently. My symptoms are relatively gone but I was thinking of taking it just to knock out any candida that may still be in my system. But ièm hestitant. I didnt realize it was hard on the liver so that makes me even more hesitatnt. I cant imagine it being to bad if you just take it once or twice. Taking it anymore maybe but it cant be that bad. can it?

Nasal sprays havent cured the problem so my doc is wondering wheter the excess musuc is from my chest so has perscribed me with Lansoprazole, i think its mainly perscribed to reduce acid. I looked at the ingredients and they contain maize starch & sucrose. Will this have an effect on candida? .. Soon i will be taking candida-abx supplements so im worried combining both will give me bad side effects. Is it worth taking them or not?.. im not sure"
1,kelandu,672,I aslo have the nasal drip which seems to clear when i get things under control . I think once you have the candida under control and see results this will stop. I was on a similar treatment for years but interstingly i have since discovered i dont need them! most people have too little stomach acid not too much and these pills suppress the acid. I dont understand why the doctor has given you these pills since they are used to control and lessen the acid. i think they would cause more probles to be honest. You will find that once you find a good anti fungal the drip should lessen and stop. Its part of candida. Its up to you whether you take these pills but i wouldnt advice them if you have no stomach problems x
2,flipperflop,672,"I wouldnt take it. I had heart burn/ reflux. Doc gave me nexium and my candida symptoms got REALLY bad. Stomach felt nice but everything else like shit. Apple cider vinegar diluted in water helps reflux. DGL also. Try to stay away from meds, in my experience it messes with your system that you are trying to naturally re-build. Just tailor your diet and use natural remedies, in my opinion."
0,Alex27,673,"I’ve been doing the candida diet for a few weeks with varying results. I woke up this morning with a calm stomach and without my usual symptoms. I had breakfast and then felt fine. I’m on anti-depressants at the moment (Venlafaxine)and about half an hour after taking my daily pill, my symptoms returned. I then looked on the ingredients list and they look like they have some form of sugar in them. Obviously then, it is not safe for me to be taking them, right? Could use some advice please. This whole candida thing is playing with my mind. I have struggled with stomach and back pains, constipation, headaches, mood swings, skin rash, fatigue, heartburn, insomnia, depression for several years now and I had come to identify myself as an ‘ongoing depressive’, and partially believed that my stomach issues were a symptom of the depression. After doing research and learning about candida, I am beginning to believe that it is the other way round, i.e. my depression is a symptom of my stomach issues, candida. Part of me is jubilant that I have found a solution to all those above symptoms which I had come to believe were ‘part of my personality’. Another part of me is angry it took me almost ten years to find out about Candida. I visited the doctor many times over the years and none of them mentioned candida. Also, a nutritionist I saw never mentioned it. Anyway, I must be positive as at least I have found a probable solution now and that is all that really matters. Also, what about vitamins? Want to take a vitamin C supplement but most of them have some strange ingredients. Many thanks."
1,candide,673,"I used to take Venlafaxine myself – Stopped in Nov 2010 or so. It *always* made my stomach feel funny. I found myself nauseous almost every morning from it. Usually i’d eat something with it to calm the effect. I stopped taking Venlafaxine though. While I liked the benefits, the downsides were bad for me. It gave me frequent headaches, lots of gas – and I mean ENORMOUS amounts of gas, made me VERY groggy in the morning until i had coffee, among a number of other things… That, coupled with candida… not a good mix! I stayed on it for about 5 months. Hope that helps?"

1,candide,676,"Well, I’ve just tried taking the Sonne’s #7 – 1 Tsp – in about 1 cup of water, mixed with 1 Tsp of Psyllium Husk. I have a feeling I should be doubling or so the dosage of Sonne’s but its hard to tell. I’ll let you know how it goes. Any advice from others would be appreciated."
0,lagirl66,677,"Hi. I am new to this forum. I believe that I have candida. It started out as bacterial overgrowth from overuse of antibiotics. But I have had SEVERE abdominal pain (like critters eating away at my intestines) for 6 months now. What ever I try, the pain never goes away. I have been eating a no sugar, very low carb diet for a month now, and I did go through some sort of a detox. But the pain will not stop. Any advice on what to do about this?? I have gone through tests to rule out other things and they came out fine. I am sick of this pain. Please help me. Thanks, Trish"
1,debthebee,677,Unfortunately everyone on here is pretty much in the same boat as you and your abdominal pain sounds like it could be something else causing it so the best advice would be to see a doctor or preferably a gastroenterologist.
2,lagirl66,677,"debthebee, Thankyou for your reply. I have had a bunch of tests done for the pain, and they all came out fine. That is why I am thinking it is still the overgrowth causing the pain. I don’t have a gastro doctor right now. I have seen all of them in my area and they basically dismissed my pain. They were jerks. Do people with candida have this pain? Thanks Trish"
3,debthebee,677,"If you don’t mind me asking, what testing did you have done? I think symptoms vary from one person to another and abdominal pain and discomfort is one of the symptoms but mine has never been so severe unless it was to do with trapped wind or eaten a food with high concentrations of sugar like dried fruit. If it is related to the Candida then I can only think that you possibly have a very severe case. What kind of pain is it exactly? Is it in your intestines and are there any other symptoms e.g. bloating, noticeable feeling of movements? You said you were doing a no carb, low sugar diet but there are a lot of other foods that can still contribute to helping the Candida grow. You could try doing the cleanse as mentioned on this website. Because so many foods are cut out at that stage, if your symptoms disappear then you will be able to tell which foods aggravate your pain by slowly adding them back. I didn’t do the cleanse but that was because no one food makes my symptoms worse. Most foods have the same effect so just going with natural foods with no additives has made a difference. Also is there anything else that you have noticed that makes your symptoms flare up? The worrying thing is that severe abdominal pain can be an indicator of a serious illness, but I would think doctors would be able to pick up on that."
4,lagirl66,677,"debthebee, I should mention that I also have gastroparesis(delayed emptying of the stomach) and ibs(diarrhea) and I am fructose intollorant. I hope that helps. The testing I had done was blood work, a ct scan of the abdominals, and endoscopy. The blood work and ct scan came out great. That was my doctors words. The endoscopy was done by a GI doctor, and found alot of acid buildup and she had to stretch my hole (where the food exits) because it was very small and inflamed. The pain I have had never moved. It is always in the same place. Where the small intestine is. It is not in the stomach. And it is as though little critters are nawing at my intestines. It is horrible. I have had this same pain everyday, for 6 months. The pain dosent move around it is always in the middle of my intestines. I have extremely severe bloating from IBS but it has been alot worse since I got this. I was having alot of diarrhea to. But then I started taking the probiotic culturelle and it stoped. I hope I am taking the right one. I made a stevia candy bar the other night with just bakers chocolate unsweetened and stevia. I was in so much pain the next day I thought I was goind to die. I hope this gives you some ideas. I also drink juice out of green veggies, since I can’t eat them raw. I can’t eat much at all. I can only eat once a day right now, and I have lost over 60 pounds and I am still losing. Thanks Trish"
5,debthebee,677,"So are you being treated for gastroparesis? The IBS can be a symptom of Candida, I have that too. Except I started taking psyllium husks and it has REALLY helped. I would really recommend doing the detox drink in the cleanse stage of the diet even if you can’t stomach the cleanse itself. It’s made with psyllium husks and betonite clay which is really good at clearing out toxins so it could be a big help. The psyllium husks also help with diarrhea as it binds everything together. I think there is a possibility your pain is caused by the bacteria and if it is, doing this diet will help a lot. I would also suggest some liver support such as milk thistle. The liver contributes a lot to the digestive process so I would try everything possible if I was having the problems you are. Acid build up could be to do with your liver not functioning properly. Are you vomiting at all? Have a look at this link: http://liver-disease-symptoms.com/. This will help determine if your pain could be related to your liver under performing. As far as I can tell, an endoscopy doesn’t directly check your liver so this is something doctors could have missed. I could be wrong though. As for probiotics, Threelac has a good reputation and is specifically designed to kill Candida. It also has a 60 day money back guarantee. Also, do you have other symptoms of Candida? And what other foods are you eating? You mentioned chocolate…I assume that’s cocoa powder? That isn’t allowed on the diet because of the caffeine content which feeds the Candida. So if you definitely have bacterial overgrowth you’ve got to eat all the foods that kill it off and stick it out through the die off."
6,lagirl66,677,"Right now I am not being treated for gastroparesis. There are only two medications for it and they can do further damage to your health. It is just not worth the risk. One of the symtoms is parkinsons type symptoms of shaking and such. And it happened to me. Luckily I stopped it right away and the symptoms stopped. The only thing I am concerned about the detox is diarrhea. I have chronic diarrhea from ibs. I am taking questran to control that. I am not vomiting at all. Alot of people have vomiting with GP and I have never had that. As far as I know, my liver is fine. I have had it tested and the last time it was fine. Also, my bowel movements are very dark. Where could I get this Threelac? How expensive is it? I am constantly weak, but that may be my painpills. I take tramadol. I have constant sinus problems. I have been through 5 surgeries to remove sinus polyps. I don’t know about the other symptoms of candida I will have to look them up. The foods that I am eating right now are homemade chicken patties, and egg white omlets. And I do make baked items from almond flour with stevia as the sweetener. Could that be causing the pain? What about coffee??? I drink it every morning. So I can get my BM out. I have to, or I will be in more pain from them staying inside me. I know it is kind of gross to tell you all this, but it is true. I am disabled from all my problems. Legally. I now recieve disability.  I guess I should stop the coffee huh? Well, let me know what you think. And thanks for the advice. Trish"
7,debthebee,677,"Like I mentioned above, the psyllium husks helps diarrhea as it binds everything together. It’s been a great help to me as before even when I had a regular bowel movement the stools would be loose and separated, but they are not like that anymore. So trust me, it works. I was ill on my first day of this diet but that was just from such a drastic change in diet I think and I felt better the next day. But as for coffee, it contains a lot of caffeine and feeds the candida so you need to cut out the caffeine altogether. I understand why you are not being treated for gastroparesis, but I should imagine this is a contributory factor to your pain. It makes sense…if your stomach is not emptying at the correct rate then everything is slowing down and fermenting in your stomach which is then being passed on to your intestines and that would increase the candida symptoms too. I’m in the UK so I couldn’t tell you how much it is in dollars, but it’s £39 which I think is around $50. It is expensive but with a money back guarantee if you don’t see an improvement in 60 days you can get your money back. Just do a search on Google for Threelac. It’s manufactured by Global Health Trax. I don’t know what’s in Stevia either as we don’t have it in the UK but I don’t think it should cause you pain. You may have an intolerance to certain foods, I’m not sure. The only way to tell is to visit the main site http://www.thecandidadiet.com and do the cleanse/detox and see how you feel. Almond flour should be fine though. I’m sorry I can’t be of much more help, but if you can afford to I would suggest trying natural remedies like acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the GP and ginger is also supposed to help the stomach empty its contents. So try adding more ginger to your food…ground ginger in yoghurt perhaps and fresh ginger in meals. There are some great recipes on this site so have a look and also see if you can guy ginger capsules. Also Swedish bitters, if you have that in LA and perhaps a massage of the abdominal area. I know everything costs money, but sometimes you have to ask yourself, what is my health worth? For me, I will spend the money I have to to get better."
8,lagirl66,677,"Thanks for all your advice. One thing about the cleanse. I don’t think I can do it because with GP, we can not have any fiber at all and I read that these things have fiber for the cleanse. Fiber slows the stomach down even more. I also have a question. Does coco powder have caffine? I ate some chocolate and was immediately in so much pain. OH I am not in LA. That is just my email cause I was born there. I actually live in Iowa. You are right about my stomach not emptying and having it get worse. I am trying to find a herb that will help that. I didn’t know that ginger did that. That is great. I sprinkle ginger on my chicken everyday. You are right. I will spend the money if it will help me. Thanks again"
9,debthebee,677,"Yes psyllium husks is fibre…but I don’t really understand why you can’t have it? Is that just digestible fibre? The psyllium husks are indigestible so maybe that will make a difference. It seems contradictory for GP to not be allowed fibre…fibre helps your bowel movements so without it your GP symptoms might not be worse but your bowel movements won’t improve. The psyllium husks are also used as a regular dietary supplement to improve and maintain regular GI transit. The inert bulk of the husks helps provide a constant volume of solid material irrespective of other aspects of the diet or any disease condition of the gut. But if you are unsure, it might be best to consult a specialist before undergoing the cleanse. I don’t want it to worsen your condition and I’m no expert.Have the consultants you’ve seen not been able to suggest what you can do to cure the condition? I’ve read that the antidepressant mirtazapine has also proven effective in the treatment of gastroparesis unresponsive to conventional treatment. So maybe ask your doctor about that. These doctors can’t just leave you to suffer with your condition. I think you need to get the GP sorted before you feel better. I read that if medicine hasn’t worked, surgery would be the next step. If they’ve been able to diagnose it they must know what has caused it and you must push for answers."
10,apctech,677,"Hi, fellow Iowan! I also have IBS and I know that feeling of little critters gnawing at my intestines. It’s probably inflammation. The thing that I found that helps me is Extreme Immunity. http://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Immunity-Immunolin-300-Gram-Plastic/dp/B0010ZJTM4 I just mix one scoopful with yogurt or applesauce or whatever and eat it. I noticed an improvement in my IBS within a week, and those ‘little critters’ went away too. By the way, cocoa powder does have caffeine, which is something I avoid like the plague because of my GERD."
11,lagirl66,677,"debthebee, My doctors have been of no help at all when it comes to GP. When I was first diagnosed, the doctors told me nothing about diet or anything. All he said was go online. He was a jerk. Remember me telling you how bad my stomach was and the doctor had to stretch the hole? Well, the first jerk I saw knew this and he left it in that shape. I think that is why I got worse. The doctor that did my endoscopy was great. But she was only here practicing for 6 months. Now she is gone. I have seen all of them in my area and they always dismiss me. Not wanting to help. So I am really in a bind with that. I will probably have to travel to the next biggest city, which is cedar rapids. Everyone I know that has GP knows that fiber is a big NO NO. What will happen is the food will move even slower, and we could develope a bzoar. It is like a hairball in a cat. The food just clumps up and wont move any further. Then it has to be surgically removed. I am so scared of that. So I stay away from all fiber. I will ask about that antidepressant. But it will depends what the side effects are. I have pushed for answers, but they do nothing."
12,lagirl66,677,Hi apctech! I am glad to find another Iowan! Thanks for the advice. Where could I get this Extreme immunity? I thought the “critters” were the bacteria or yeast? It is immflamation? I will definetely try that. Thanks for the advice about the coco powder. This really depresses me. Now I have nothing to snack on.  Trish
13,apctech,677,"I order Extreme Immunity from that Amazon website that I linked to my previous post. You can also order it from this website. http://www.extremeimmunity.com/ I think this stuff is anti-Candida, because when I first started taking it, I had die-off symptoms similar to when I started taking probiotics and coconut oil. But it was worth going through the misery of that because the IBS is so much better. If you try it, I hope it helps you!"
14,Andrew111,677,"Dear Lagirl66: Sorry to hear about your trials and tribulations with candida. It can be a very problematic issue to get rid of and of course, as you know, causes many aggravating health issues. I discovered a wonderful educational article I’d love to share with you that gives you some resources with which to fight this pesky condition. Here’s wishing you the best of health! Candida Education"
0,Jared,678,"Hi all, I have been fighting Candida for about 3 or 4 years now – I am sooooo much better than I used to be but despite keeping to a strict diet for many months and taking all sorts of different supplements I can’t seem to shift it completely. I’m on a carb-free diet at the moment and it’s making me feel worse (a good sign) I’ve also upped the amount of anti-fungal stuff I’m taking (five-lac, apple cider vinegar, raw garlic, clove oil, caprylic acid, olive leaf extract) but I just don’t feel like I’m ever going to get rid of it completely. I just wondered if anyone had experienced getting rid of Candida completely and could therefore resume a normal diet? I was also wondering about the 7 day fast. It’s obviously going to be tough and I’d need to take time off work – I suppose I just want to know if it’s worth it. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks Jared"
1,Ca7,678,"Jared wrote: Hi all, * … getting rid of Candida completely… ? * … 7 day fast ? Hello, interesting questions, I strongly hope to soon answer positively to the 1st one (and I agree, I didn’t run across many people who manage to cure completely a full blown candidasis, may be because once it’s done they don’t bother with the forums?) and for the 2nd it depends on many factors : * Is the candida able to feed in blood and tissues ? It got roots, so it’s probably able to get something from it so you are probably going to get hungry faster than it! * A 7 days diet is certainly wreaking the immune system! No good! * Candida like surfaces because it’s easier to feed there, it eats every-time you do and at the same time it’s easier to escape immunity because macrophages are not hunting into the mouth or the intestinal juice. So we probably need to keep pushing on the 2 sides : external parts and roots! The problem is that protocols seem to be quite blurry. Also bacterial-antibiotics generate so many unbalance that re-balancing all that along with previous diet mistakes is fundamental, but on the hard medecine side, the idea to take a strong antifungal with even more side effect than the accused antibiotic is really frightening especially faced with physician who constantly minimize the risks. By the way have you tried synthetical antifongics ?"
0,Andrew111,679,Thank you for having such a wonderful forum with a wealth of educational  knowledge to help those who suffer with yeast overgrowth. I believe that candida is quickly becoming pandemic and is a great contributor to a host of other  health issues. I do believe one can win this war against candida through  education and using the most effective products to restore one’s health. I am  listing an excellent educational article that I am sure will be a great resource  to many who suffer with this debilitating condition. Being a candida sufferer I  have followed these protocols and have seen amazing results and an overall  healing of all the spin-off issues that are often a result of candida. You can  win this fight! http://holistiwisdom.com/candida/
0,Alex27,680,"Maybe I am being stupid but I am confused about yogurt. I have been eating plain organic yogurt with no added sugar. I am in the detox stage of the diet and I’ve been reading conflicting reports and I’m thinking about eliminating it for the time being, perhaps until I am sure the candida is dead. Any advice? Many thanks."
1,sarah,680,"Plain unsweetened yogurt can be beneficial since it contains live cultures that help replenish the healthy bacteria in your body, much like probiotic supplements, and these bacteria help prevent the overgrowth of candida. At the same time, even unsweetened yogurt does naturally contain some milk sugars, and some people have sensitivities to dairy products. So, like a number of things on this diet, it’s generally allowed but some people have to proceed with caution. Myself, I went completely dairy free for about the first two weeks of this diet. Then, I had several servings of unsweetened plain kefir (a cultured milk drink that is similar to yogurt but not as thick). My nasal/sinus symptoms seemed to get worse immediately. I’m not positive whether this was the result of the dairy, or whether it was just a coincidence and I was starting to experience die-off symptoms. I’m going without the kefir again for a few days to see if it helps (so far it hasn’t, and I currently suspect this is just die-off and not a food reaction). In a couple more days I’ll try adding it back and see if it makes things worse."
2,Terrylee5151,680,Alex I didn’t do the yogurt until later in the candida diet. Yogurt has some sugar in it and I waited to use it at about the same time I added fruit back in.
3,Alex27,680,Many thanks for the advice. It is much appreciated. I think I am going to leave yogurt out for a couple of weeks and see how it goes. Cheers
4,whyitsme,680,"I waited until week 8 to add back yogurt as a main staple, since with all the allergies candida caused I had previously had some issues with it. (Think I had twice during that 8 weeks). I eat full fat greek yogurt. I added frozen bluebeeries and raspberries to it(to sweeten it). I hadn’t eaten berries until week 8 either at that point. I now have a bowl of it with berries, probably 3-5 times a week. I then added daily probiotics (10 million cultures) for about 45 days at about 10 weeks. I now only take about 3-4 times a week (8 million)."
0,yeti,681,Does anyone know if soya milk is ok to drink whilst on this diet?
1,nomoflareup,681,According to my research you are suppose to have only almond milk. No soy products at all. I look forward to continue the candida diet that I was on a few days before starting my detox/fast option 2. I’m on day 4 now. Good luck with your new diet!
0,tetrad,682,I have started the cleansing phase (option 2) and on my second day. The die of effects are so bad I’m vomitting and can’t even keep water down – which is not good considering yopu really need to drink plenty of water. What am I to do??
1,Star69,682,"Sorry I don’t have any advice but I was going to say the same thing. I’ve attempted the cleanse 3 times and every single time have been violently sick on day 3. I also get incredibly shakey, am unable to walk unaided and am completely incapacitated for a day. I have been unable to continue with the cleanse after this. Does anyone know of anything we can do to minimise these symptoms?"
2,jlong,682,I took Dramamine for the nausea. I was having a lot of heartburn also..and was taking Zantac. Then I read somewhere on line not to take the antacids as it encourages candida growth.
3,nomoflareup,682,"I’m new to this forum but, I have done a lot of fasting in the past. I am on day 3 now, option 2, but, yesterday was my worst day so far. This one does give me some flulike symptoms, a cough, a bit of headache and teary eyes, die off? Unless I did pick up a cold the other day when I was exposed. Had a real bad flare up 1 week ago. Thought I was feeling better, so all last week I had pretty much what I wanted, chocolate, cinnamon buns, smoked salmon, coffee and coffeecake being the last thing that did me in! Got so sick and got so worried, cause I’ve been nothing but sick these last 2 month. How could I forget all about the candida that I had already diagnosed myself with early January?! Did the spit test and I had a lot of symptoms. I don’t know, guess I didn’t think I was that ill. Anyways, after the flare up I put myself on a liberal candida diet for 4 days. Weaned myself off caffeine, a little less every day and also prepared myself mentally that I wasn’t going to eat for 7 days. Did have some grapefruit juice day one and day 3, as my broth wasn’t ready and I was feeling weak. Maybe, that is what made the difference. I’ve read on other sites that you can have  GF juice and I did juice it myself. Also, as soon as you feel a little out of it, have something, water a herbal tea, that will make you a little happier. Mint tea and/or ginger tea should be good. Be gentle to yourself."
0,Sash,683,"Okay well my only symptom of candida is bad breath, i dont have any other of the common symptoms such as fatigue, constipation etc The only thing thats keeping me on this path is that i have a fured coating on my tonuge, i also suffer from post nasal drip which i think contributes to bad breath. I have been on the diet for 4 weeks now and no improvements in my breath, although the fured coating has somewhat reduced.. should i continue or is this a seperate matter i need to deal with. Any advice would be helpful! Hey sarah, yes i have ruled out any possible causes and im just guessing its an imbalance in flora which is causing fured coating and an overproduction of anaerobic bacteria. I really dont know what to do, this diet is hard enough but not knowing wheter this is definatly the right path makes it even tougher 🙁"
1,sarah,683,"Since you don’t have any other candida symptoms, and since your symptom hasn’t improved, you may want to look into other possible causes. Aside from candida, bad breath can be caused by eating certain foods, insufficient dental hygiene, gum disease, infections in the teeth/gums, respiratory system, or sinuses, as well as diabetes and even liver and kidney problems. If you are brushing, flossing, and using a floride rinse daily, and if you aren’t eating foods known to cause halitosis (like garlic and onions), then it’s probably time to see a doctor."
0,debthebee,684,"I was reading the “foods to eat” and “foods to avoid” but there are a lot of things missed out on these lists which makes me wonder if we are still allowed them. I understand the “foods to eat” will be things that will help fight off the candida and the “foods to avoid” will feed it but it does make me curious about foods we are allowed to eat. For example, we should eat yoghurt because of the probiotics in it, but what about milk? Ok I realise we should limit dairy but is this because it feeds the candida or that some people are extra sensitive to it? I don’t have a lot of trouble with nasal congestion so dairy doesn’t bother me that much. Also things like soba noodles, coconut milk and chickpeas are not in the “foods to eat” list but are mentioned in the recipes for stage one so I find it a little confusing. And if we are allowed coconut milk, then is it ok to eat fresh coconut?"
1,sarah,684,"Some of it varies from one person to the next. It helps to read food labels to know the nutritional content of various foods which can help clarify. Milk contains a lot of natural sugar, which can feed candida, so it’s recommended to avoid it until the final stage of the diet. Some people do well to reduce their overall dairy intake long term. Chickpeas are a bean/legume and my understanding is they can be added back in Stage 2. I am actually cooking a batch right now! 🙂 Going to make hummus. I’m not positive, but I believe fresh coconut is okay. Fresh coconut does have a higher sugar content than coconut oil and milk though so proceed with caution and see what affect it has on you. What are the ingredients in soba noodles? That should tell you when they can be added."
2,debthebee,684,"I’ve been eating yoghurt and I’ve been ok. Not sure if milk and yoghurt are the same with how much sugar they contain though. The foods to eat says you can have yoghurt this so I’m assuming it will help fight the candida. As for the chickpeas and soba noodles, the reason I mention them is that they are in the recipes on this website for all stages. So this seems to mean we can eat them in stage 1 unless that is a mistake so it’s a bit confusing."
3,sarah,684,"Yogurt has less sugar than non-cultured milk, as the bacteria in the yogurt metabolize much of the lactose. It still has some, but notably less than regular milk. And, it also provides beneficial (probiotic) bacteria that are worthwhile to the fight against candida. Regular milk does not. I suspect the recipe(s) that say chickpeas in Stage 1 are a mistake. Chickpeas are specifically listed among the “foods to reintroduce” in Stage 2: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/foods-to-reintroduce.htm But I also Googled soba noodles, and read that they are made from buckwheat which is non-glutinous and on the “foods to eat” list for Stage 1. I hope this helps!"
4,debthebee,684,"Yes that’s very helpful, thanks Sarah :). You sound like a pro! I couldn’t find any soba noodles in my supermarket, but I found some Thai noodles that are under the brand name “King Soba” so I thought they might be ok. They don’t contain buckwheat, but they are gluten free and contain organic rice flour. Do you think that would be an ok substitute?"
5,sarah,684,"You’re welcome! Honestly I’m pretty new to this myself, but I read up on candida for months before beginning the diet to try to get a good understanding of it all. I’ve been sticking to brown rice flour and avoiding white rice flour, personally. The fiber in whole grains really does help, both to keep your blood sugar steadier and also to provide the cleansing effect fiber offers. I’m avoiding refined flours for now and will add them back in moderate amounts in Stage 3. If you do decide to use noodles made from white rice flour, I definitely suggest keeping your portions small and paying attention to how your body responds."
6,debthebee,684,"Yeah unfortunately it doesn’t say whether it’s white rice flour or brown, but I guess I sort of assumed that if it was organic it would be brown. The foods to eat says you can eat brown or wild rice…I’m not sure what wild rice is though. Could that be considered organic rice? I hope it’s ok though…it doesn’t contain any gluten but I’ll see how I get on."
7,sarah,684,"Generally speaking, if it doesn’t specify that it’s whole grain/ brown rice, then it’s white rice. Wild rice technically isn’t rice; it’s the seed of a certain grass. The grains are long (maybe twice the length of rice), slender, and black or dark brown."
0,Charlotte,685,"Hi, This has been a really tough 2 days! started yesterday on the diet, and am feeling seriously bad, it’s like going off drugs! I never knew how much sugar I was eating, and now after 36hrs of not having any, I am feeling shaky, bad tempered and keep wandering aimlessly into the kitchen looking for something to eat that ISN’T sugar. I’m not hungry! had a really good omelette for breakfast and fish salad for lunch, but am craving like mad!! how long is this going to last???"
1,michellecx,685,I think you need to find something that is acceptable but also you like the taste of – as if it were a treat. Rice cakes did it for me. Michelle
2,debthebee,685,"I started yesterday and was feeling awful too, but I didn’t eat that much sugar before as I was trying to diet to lose weight. Although on Sunday before I started I did overload myself with sugar, bad carbs and caffeine because I knew I wouldn’t be able to do it again for some time. I am feeling a bit better today. Woke up with a headache but after taking some high strength paracetamol am feeling a bit better. I reckon feeling that way is probably a mixture of things including caffeine withdrawal and it’s a shock to the system making such drastic changes to your diet. It does make you feel like crying and giving up but the thing that’s keeping me going is knowing one day I will be free of this illness and be in much better health. I don’t think we are allowed rice cakes in stage one unless there are no additives and it’s made from brown rice, but we are allowed xylitol which I use in fruit tea and in plain yoghurt. That might help, but I reckon the cravings will go away in a few days once your body has adjusted to the massive change."
3,sarah,685,"Cravings definitely get better with time. I find it’s important not to let myself get over-hungry. When I’m reeeeally hungry is when the sugar cravings will hit. I also find it helpful to have a servings of grain, veggies, etc. – something with a bit of carbs – when I’m having a sugar craving. Hang in there! It will get better."
4,Sash,685,"Well im on my fourth week now and believe me it doesnt get easier.. not to put you off or anything! i found that having herbal teas helps the sugar cravings a little, try rooibos tea, it contains no caffiene so you can have a few a day, when i first tried it i thought ewwww but ive really grew to like it, its like a tutti frutti taste 🙂 For snack i would suggest pumpkin seeds and almonds, hazelnuts are pushing it if you have too many but a small handful a day are acceptable. Also you should try organic rice cakes, theres a few toppings in the ‘candida recipes, snacks’ such as salsa, guacamolli, but if you want to be strict with this diet dont have more than 4 a day.

0,rubyred,687,"I’m working on creating a meal plan to help me get started and stick with the candida diet. I was wondering if anyone knew if raw dairy is acceptable on this diet? Specifically, raw cow’s milk and raw cheese & raw butter made from cow’s milk. I see that plain yogurt is acceptable on the diet, so I’d assume that raw yogurt is acceptable. Please advise. Thank you!"
1,debthebee,687,"Hi Ruby, I’m not an expert and have just started on this diet but from what I’ve read dairy should be limited and cheese avoided completely in the first stage. In stage 2 you can add in fresh cheese. In the first stage you are allowed plain probiotic yoghurt because it contains good bacteria, but I’m not sure about milk. I have avoided it because I am unsure. Organic butter is allowed too, I’m not sure if raw butter counts as organic but I guess it is dependent on the ingredients and if anything is added."

3,jlong,689,I am not sure if it is coming out of my teeth now. I do have white things with brown cyrtal-like strutures coming out of my tongue. I think it is those. I went to the eye doctor last friday and he said I had crystal like structures in the roots of my eyelashes. Is this dead yeast?

0,Samantharae1,690,"Hello everyone, I am new to this, I am starting tomorrow with the cleansing. I take Vitamin K and D and Magnesium and some probiotics, is it ok to keep taking these during the 7 day no food? Also it says that the cleansing lasts 3 weeks, I only eat nothing for 7 days then eat some stuff, is that correct? Sorry, I am new and don’t want to screw this up because I am pretty sure it has been on going for about a year without much help. I took antiboitics for strep about a year ago, after two months of problems afterwards I went back, she said this is what I had, Candida. To go a a clear liquid diet for 3-4 days and start eating normally slowly and try and eat yogurt, that was that and I did it. Well a year later and I am still having problems. So I want to try this, but want to make sure if I am going to do it, I do it right. Pretty sure NO ONE likes to NOT eat! haha I am a HUGE fan of food, so this should be interesting! Thanks for any help you can offer! Samantha-Rae"
1,Terrylee5151,690,So you are not eating anything for 7 days??// Wow!!! I have a candida diet on my blog if you are interested…. http://myjourneywithcandida.blogspot.com/2010/02/candida-diet.html
2,JustSayNOYeast,690,"I was going to log on with the same question. I take a regular series of Vitamins & Supplements too. I can’t find anything saying whether to continue to do so during the Candida Cleanse. I’m starting today and just to be on the safe side, I’m going to continue to take them, but check their labels for glucose. Most Vitamins & Supplements these days are “Yeast Free” and say so on their packaging, so my guess is it should be alright. Good Luck!"
3,Samantharae1,690,"I just finished my last day for the fasting. I didn’t take anything but the probiotics while I was fasting. I didn’t want to risk it. I have noticed huges changes. My skin started to clear up and not be dry after only one day! I have to say day 2 was the hardest for me. Good luck! Something that I found that helped me when I was wanting to eat, just smell the food. Like my boyfriend was eating some chips next to me on the couch and I just smelled the bag of them and was fine not having any."

0,mtgirl,691,"I was received a letter from my GI Doc., stating that after having a endoscope I “most likely” have Candida. I have never heard of it but just started to research it tonight. I have downloaded so many foods that you can eat can’t eat. Most are the same. This diagnosis makes so much sense for all that I have been going through. I am so excited to start on the change in my eating habits. I am mostly a very healthy eater, but will be cutting out all cereals and any processed food I eat. I have two questions: One can I eat egg whites out of carton? (seems like no) , two can I use natural lemon/lime packets or real fresh lemons/limes? If you have any input it will be greatly appreciated as I start on my journey. They also put me on Diflucan for 2 weeks. Also can I refer to the celiac diet as well for guidance? Thanks in advance."
1,HealMyGuts,691,"Hi there! When you say “egg whites out of a carton” I suppose you mean something like Egg Beaters. These should be avoided no matter what diet you are on. The bottom line is that Egg Beaters is not even real food. If you look at their website, they constantly use the phrase “liquid egg product.” This is because Egg Beaters is not actually “liquid eggs.” It is a manufactured “food product.” That is not something that you want to be eating. If you live in an area that has a farmer’s market, that would be a great place to go to get not only your eggs, but many of your other groceries as well. At a farmer’s market you can talk to the people who actually grow the food or raise the animals that produce the food, so you can be sure that it is the highest quality you can get. Not only is it better for you, but you will be amazed at how good it tastes. Next best would be to try and find locally grown/raised food in a supermarket. If that isn’t an option, most supermarkets have organic food sections these days. The same thing goes with lemon and limes. A small amount of Lemon or Lime juice is O.K., but they do contain fructose which should be avoided. Real fresh-squeezed juice is the best for this also. When wondering if a food is O.K. to eat, just ask yourself, “Did this come out of the Earth, or out of a factory?” That is a good place to start, and then you can go on to figure out if it is Candida-Safe or not. Good Luck!"
2,Samantharae1,691,I am starting tomorrow with the cleansing. I have been having problems for about a year now and was talking to a lady at work who has the same problem. I am excited to start but nervous at the same time! That sounds like wonderful advise!
3,Terrylee5151,691,"I just used the egg whites from the eggs. If I was making my Hubs an omlet, I would take the egg whites and give him the yolks. I did not use lemon for 3 weeks. Some do and seem to heal okay anyway…. so it is probably up to you."

The grains are sunflower and pumpkin seeds. Do you think this kind of bread is appropriate? Could you share brands of breads that you are using? I also found a yeast-free, gluten-free millet bread, but I saw in the ingredients that they added grape syrup to it, for the taste.  I shouldn’t eat this bread, right? It’s so hard to find the right bread! What about morning cereals, do millet grits work? Thank you very much! Cécile"

3,Citizen123,692,"No “sprouted” grains! That is the worst thing for candida. You want to stay away from fermented things, and that would be one form. Use “brown rice flour” and make yourself some “Irish soda bread” without yeasts.

0,vegas,693,"Hi everyone, I apologize for the title, but this is my problem. It has lead to a pretty uncomfortable life in the last few months and has lead to other problems ‘down there’ too. My doctor just recently prescribed a topical antifungal soap and creme against yeast infection to help me through this particular episode. I also get bad night sweats if I drink red wine, which I have cut out completely, and have not had a night sweat in a long time. I have a tendency to be constipated and when I crave something, it is always carbohydrates (bread and crackers). The combination of these factors triggered me to explore the candida issue. I am just wondering if anyone else has experienced this type of itching and if the candida diet helped? My next step is to go to a naturopath, but any information on the anal problems would help me out. thanks!"
1,Eileen40,693,"Yes. I had a lot of itching. It got worse when I started the diet, then a rash spread to many places including ‘down there’. Anywhere skin touched skin and my limbs were affected, too. It was really bad, and I almost quit. After 2 1/2 weeks on nothing but salad, avocados, and a little meat, it dissipated! It was as if the sun rose and all the clouds blew away! I kept at it because others encouraged me to continue. I did not take any treatments other than the diet itself. Some others have tried herbal concoctions and such, but I’m convinced that strict adherence to the diet, with the drinking of plenty of water, ends the overgrowth faster. My skin has returned to normal and my depression has lifted. You can contact me by clicking on my name. The overgrowth started with a hospital stay that included a lot of powerful antibiotics, stress, and an overdose of chocolate."
2,PMGrey,693,"Hey, I don’t know if it applies to you, but rectal itching is a pretty strong sign you might have a parasite…  I just found out today that I have one and I started taking some supplements for it, along with the candida diet. Might be worth looking into though, I think it’s pretty common."
3,Samantharae1,693,"I have had some discomfort in that area and Occasional bleeding when I would go. I started this diet 3 days ago and have noticed a HUGE difference. I have an appointment for tomorrow morning to get it checked out anyways, so we will see. I will check back and post if I find anything of use out!"
4,Terrylee5151,693,"I agree with PMGrey, Anal itching is a sign of parasites…. I am just finishing up a parasite cleanse.

0,JLT,694,Does anyone know where I can find sugar free yogart? I am not going to make my own!

5,Terrylee5151,694,I don’t think there is a yogurt without any sugars. 6g is pretty good. The sugars come from the milk. Your yogurt sounds really yummy!! I buy Greek Gods Plain Yogurt and add Stevia and Carob powder…. MMMM…. tastes almost like ice cream.
0,miohare,695,I’m on my third day of the cleanse and I ended up in bed last night with a migraine. I started today alright but I’m only a few hours in and I’m headed in the same direction. I have hours before I can go to bed. Can I take something for it? Like excedrine migraine? Please I need help soon.
1,JLT,695,Sure you can! There is no reason to suffer. Again the cleanse is optional you can make it your own. And headache meds are not going to derail you.
2,whyitsme,695,"If you are taking fungicides, then they may be causing it. They were a problem for me, so we had to work to find a couple that my body could tolerate. Of course during the first month of the diet I had one a week, which was a result of the die-off/diet. Was amazing how much clearer my head would be after the headache as it killed off the candida."

0,Evurr,696,"Hi…. just wanted to share this Although I do have a bit of an overgrowth problem if I eat yeast extract most of my yeast infections seem to have come from unprotected sex with my husband (this is work in progress and not the topic for discussion here). I have given these Nelsons Candida tablets a go and found them really effective. I find my regime for treating a yeast infection takes about 5 days for me to stop itching. I took the first big dose yesterday and I am already much better than I would have been normally. I will add tho that I am aware of the signs a lot more now so act faster. I am taking 2 pau darco and 2 advanced acidophilus a day and when I get an attack I apply topically a mixture of organic cider vinager, water, lavender oil and geranium oil. I have a feeling that if it is an attack due to me eating badly the pau darco and acidopilus play a big role… but if it is an “external” attack only I wonder how effective they will be."
1,4evryoung,696,I’m using Hanna Kroeger’s Candida Kit while in stage one. I think it’s part of a milder approach to killing off overgrowth.
0,Evurr,697,"Just wanted to share a pondering that I thought might possibly help people. A few years ago I was getting every cold under the sun and was suffering from Seasonal Affective Dissorder. I started taking vitamin D3 for the SAD and found that it also boosts the immune system. No more colds for me. In fact the belter of a cold that is going around the UK at the moment showed it’s face and I felt like poo for 3 days and got better… everyone else seems to be down for 2 weeks. So, along side the dietary changes and other suppliments I wonder whether a general immune boosting vitamin would help others beat candida… worth a try. FYI I am taking 4000ui a day, I have read you can take up to 10,000 a day safely. Disclaimer.. I am not a doctor or a scientist so do your own research before taking this advice."
1,apctech,697,"Like you, I take 4000 IUs/day Vitamin D3 during the winter for SAD. I also take a daily multi-vitamin. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any improvement in the Candida symptoms with either one. But, it’s like you said, they seem to boost my overall immunity to colds and other illnesses."
2,Citizen123,697,"Don’t take any vitamins while trying to kill off candida. Multi-vitamins that contain, C, B’s, D’s all contribute to feeding the candida. Vitamins, such as the B-comples thiamine, niacin and riboflavin are usually yeast-grown! Just go without any while detoxing."
3,4evryoung,697,I’ve taken 10000mg of D3 for 2 years(year round.) My ND who suggested a Candida diet has never mentioned that the supplement would have a detrimental effect on my attempt to rid myself of Candida. I believe unnecessary supplements may interfere but in order for your body to function as designed and not hinder “die-off” you must have the proper nutrients(preferably natural.) I think it’s possible that my supplementation has kept me from having uncomfortable side-effects.
0,Tummy Blues,698,"So I’m on the fifth day of the Cleanse. I’ve chosen the 3rd option of taking the P & B Cleanse and eating raw salads and steamed veggies. I’m drinking tons of water and feel like I may get a UTI from all the trips to the bathroom, feeling really down and irritable, hungry and gas-y!! I’m embarrassed, confused and just want to stay in bed by myself. I took the complete Candida Questionnaire and scored 280, so I feel there’s a strong connection. But other than this site have little information to go on and doubts are surrounding me. I’d appreciate any advise in moving forward from our seasoned dieters. Thanks!"
1,HealMyGuts,698,"Hi! I have been on the Candida diet for about 2 and a half weeks now. I remember right at the beginning I was getting a lot of gas too. I think it has something to do with the die off. Another guess is that since the Candida blocks the regular digestion of the vegetables, it could be causing some type of irregular digestion side-effects. I have felt pretty hungry nearly the whole time I have been on this diet. I notice that every time I cheat a little(tiny bit of sugar or starches) I begin to get more hungry afterward. Remember that you can eat as much as you want on the Candida diet as long as you are eating Candida-safe foods. Sure many people will tell you that it is ideal to only have so much of this or so much of that, but I say go for it. If you listen to your body, and it is telling you that you need to eat more, then eat more. Things do get easier, and you will start to feel healthier. The Die-off stage can be tough because when the yeast dies it releases all it’s toxins at once into your intestines. This can cause some serious distress, but stick it out. Once you are well on your way into the diet, not only will you have more energy and vitality because of the food that you are eating, but you will feel great knowing that you are doing something truly good for yourself. To me, that is the biggest benefit of this diet. Good luck! -Tony"
2,Tummy Blues,698,Thanks for your encouragement! I’m starting to feel better and just bought this book The Candida Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook by Pat Connolly. It’s a great how-to guide! If you’re looking for some more information or yummy/healthy recipes I highly recommend it 🙂 Good luck!
0,JLT,699,"Ok so The main 2 reason I started this was because I have had a yeast infection for almost a year and was declared gluten intolerent last spring. So I have followed the diet exactly even started with the cleanse. And I feel fantastic my energy is through the roof. I can’t stop working out I can’t cleaning my house. I can’t stop talking for christ sakes. But sadly I also can’t shake this yeast infection. As a matter of fact its gotten worse. I am doing the coconut oil , coconut milk, oregeno tea, garlic, pumpkin seeds, apple cidar vinegar and Diflucan. Nothing is working. Can someone please advise? Am I just in “die-off” Should I see yet another doctor? Please anything ………"
1,apctech,699,"Just hang in there. Candida is tenacious and pervasive; therefore, you’re in for a long, hard fight. It isn’t like a bacterial infection where you take antibiotics and, poof! It’s gone. I’ve been taking probiotics, coconut oil, raw coconut, cinnamon, ginger, etc…for two years now and I’m still have symptoms of Candidiasis. In fact, I know the Candida will never ever completely go away. I just need to get to the point where the Candida isn’t running rampant throughout my body and I think it’s getting there because the symptoms are subsiding. It sounds as if you’re on the right track too."
2,kelandu,699,"hi , you say you feel worse? you are doing the right thing bnut i reckon you are experiencing the die off, it is awful but please stick with it. It will pass within a couple of weeks. dont give up! x"
3,JLT,699,Thanks! I have been putting tea tree oil on tampons and wearing them during the day. It really helps!
4,HealMyGuts,699,"Hello! Have you tried Grapefruit Seed Extract? I find that GSE is one of THE BEST natural anti-fungals out there. I have tried ACV, Coconut oil, Tea tree oil, Olive oil, and probably a couple snake oils. None of them have done anything for me as far as anti-fungals go. GSE on the other hand has shown me excellent results. I generally drink some Water with GSE every day, most times 2x a day. I fill up a water bottle and add about 20 drops, or sometimes I fill it half way and add 15 drops for a stronger concentration. It tastes bad, but it kills Candida so it’s worth it. I have also had VERY good results using it as a topical wash. I just get my hand wet then I put 5-7 drops on my hand while it is still wet and apply that to the affected area. You would have to do some research to figure out the best practical way to use it for a yeast infection. Remember also that it is important to rotate anti-fungals. If you use the same thing for too long, it is possible that the Candida will mutate into a strain that is resistant to the anti-fungal that you are using. Good luck, and don’t give up!"
0,JLT,700,"So I always knew that you need to keep your probiotics in the fridge. What I did not know is that not all companies guarantee that thier product is alive at exiration. Meaning that if at some point in the delivery process or packaging process they are left to get warm, then thats it they are dead. Now why would someone sell dead probiotics is what you’re thinking?. Well its not bad for you to them, they will feed the “good” bugs you already have and keep them going. Provided you have any left. If you need to REPLENISH your good flora you need to read the package for this guarantee. This has been my problem I think. Because I have been taking 2 at 3.4 billion a piece for weeks with no improvment and mine were left out during a move and got warm."
1,kelandu,700,"Its amazing what we find out isnt it? I dont feel better after taking probiotics either, maybe this is the case? thanks for pointing it out."

0,mela14,701,"I have been dealing with Candida for years! I also have CFS/Fibro and interstitial Cystitis. I have lots of food intolerances and terrible allergies. I was doing a little better for a while and started eating cookies, cakes, pasta and pizza! Things got worse so I went back to basics. I started treatment in a new Integrative Facility. Anyway, it’s been about a month and I have stuck to their diet…which means so sugars and white starches. I have started eating brown rice and seem to be doing ok with digesting it but I think it is feeding the Candida! I am not sure what to do. My stool results did not show Candida. It showed poor digestions of meats and vegetables. After being on the diet a month the Dr. had me do an Ultra Clear detox and I got sick from the first dose! I was also given some supplements that made me totally sick! I know I have some food allergies so we are going to test for that now. I know the Candida is worse because it shows in my fingernails and I can’t get the Vaginal yeast under control! Do I need to take matters into my own hands and make the diet even more strict? I’ve doubled my probiotics to 2 capsules of 30 billion organisms. how high should I be going? He does not have me on any anti-fungals. I started myself on a low dose of grapefruit seed extract. I am so disgusted becasue nothing seems to be working and my gut is in terrible shape!"
1,whyitsme,701,"When I was allergy tested using the NAET method with my naturopath we found out my body doesn’t like proteins like meats either, but is okay if I take a digestive enzyme (HCL)with the meal. Body not being able to digest food is a cause of candida overgrowth sicne it stresses the body, and may be one of your causes. You can pick it up at a supplement store or naturopath office. You may also want to try other digestive enzymes if you also have trouble with vegetables. Of course for me it took awhile to get in the habit of taking with food (still forget once in awhile). So on top of ridding body of candida, we must correct the situation that caused it as well, in order to keep healthy enough to heal."
2,mela14,701,"Thanks for the response. Coincidentally, I picked up a multi enzyme yesterday and tested it with my meals even before I read this reply. I think I was able to tolerate it ok. I only took half of it with lunch and then the other half with dinner. I have to be very careful with new supplements as I have so many intolerances! Anyway, I’m going baack to the store to buy a bottle so I can take them regularly. I had only gotten a sample packet to try. It’s got lots of enzymes in it but I noticed that it does not have betain hydrochloride. I am considering adding that separately as I feel I am probably low and it would benefit my digestion. I just came from the doctor and they took 4 tubes of blood to test for delayed food intolerances. I had this done about 6 years ago and it helped to know what I was reacting too. Of course things change and I h ave a new doctor so I am curious to see what is going on. I get pretty sick after eating certain foods and am not sure if it’s because I am not breaking them down or because I have an intolerance.  Thanks for the reply. Hope you are doing well."
0,granolagirl86,702,"I just started the candida diet about 4 days ago, and I feel like I am not getting all the nutrition my body needs. I am an active 24 year old. I wanted to try using the Vega Whole Food Optimizer protein powder (http://myvega.com/products/whole-food-health-optimizer/features-benefits)but am worried that it will hinder killing off all the yeast in my body. It contains no sugar, yeast, etc, but being that it is powdered makes me wonder if something in it may disrupt my diet and the caprylex I am taking. Are any of you on any supplements while you are doing this diet, or are you getting enough from your food? If so, what are you eating to get enough?!? Thanks!"
1,Tpug,702,"Hi granolagirl86, I also have only been doing this for about 4 days, but I am doing a mix of the cleanse and the stage 1 diet (more cleanse side). I focus more on the body ecology diet but they can be similar. I am not going to take any supplements during this time frame but I will reintroduce them when I start up purely stage 1, just in case there was any supplement I was taking that was bothering my system or Candida. The cleanse and the foods from stage 1 that I have been eating seem to be supplying me with whatever I need for now without added supplements. I will also start adding probiotics and some anti-fungal supplements down the road as well, but until my system is ready for re-population it will have to wait. I don’t think adding your Vega Whole Food Optimizer will disrupt the diet, especially if you are in stage 1 and not doing the cleanse. Though my suggestion would be try 4-7 days without supplements on the diet and than add the powder and pay close attention to what changes, good or bad. Stick with it! -T"

I suppose none is the safest cause. I have just added a small amount to yogurt and berries, after 8 weeks on diet. Just tired of eating the same foods, so since berries, yogurt and oats are on some lists I thought I’d add it back about 3-4 times a week. (only about 1/4 cup of oats per serving) however I don’t want to negatively reverse the good I have done. Advice?"
1,Eileen40,703,"If you don’t have a gluten intolerance, could you try it? Does one wrong food destroy weeks of work? How sensitive is this diet to minor infractions? Some diets have wiggle room while others could crash and burn with a single meal. I wish I could help. If it were me, I’d forget the oats, but you may be able to handle it."
2,JLT,703,Bob’s Mill make a great gluten free outmeal. The truth is oats are gluten free but most factories use flour in the rolling process. Also alot of oats are grown all mixed in with where wheat is being grown. So you must go to the health food store (I am seeing it more and more in mainstrean grocers) and buy gluten free oats.

I’m putting myself on the dietand trying to stick with it, but it’s only day 2 of my cleanse and im STARVING!(It was a lot easier when i was 9 and had no other option but to eat what my parents provided) I SO want to be able to eat something other than a raw veggie or broth soup! Not sure how to deal with a whole week of this?? Not to mention, I was a smoker, so as of Saturday night, i also quit smoking. My whole body is going through withdrawls.. from smoking and from not feeding the candida (I woke up this morning itching all over and feeling horrible 🙁 ANY TIPS on how to make this week easier would be greatly appreciated by me, AND my poor boyfriend who has to deal with an emotional and physical wreck right now…"
1,JLT,704,I am on day 3 of the cleanse and I have been eating something small at night and I mean real small a grilled chicken breast plain. It really helps me get through without wrecking the whole thing. Remember the cleanse is optional you can just go straight into Stage One. But if you are able to do most of the cleanse like I am I suggest you stay with it. I know its awful but its for the greater good. By the way I also did a practice week( the few days between Christmas and New Years)so I knew what to expect this week and it has really helped with the panic.
2,Eileen40,704,"Try eating 200 calories every 3 hours, and drink lots of water. I know what the hunger is like, but it should get better after 3 or 4 days."
3,Tpug,704,"Hi Playtime, I am only on day 4 but kind of going through the same “hungry” withdrawals. I know you are doing the pure cleanse but like JLT said you can go straight to Stage1. I have just been adding little things from Stage1 to help me cope with the cleanse i.e. eating some grains/veggies/eggs. Just small amounts during the cleanse to take the edge off. I think this is better than suffering and will help you stick with the diet in the long run. Also, the feeling hungry can be caused by your body not being bloated. Your diet before might have made you bloated and now that you are introducing foods that do not cause the bloating you have the tendency to feel more “hungry.” I have never really craved sugar but now on this diet my body is begging for it, so I found that making some ginger tea and adding some stevia is a great calmer. I use raw ginger, peel it, slice it up and add it to about 4 cups of boiling water for about 15-20mins. Move it to a cool burner and let it sit there for 30mins or more and it will get more a more intense ginger taste (you can play with how much water/ginger to make it how you want). Than add some stevia, it helps a ton with the cravings (I had a dream of eating a huge chocolate chip cookie the other nite!). As for the smoking withdrawals…not sure what to help with on that side. Stick with it and it sounds like you are already having Die-off which is a great sign! -T"
0,Thisquietone,705,"Hello all, It seems a silly question but with different diets and many of them not being safe of not getting enough vitamins and minerals calcium etc? Also I wondered being on a candida diet is it wheat, gluten and dairy free? Iv got a slight allergy to all of thoses 🙁 How do you lot cope? Iv seen a quick list of the foods we should eat and I guess by looking at it Iv got to start being well prepared to be on an ongoing candida diet 🙁"
1,Eileen40,705,"This diet seems to dovetail nicely with the GFCF diet I need to use. It’s a bit more restrictive, and some of the things I do to have bread while avoiding gluten have to be suspended for the first three weeks. The first part of this diet really demands the suspension of any type of bread."
2,Evurr,705,"this is just my opinion, based only on my experience and my own personal issues. But… I have found that cutting out the real no-no foods and combining them with pau darco and acidopilus has been enough. I don’t have a major overgrowth issue but have found that if I eat marmite (yeast extract) I get an infection. It took a while but until recently I hadn’t had a yeast infection in over a month. Personally I would do your research. Read all the diets and see what the comonalities are and start there. I cut out almost all yeast (inc mushrooms), almost all sugar and vinager (apart from cider vinager), added the anti-fungals and that was enough. But, as I say I don’t have a major problem. I don’t eat meat so I had to change the diet for my own purposes on the basis that the diet relies on people eating large quantites of meat."
0,thief27,706,"I am suffering from candida…where to begin? chronic fatigue syndrome? dermatitis? itchy scalp? headaches? you name it i’ve got it. I tried the diet almost 4 years ago and was given exmykehl,quentakehl,nigersan and mucokehl. These medicines were great in that for two weeks i could feel the candida being killed…i actually felt worse than ever at first…but then i started to feel better. unfortunately i just didn;t have the discipline to continue the treatment or follow the diet. I recently bought these homeopathic remedies to start treatment again..but i don;t rmember in which order or which one is supposed to be used first…can anyoe here help me please??? i could call the practitioner from 4 years ago but she will probably want me to pay and it’s quite expensive. thanks!"
1,discodiver,706,"Take it from someone who has been fighting this candida problem for quite some time. Be carefull when purchasing anything on the internet claiming to cure candida. I’ve have actually spent thousands of dollars on so called “cures” all of which have done NOTHING for me. The one item that I do think helped me to some degree was a product called Fungal Defense. After two days I certainly felt the die-off symptoms so I knew it was working. The problem with most of these “cures” are they will not compeltely rid you of this fungus. A combination of suppliments and diet is what will eventually cure you. ABSOLUTELY no sugar, yeast or gluten foods for at least 30 days. A small price to pay in order to regain your health. For me…today is day 2 of NO SUGAR and I can certainly feel the difference. The brain fog is starting to lift to a small degree but I do have all the other problems. The candida diet is very plain and boring but if you can muster the will power this will save you a lot of money. Run away from any products that claim you can maintain your original diet while taking their “cure.” IT WONT WORK! Good luck to you."
0,Bunny,707,"Hi, I’ve done all my research and I’m now pretty much convinced I have a candida overgrowth problem.  For a few year years now I’m chronically fatigued, have terrible constipation, and get skin rashes. I notice my symptoms get really bad when I drink alcohol or consume junk food like pizza, cakes, and chocolate. I’m wondering if I just cut out the junk strictly, do I really have to go and buy all these anti-fungals and supplements which I really can’t afford?  Can I get rid of the candida by diet only? Would appreciate any advice.. Thanks!"
1,Mia,707,"The diet will keep the candida under control somewhat but once you give in and eat junk it will come back. I would say at the very least get the following. Both natural effective anti-fungals. Organic virgin coconut oil..take 2 tablespoons a day with food.  Fresh garlic every evening after dinner..mix 2 to 3 cloves with a large glass of water. If you can do the cleanse with psyllium husk and bentonite clay as well. Oh and try applying Organic, raw, unpasturized ACV on your skin rash. Mix 50/50 and apply or add a cup to your bath. It should help!"
2,stana,707,"Mia wrote: If you can do the cleanse with psyllium husk and bentonite clay as well. Hello, Do you suggest to use the tablet or powder form of Psyllium husk and bentonite? Thanks, Stana"
3,whyitsme,707,"I have had alot of food alergies/congestion from candida. Therefore if you have similar problems, I would suggest checking with a naturopath before starting antifungals. My body couldn’t handle a couple of them, and gave me killer headaches due to allergic reaction. After that she allergy tested me (kinetic) how my body would react to it, so was able to find a couple anti-fungals that would work for me. Still got a couple killer headaches about once a week during first month, but think that was more with die-off, since head always felt a little bit clearer afterwards."

1,Guest,708,Detox (Total Body Rapid Cleanse) + Candida diet + Candex + probiotic (Ultimate Flora Vaginal Support) worked for me. It probably took around 3 weeks to see the full effect (of it clearing up) and I have had vaginal yeast issues for over 10 years. I am now trying to find a balance in the foods I eat and I am still taking Candex (1-2/day instead of 4) and probiotic (1/day) as maintenance.
2,Ninni,708,I tried doing the diet but didn’t have the willpower to follow it strictly. I was pretty skeptical about Fivelac but decided to give it a go. Can’t believe how much better I feel. My foggy head and fatigue that I’ve had for years is pretty much gone now after a week!
3,Guest,708,"I am having very hard time to give up on sweets, I any tips would be appreciated, Thanks, Rose"
4,Alex,708,"Fortunately and regardless of what many dermatologists and other western medicine followers would want you to believe- All forms of yeast infection CAN be cured, permanently, holistically and using pure natural means. There is absolutely no need for antibiotics, Threelac, tinctures, Cellfood Oxygen, tonics, or using any harsh unnatural chemical treatments which never address the internal cause of yeast infection and can also be quite hazardous, pricey and can sometimes lead to irreversible results. Yeast infection is first of all, a sign of disease. Yeast infection occurs when your body is trying to communicate with you. To send you a message that something is wrong inside and should be corrected. In order to bring the body back into natural balance, you need to: 1.Eliminate the ‘on the surface’ symptoms. 2.Make specific dietary changes and optimize digestion. 3.Strengthen your immune system and provide your body with the nutritional force it needs to heal itself. 4.Detox and cleanse your system. 5.Alkalize your system and take specific supplements in a specific order and rotation that kill the Candida infection and spores. 6.Restore the natural bacterial balance in your bowels. 7.Eliminate the environmental Candida triggers and maintain the results. Just like a combination on a lock, any one piece applied alone will not cure your Candida infection in most cases. It is how all the pieces work together that is crucial. _________________________________________________________________________________ For the holistic, step by step guide that many women have used to permanently get rid of their yeast infections naturally, please visit: cureyouryeastinfection . net"
5,Jenni8,708,"My first full day on my candida diet is almost finished. I still crave sweets but it’s mostly visual. When I open the fridge I see all kinds of stuff I can’t eat or drink since my husband refuses to go on my same diet. Earlier I had a spell of being completely exhausted and even took an hour nap. The only thing I have noticed was after I had my lunch my stomach was feeling different but not in a bad way. Also when I got home from work I wasn’t feeling starved as I usually do. I’m too thin and underweight but I’ve developed my own method after tons of research. I’m blending my detox and diet. I’ve used epsom salts in a bath last night and will do this every night for at least a week or two. I’ve begun eating garlic cloves cut in half raw. (whole is supposed to be better, but I can’t swallow it that big.) In addition I am taking some anti-fungal pills. I had been wondering when I need to bring in probiotics. I think after I go through my die-off period and begin to feel better is when I’ll bring in them in. To prevent myself from losing any weight, I’m eating nuts and hard boiled eggs in addition to all the veggies. The eggs make a great breakfast in the morning to already have ready to go. (I get up really early so It’s hard to eat at home, so I take my breakfast with me to have on my first break, when it’s still quite early.) Anyone have any other on the go foods to eat in the morning? Tonight my dinner was sauteed green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, green peppers, fresh garlic, black pepper in extra virgin olive oil with sunflower seeds sprinkled on when served. It was very tasty. My husband said it tasted like butter was on it, but better. ;D Olive oil is my new best friend."

0,shashi,710,I have tried and failed in a long term support to keep Candida away. Cleaning out and then relapsing has been ongoing but i am determined to keep it away. Anyone knows about and has tried the Body Ecology Diet and such? Thanks in advance.
0,etm5,711,"I wondered why I can’t take antifungals during phase 1? Or can I? Also, I had started a product called yeast redux, and have continued it since I started this. Is that ok? I want to rid my body fast, and am ok with the die off…and yes I am experiencing that!"
0,Evurr,712,Just wanted to share my treatment for vaginal yeast infection. Tea tree is amazing stuff. A couple of drops in water and wash with it and it will sooth the itching. I take a bottle with some in it and some cotton wool to work and every time I nip to the loo for a pee I have a quick freshen up. Feels lovely and cooling.
