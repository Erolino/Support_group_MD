0,Will,1,"So, I posted on here a few years back about how I had a ton of issues. Throughout my life I’ve had the following issues:– re-occurring ear infections, treated with uncountable antibiotic prescriptions – thrush – allergies – eczema – asthma – burning mouth syndrome – prostatitis – sebaccious cysts (have to have them surgically removed) – cystic acne (back acne) – lipomas – chronic fatigue – fibromyalgia – anxiety – depression – brain fog – loss of memory – acid reflux/gerd (nissen fundoplication wrap done in 2007) – IBS and chronic flatulence – beer gut (even without drinking alcohol)I’m sure I missed a few things in the list, but you get the idea. Life has been HELL, for as long as I can remember.From age 15-27, I partied very hard. However, I was always physically active, as I am a skateboarder.A few years ago I attempted to clean up my diet but could not afford it at the time.My protocol to healing started in January 2018. The doctors had me on prescription drugs for my anxiety and depression. I lost all muscle mass and all my other physical symptoms got 100% worse. I finally decided I was tired of feeling like crap. I kicked all the medication and cleaned up my diet.The first 3 months was by far the hardest thing I have ever done. I ate a strict diet for the first 2 months. Water, Vegan protein mixed with Almond milk, and Subway chopped chicken salads (no dairy added, only leafy greens and approved Candida foods). I literally lived off of these salads for 2 months. I went from 191lbs down to 165lbs by the end of March and going into April. I looked horrible, but was slowly starting to feel my insides cleaning out.I got a gym membership in February and started going 1-2 times per week, light weight lifting (literally, 5 and 10lb dumb bell exercises) and basic body weight exercises. (mind you, I was still going through die off and felt like death the entire time). I could barely do 15 push ups and could only run 0.15 of a mile. I never gave up.Up until the beginning of this month (April), I wasn’t eating enough calories and I could really feel it taking a toll on me. I decided to open my diet back up and bump those calories.In the beginning of April, I learned to count calories and did more research on nutrition. At 165lbs, my target goal was 172lbs (this is with going to the gyn every day, mon-fri). I bumped my calories up to 2600, rather than 1200-1800 like I had been on during my “cleanse” state . ( I do not recommend anyone cutting calories this low. I did it in moderation and I paid very close attention to my body. )Now, here I am, middle of April, and I feel 100% better. Improvements listed below:– re-occurring ear infections, treated with uncountable antibiotic prescriptions (these have been gone since my surgery on my ear in 2015) – thrush (HEALED) – allergies – burning/itchy eye, dry nose(HEALED) – eczema – eczema on legs (HEALED) – skin looking/feeling soft. minor flare ups when working out, but goes back to normal once I’m at home and showered/rested – asthma – HEALED – never in my life have I been able to run 1 mile.. I can now run 2 miles. – burning mouth syndrome – HEALED – doctors could not explain this but I knew it was my diet – prostatitis – PROGRESSING – the urge to urinate is slowly getting better – sebaccious cysts (have to have them surgically removed) – these, I dont feel are going to be able to be healed, however, I believe the diet can prevent new ones from forming – cystic acne (back acne) – PROGRESSING – my back skin now feels soft and smooth. alot of scarring but the acne bumps are slowly getting flatter – lipomas – I dont feel these will be able to be healed either. my grandma and uncle both have this issue. im gonna say genetics…. – chronic fatigue – HEALED – I have more energy than ever, its unreal. – fibromyalgia – PROGRESSING – obviously working out causes some aching/pains, however, at least the small ache/pains i feel now, I actually have something to attirebute them to, rather than not having any reason at all. – anxiety – HEALED – well this was just all the gases in my gut floating around – depression – HEALED – same as anxiety… just too much gases built up in the colon – brain fog – HEALED – same as anxiety/depression – loss of memory – PROGRESSING – I am becoming less and less forgetful – acid reflux/gerd (nissen fundoplication wrap done in 2007) – PROGRESSING – still some minor discomfort in the upper abdominal region but i feel it slowly diminishing over the weeks – IBS and chronic flatulence – flatulence is getting better , however, I eat alot of brocolli so it flares up when I eat this – beer gut (even without drinking alcohol) – HEALED – I have a mean six pack now… its crazy..I’m sure you’re wondering, what is your current protocol? Here is my daily routine:Breakfast:– 7 egg whites – 1 egg – 1 full cup of organic oats mixed with strawberries/blueberries – one scoop of vegan protein powder (15g of protein) – 1 smoothie (usually 1 banana, strawberries, and more blueberries or black berries, 1 teaspoon of flax seed, and a super food powder pack from Walmart (i forget the name of it))Morning snack:– diced melons (watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, etc) – Larabar (cashew cookie or coconut)Lunch– 226g of antibiotic free chicken , seasoned with garlic, onions, salt, pepper, and oregano – 150g of sweet potatos – 156g of broccoliEnd of work day:– another smoothie . same as the breakfast smoothie – 1 RX bar (blueberry preferred)After workout:– 2 scoops of protein powder mixed with Almond milk – 226g of antibiotic free chicken , seasoned with garlic, onions, salt, pepper, and oregano – 150g of sweet potatos – 156g of broccoliSnacks:– handful of cashews or peanuts (yep thats it)Supplements:– RenewLife probiotics ( started with 20 billion, and built up to 90billion) – Vitamin C – B12 – Organic/vegan multi vitamin – Aloe vera – Omegas – Spirulina – RenewLife IntestiNEWThe protein powder has L Glutamine in it as well, so that also helps. In regards to antifungal, I eat garlic with everything. And for fats, I use olive oil and coconut oil to cook my food.Now, I know some of you are going to say “omg all those fruits and sweet potatoes?” I’ll start by saying, every person is different. Nonetheless, your body thrives on the anxioxidents and fiber provided by those fruits. It has not affected my recovery at all. (You can find a very popular youtuber who healed his body/eczema while consuming high amounts of fruits)I also switch out the broccoli some days for asparagus or some other type of green ( green beans, etc ).I did alot of research on bodybuilding and took their diet and adjusted it to be Candida friendly (for me). I am now back up to 172lbs. I am getting compliments from everyone on how my skin looks great and how my body is changing and now looking athletic again. I feel like I am getting my old life back and plus more. My physique looks absolutely incredible compared to 3 monthds ago.My advice to everyone, learn to count your calories and learn how to do a 40/30/30 split (40% protein, 30% carbs, and 30% fats). This is the general macro breakdown that most people should follow. I am currently on a 45/35/25 split as I am building muscle in the gym.I am no where near close to being healed 100%. However, I know if I keep with the protocol I’m on, I can continue to feel better and continue to heal.Good luck to all, and I hope this advice helps."
1,Will,1,"I know there hasn’t been any replies, however, I wanted to post an update.Im going on my 5th month of diet and exercise and each day is getting better.The itching all over went away within the first 2-3 months. I forgot to mention this previously.The cystic acne on my back is almost 100% healed (lots of scars though). I’ve been using Vitamin E oil to help reduce the redness of the scars. My back is feeling nice and smooth again like baby’s skin. Previously, I could do dry skin brushing and would have flakes of black toxin residue all on my fingers. This is no longer the case. I can do dry skin brushing and there is no more residue.Lipomas are a bit softer than usual. I just ordered out for daily liver supplements to help with this.The beer gut is still normal. No more bloating. I do still have flatulence, but I’m sure its from the broccoli and asparagus I eat. When I eat green beans instead, the gas seems to not be present.Bowel movements are 2-3 times per day which is excellent.Anxiety/Depression is still at bay. I have occasional flare ups of anxiety, but I know its just my body’s natural way of telling me I’m toxic and when I feel like this, I just drink a lot of water and it goes away.Hay fever is still at bay as well. My ears turn bright red every once in a while when my anxiety flares and I get mild hay fever. Again, I just drink a lot of water.Fibromyalgia is hardly noticeable anymore. Exercise seems to actually help.The burning sensation in my chest seems to be slowly getting better and is almost hardly noticeable.The eczema seems to flare every so often, but the itchyness is no longer present. The rash is just red and doesn’t really bother me. Hopefully the liver support will help.My eye allergies seem to flare up occasionally but are getting better each day. The pain seems to be minimal most days. I also noticed the black rings and bags around my eyes are almost gone.The prostate issue also seems to be clearing up. I don’t have hardly any pain in my bowels anymore and the urge to urinate seems to be normal.I had to cut out eggs as it seems I am intolerant of them. The only animal product in my diet is antibiotic free chicken. Everything else is fruits/vegetables. My tongue is still nice and pink.Overall, it seems my body is slowly adjusting and going back to “normal” . I believe once I add the liver detox supplements it will speed up recovery.When I skip going to the gym, I can definitely feel a difference. I feel exercise is important because it helps with cell regeneration. If you’re not exercising, you’re not healing properly.Good luck!"
2,Will,1,"I forgot to mention, chemical sensitivity has drastically decreased. When I first started my protocol in January, I couldn’t bare to be around any kind of chemical. This includes fire smoke, fragrances, I was even becoming intolerant to my own deodorant.When I walk outside into the fresh air, I can now smell the earth again and I can now bare to wear a small amount of cologne.I am 100% sure my body is healing and I have no plan to go back to my old habits.At the rate my body is healing, I am going to say I should be “healed” and living healthy again within 2 years.The only two things I do not think I will be able to heal are the lipomas and cysts. However.. I do have some ideas for topical treatment. Since I am constantly detoxing and cleansing from the inside, I believe if I attack the lipomas and cysts from the outside then my body will heal on the inside and prevent further ones from forming."
3,Tubrik,1,"Amazing story, Will, 80% symptoms similar to mine. When felt better and I started to eat bananas and some other food like you again and everything was fine for the first month. I returned to sports, my weight began gaining back and I was happy. But then all returned back within one week."
4,gotshot26,1,Thanks for the post. Gives me hope.
5,Will,1,"UPDATE:Things still seem to be going well. I have noticed though that my eyes are constantly red and yellow which suggest my liver and gallbladder are congested.I am having 2-3 bowel movements per day which means I am ready to flush the liver and gallbladder.When I was 17, I had issues with vomiting bile and terrible acid reflux. I also remember passing a gallbladder stone (at the time I did not know what it was and it scared the shi* out of me).I went to the hospital the other night and had a panel done on my liver and pancreas as my mother recommended me to do so. All blood tests were normal.So, I read online that liver and gallbladder congestion can cause the yellowing of the eyes and allergies in general.I ordered the following book: The Liver and Gallbladder Miracle Cleanse: An All-Natural, At-Home Flush to Purify and Rejuvenate Your Body from AmazonI had planned on doing a parasite cleanse this week, however, I do not think my liver and gallbladder can handle any more cleansing so I will be doing the above flush before I do any more cleansing for parasites.I plan on doing the liver/gallbladder flush over the next month or so and have decided to hold off on the parasite cleanse until I can clear up some of this congestion.Any advice from someone who has done these kind of flushes before would be much appreciated.In regards to Candida, my tongue is still bright pink. My eczema on my leg is still under control (sometimes the skin is light red, but no itching anymore).The red/yellow eyes are whats concerning to me and I’m hoping that this flush will help clear it up.My stomach is still flat and my flatulence has continued to decrease. It is no where near as bad as it was 5 months ago. (it was so bad I couldn’t even sit beside anyone at work because I was constantly passing gas).Good luck!"
6,Will,1,"UPDATE:I’m still feeling okay for the most part. Occasional hay fever. My progress is still moving along at a slow rate. I’ve decided to try a water fast instead of the liver flush previously mentioned. Mainly because I do not want to ingest epsom salts.I plan on trying a 3-4 day water fast following up with a 2-3 smoothie/juice fast.I have been reading about the benefits of water fasting in regards to helping the liver cleanse the blood. You can refer to the following URL: http://starthealthylife.com/page266.htmBasically, it states that when we digest food, the liver is unable to cleanse the toxins in our blood, even when eating a healthy diet as I have been.Water fasting allows for maximum filtration of your blood by the liver and gallbladder. Since the issue is that I have spent many years abusing my body and ingesting toxic food, it only makes sense to give digestion a break and focus on detoxing again.My goal of the fast is to try and get rid of the itchy eyes I’ve had for the past few months. I will report back with results."
7,Will,1,"UPDATE:After being so fed up with my eye problems, I decided to visit urgent care again. My mom said she smelled infection on my breath.Over the last year I’ve lost my sense of smell and this past week my eyes swelled shut. I kept thinking my yellow eye tint was from liver problems from drug abuse, however, it turns out that I’ve had a silent chronic sinus infection (bacterial) for over a year.I had been treating my sinus issues as allergies, however, that seems to not be the case. I am currently having to take Augmentin and Prednisone. While I obviously don’t approve of using these medicines, I have to take them.After being on them for only 24 hours, I’m pulling some of the nastiest shi* out of my sinus cavity. I hocked up mucous from my nose and spit it out and it was pure green. Absolutely horrible.I’ve doubled up on my probiotics while I take antibiotics and my tongue is still bright pink so far. The lingering digestive issues are also clearing up. Seems like the infection has been draining into my intestines causing issues.A little background on sinus issues is that I used to snort drugs about a year and a half ago while I was addicted to opiates. I have been drug free for over a year. Hence why I am 100% this infection is bacterial and it makes sense why the diet and Candida treatment has helped all of my other issues except this.I have seen multiple doctors in the past year to try and figure out why I hadn’t been feeling “normal” and I now have hopes that this silent sinusitis has been making me extremely sick.I also had to get antibiotic eye drops from where the infection has spread into my eyes which has been causing the yellow tint. Growing up, even with ear problems and other issues, I always had pearl white eyes until recently. I hope to god this clears all of this up.I plan on going to get a neti pot and sinus irrigation kit after work.I will report back in 10 days."
8,Will,1,"UPDATE:Im on day 10 of antibiotics. My sinus infection has cleared and it seems that my IBS and prostate/bowel pain is also clearing up.I suspect I’ve had a chronic bacterial prostate infection as well that has put a halt to my overall healing.I’m more than likely going to be on antibiotics for 1-2 months. However, as soon as I’m done with the antibiotics, I plan on doing a candida/parasite cleanse. I’m taking RenewLife 90 billion – probiotic capsules 2-3 times a day. Bowel movements are 2-3 times a day. Tongue is still pink. My appetite has sky rocketed. I literally want to eat everything I see.The remaining “eczema” rash on my legs seems to be 100% clear. I suspect this was a result of toxins from the bacterial infections.I have even introduced foods back into my diet to test for reactions and so far, I do not appear to be having any kind of immediate allergies. I’m thinking the diet and supplements I’ve been on for the past 6 months have done some work on my intestines and has helped heal the small/large intestines. Now I just gotta get these bowels cleaned out. I have an enema kit and I was thinking of starting them once I am off of the antibiotic treatment. (I don’t wanna go flushing bacteria up into my colon, so it’s probably best to just wait).The yellow eyes are slowly clearing up as well. I suspect the yellow eyes is just a result of toxins from the bacterial infections that Ive had for the past few months.I’ve also stopped all vitamins until my eyes are 100% clear just to be sure the eye color change is not from some type of vitamin overdose or detox reaction.All my blood panels are normal so I’m hoping once the two bacterial infections are clear my body will be able to finish healing and I’ll be back to feeling “normal” .My family doctor wants me to get screened for Hepatitis and STDs for the yellow eyes. I had a prostate infection a few years back that took 1-2 months to clear up and when I had that infection my lips swelled up. This time around it seems my eyes swelled shut. Either way, I seem to be doing 100% better in regards to the remaining ailments I’ve had these past few months. The “allergies” doctors kept saying I had are finally going away. Again, I believe my immune system has been in a hyperactive state for months because of the chronic bacterial infections.My advice is to pay attention to your body. I had been writing off my prostate issues as having an enlarged prostate, but I’m pretty sure I’ve been walking around with a bacterial infection for quite some time that has been making me feel ill. Luckily, when I finally decided to get treatment for the sinus infection, I noticed my IBS and prostate issues started clearing up as well.These past few months have been a hell of a rollercoaster and I’m learning new information everyday."
9,Will,1,"Oh yeah… I forgot to mention. I received a sheet of paper from the urgent care about yeast overgrowth in your mouth and intestines.Basically, it said to take probiotics while taking antibiotics and to keep taking them for 1-2 months after. I may even find the sheet and upload it for you all to see.The ENT I seen also told me to make sure I am taking probiotics.It seems the doctors around here are starting to catch on to the dangers of antibiotic use and yeast problems. I found it very interesting."
10,LiamSmith,1,Thank you for youre post. Found a lot usefull stuff there. Good luck with ure plans! Lets be all healthy and strong
11,RiversTrini,1,Good luck. Keep up your routine. The story is real. Dedication is the key to kicking Candida. I am going on my 14 month. It has been a struggle.
12,son_of_sun,1,"Thanks for sharing your story. I’ve been very curious about what a candida diet plan for a weightlifter would look like, specifically on best strategy to gain calories/mass and supplement intake. Are you aware of any scientific studies that exist based around this same topic? Taking in a high amount of carbs is frowned upon on this diet but I’d like to further understand the correlation between carb value and rigorous exercise output.As for pre-workout supplements, do you take any currently that are deemed ‘safe’ for the candida diet? Caffeine is something I would like to include but everything that I’ve read says to avoid it at first.Please share your updates on doctor’s visit, hope you’re recovering well."
13,Will,1,"I would not recommend any pre-workout supplements. The diet I’ve outlined above seems to be the cleanest route to go. Food should be enough to get you lean/bulked up. Just eat a ton of chicken. Like I said before, learn how to do a macro split and try the 45/35/25 split (45% protein, 35% carbs and 25% fats). Candida thrives on unhealthy carbs. If you’re eating healthy carbs, you’ll be fine.You can see my 3 month progress photo at http://xnizstudio.com/xniz.JPG . Before I started I was 200lbs and had no muscle and just a beer gut. Right now im out of the gym and fell off my diet so I’ve lost alot of my gains. I’m not quite 200lbs, but I went from 172 back up to 178-180ish.The reason is that, I’ve been seeing an ENT for my sinus issues. Apparently, the drugs I sniffed a few years ago caused some issues with my frontal sinuses. They are swollen shut and can’t drain properly based on the CT scan I had done.I’m waiting for confirmation on whether or not I’m going to have balloon sinuplasty to open them back up and have them drained/cleaned. Antibiotics aren’t working (obviously, my sinuses haven’t drained properly in 2 years).So.. if I can ever get my sinuses fixed up, I’ll be back to the gym and back on the protocol I listed above.Right now, I’m eating mostly chicken whenever I eat take out food and white rice. Either way, I’m hoping they can fix my sinuses because it feels like someone punched me in the face and my eyes keep swelling shut whenever I try to exercise.Good luck!"
14,Tubrik,1,"Will, do you mean that you cured the infection only through a strict diet? I fell better on a strict diet, I mean I don’t feel self-intoxication on that diet but very weak, lack of energy and losing weight. Whenever I try to introduce into my diet something like oats or wheat or any other whole food (with fiber) in about 40 mins I feel like a crap (I guess it’s time it takes for the food to reach the large intestine where I have my bad bugs)."
0,promo,2,"Hey everyone,Time to share my candida nightmare that is still presently going on.In mid April 2017, I crashed my motorbike in thailand, and was given antibiotics because of the road rash.I also had unprotected sex with my girlfriend during that month, which we later realized she had a yeast infection.I was peeing a lot like 15+ times a day and I thought I had a UTI which I’ve gotten many times previously.So i saw the doctor, and got more antibiotics, not knowing anything about candida, which of course made things worse.I had a constant urge to pee, and never felt that I got all the urine out. I then started trying different antibiotics, which made things worse again, as my penis testicles and anus got extremely red and itchy.At this point I was going insane, as no doctor had an answer for me, until I finally stumbled across candida online in august 2017. I went straight to the store and got some coconut oil and fluconazole and in 3 days my symptoms dissapeared!Then I had sex with my girlfriend thinking she was healed by now (i know im an idiot) and all the symptoms came right back. i was devastated and became extremely depressed.The fluconazole and coconut oil didn’t work anymore, and I didn’t know what to do. I tried bullshitting my way around different antifungals but never took it seriously, nor did I change my diet at all of many sugars and carbs.I finally decided to just live with it, as I couldn’t deal with the depression after each failed antifungal didn’t work.This went on for a few months, until december 2017 i started having stomach issues, light sensitity and i was having terrible diarrhea and fever for 3 days. I thought i got food poisoning, but after the initial sickness went away, the digestive symptoms and light sensitivty persisted.The doctors didn’t know what the problem was, and I went scouring online again and found out about leaky gut. And what causes it? Candida!I was furious. I was so done with this fucking thing ruining my life, that I went online and bought loads of candida and leaky gut supplements, figuring that If take a bunch at once, that it would have to work.Lo and behold, a week later after taking the supps, my symptoms were gone again. I continued taking the supps for another week just to be sure, and it looked like i was in the clear!After not being able to drink alcohol for so long, i started easing back into it and one night in late feb. 2018 i got way too drunk at the bar and ended up making out with a prostitute (i know, i’m the dumbest person ever).30 mins later I had a weird taste in my mouth and was spitting on the ground. i went home and the next morning i woke up and felt like death. naseau, fatigue, no appetite, fever, red throat, so i went back to the doctors got tested for stds came back negative, and was put on antibiotics due to an obvious bacterial infection I got.It took about 2 weeks and a few rounds of antibiotics to get rid of the initial sickness, but other symptoms then emerged.Now i have the frequent urination, freuquent mucous and swallowing, light sensitivity, brain bog, fatigue, skin rashes all over my body, a bunch of food sensitivities. i can only really eat meat and vegetables now without my symptoms worsening.I was depressed for a long time after seeing more doctors and not having an answer/ me not knowing what to do, until I finally realized it was probably the candida acting up again and i never fully killed it. So I knew I had to come back to the us and take care of this for good. I got the GI-Map Test and Organic Acids Test, and showed positive for salmonella, cholerae, bacillus, enterococcus, staph, step, proteus, fragilis, leaky gut, gluten sensitivity, and of course candida.It’s now july 2018, and ordered a bunch of new antimicrobial supps from a functional medicine doctor online and they should be arriving soon.This is really my last hope, as I have been taken to the brink. I know how insane this story is, and the crazy thing is i didn’t realize how insane i was for the longest time. The candida has been control of my mind since april 2017, and definitely the worst part of this whole disease. Every decision I’ve made, both with my health and other areas of my life has been wrong.I’ve ended up spending 10s of thousands of dollars on doctors, medicines, supplements, and countless hours depressed and laying in bed. I’ve had a rough life, but nothing even comes close to this year and almost one half nightmare.I’ll list all the supplements I have when they arrive, and please let me know if you guys have any tips and/or had experience getting rid of bacteria overgrowth alongside candida. Would also be great to talk someone privately who has gone something similar on pm, email, etc.I’m thankful a community like this exists, when I was too stupid to seek out help before. Hope everyone is doing well."
1,Wiley200,2,"That is a crazy story, well done for sharing and being so honest!My thoughts about bacterial and fungal infections is that there are a lot of commonalities when treating them. You need to boost your immune system by sleeping well and getting lots of healthy nutrition, you need to avoid junk food, and you need to take lots and lots of probiotics.My main advice would be to take probiotic supplements and as many probiotic foods as you can. Make sauerkraut at home – it’s so easy. Buy plain, probiotic yogurt. Get a good probiotic supplement. Start all this with low doses, then increase slowly. Nothing you do will be more effective at restoring long term balance in your gut and elsewhere.Good luck!"
2,sweetcandida,2,How about pure coconut water ?
3,doublek,2,"As suggested above, probiotics would be a good addition. Also, you have to take the antifungals for longer than a few weeks. Just because the symptoms are going away, it doesn’t mean you are cured. Also, look into taking some vitamins and minerals. I recommend vitamin d, biotin, zinc, copper, and magnesium."
4,WhiteTrash,2,"Seems like an ordeal!I can relate to some of your experience, but definitely not as dramatic or severe.What cut it for me for good: Nystatin powder.I had tried natural solutions, oregano oil, garlic, every supplement you can think of.Only a few weeks of Nystatin made me feel normal again.Fludan has a website, it’s eady to order from them"
5,promo,2,thanks for replies everyone.did you do the nystatin powder enema?

6,Lippygirl,2,"I have read that eating any fermented foods such as saurkraut, keffir, kambucha are not recommended if you have Candida as the fermentation mimmicks the candida. A fairly good test is the water test. Take a glass of water to bed and in the morning first thing spit into the glass. If the glob starts to run down the inside of the glass then candida is present, if the glob stays on the surface you have mild candida. Everyone has Candida, some are triggered through poor habits than others. Oxalates also weaken the stomach lining and cause leaky gut which Candida then takes advantage of. Steer clear of spinach cooked or war, potatoes, sweet potato, beetroot, chocolate, oranges, any berries, carrots other root veges and all nuts except macadamias, also no seeds or Tahini. Instead eat cabbage, lettuce or bokchoi corn, plenty of garlic, onion. Broccoli is ok in small amounts. Cauliflower is good, peas, green beans, there are a few lists on google that you can easily access. Stay with that, get rid of flour, sugar, dairy and pork. Then reassess in a months time. Also no beers maybe a little wine or spirits no mixers. Plenty of water 6-8 glasses of filtered water. This has been my experience. Also eat a lot of sprouts as they are apparently a prebiotic. You can eat some black beans, chickpeas of letntils but they do have some Oxalates so small amounts."

8,promo,2,"ok i can see it now, thx man.for the enemas can i use something like this? https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYCAZI6or do i need the big ones with the tubes?"
0,Rob,3,"Hi everyoneI am so tantalisingly close to being fully cured that it feels like it’s just days away. After months of low carb, low grain, no dairy, no gluten, little alcohol, I have managed to get my candida levels down significantly. I’ve done this mostly through nystatin/curcumin enemas every day or every other day. Once I started to see noticeably less candida (at the start I was seeing 10-20 inch strings of fungus every day), I then introduced high dose probiotic and prebiotic sources into my diet and this has paid off massively. Over the course of only 2 weeks, I’ve worked my way up to 2 x tsp of lactulose twice per day as well as fiber supplements (acacia gum, larch arabinogalactan, psyllium husk, PHGG, resistant starch) 3 x per day in increasing doses and all of a sudden i’m having proper, brown, well formed bowel movements every day. This is in comparison to the yellow, mushy, cowpat style bowel movements that have plagued me for 7 years. This is no exaggeration. The change is unbelievable and there was a time I thought this wasn’t possible.The prebiotics are reshaping my gut bacteria, which are now proliferating and producing high amounts of lactic acid, butyrate and other short chain fatty acids. This is creating a more acidic environment in my gut favourable to good bacteria and disfavouring candida rhizomes that are now converting back into a harmless yeast form. My experience at the start of this phase was unsettling because the drastic change in your gut’s environment brings with it a number of unpleasant and uneasy symptoms similar to life with candida. Basically, prebiotics can make you temporarily more symptomatic, constipated, bloated, itchy, tingly etc. as this change takes place. It certainly doesn’t happen overnight.I think one of the most important things to take away from this experience and pass onto sufferers is that although you gradually feel better as you kill off candida in the initial kill phase, you’ll likely not reach a stage where you feel truly symptom-free until you boost the good gut bacteria sufficiently and fix the underlying dysbiosis. I suspect sufferers stay on the kill phase longer than necessary expecting to eventually wake up feeling symptom-free. In my experience, this is not the case. I think it’s only when you restore normal and healthy bacteria levels in the gut that your immune system fully restores and you reach a full and sustained cure with no symptoms."
1,onions,3,"Hi Rob,I have been following your posts with interest. How are your symptoms now?I have been using enemas for about three weeks but have not really progressed, did it take some time for you to progress?"
2,goldsvenicegirl,3,"Rob, can you please reply to me? I’m fascinated by what you wrote.Can u please xplain how you performed the nystatin enemas? I’m about to start them.Also, I agree that the sufferer (me) will probably not feel better until the new probiotics have been introduced as well. Simply killing off the candida probably isn’t enough. I haven’t taken Nystatin yet; I will get some from my doctor on Monday! Help me, please! I’ve also ordered probiotics and am expecting those in the mail as well."
0,TalAd,4,"Hi, I took a stool test about 2 weeks ago, and was diagnosed with the highest level of candida. Since then, I began the diet (diet only, without any supplements) and after very few days I’ve noticed that I no longer have itchy feet, and the fungus on my feet was almost gone. Is this possible? Also, my bad breath has improved a great deal in a few days. Another thing is I don’t crave sugars / cookies / pastries anymore. Not the way I used to before the diet. Could this be something else other than candida?"
0,doublek,5,"Hi everybody, I just recently joined, but have been reading other posts on this site for months. I’ve found a lot of useful information on this site and from other people’s posts, so I thought I’d share my story. Maybe someone else will find something I said useful and I welcome any feedback.This is a long story, so I’m going to split it into parts, so its easier to follow.Part 1 (backstory- before I realized I had a yeast problem) I don’t know when the yeast infection of my digestive track actually started, but my best guess is at least several years ago. I remember maybe four or five years ago, I had “brain fog” and trouble concentrating and went to the doctor. He did some blood work (I don’t remember exactly what he tested), results came back, and he basically told me nothing was wrong. He said, maybe you’re just stressed out. Well, I work two jobs, so I figured that was possible and just ignored the problem. Well, about a year ago, the problem got a lot worse. Everyday I didn’t feel good and started to have neurological problems (my fingers and toes would go numb, it would be especially bad in the morning when I first woke up). So I did some research on my own and the best explanation I could come up with is I had a B12 deficiency. So I went to the doctor (different doctor, I had moved since then). I discussed several possibilities with the doctor and we pretty much ruled out everything since the vitamin deficiency so he had me take some blood tests. The results came back that I was deficient in vitamin B12 (as I expected) and vitamin D. So I though all I have to do is take vitamins and the problem will be solved. I was wrong!Of course taking the vitamins helped, but not to the extent I would have liked. I also stopped drinking alcohol, thinking that would help, but it only had a minimal effect. About six months went by and I was still having some of the same symptoms I had before (although not quite as bad). At this point I started drinking again, although not that often (once or twice a week at most). That’s when things really went downhill. I developed some really bad digestive problems. They were particularly bad the day after I dank. I mean everyone has experience beer shits before, but this was ridiculous. I also constantly had gas coming out of both ends of me. I apologize for being so graphic, but I don’t how else to explain what was going on. So I did some more research to try to figure out what was wrong with me. I came to the conclusion that I had bacterial overgrowth in my intestine (aka SIBO). Not only does SIBO cause digestive problems, it also cause vitamin deficiencies and in particular deficiencies in vitamins b12 and D. Not wanting to go to the doctor and take drugs since I read they weren’t particularly effective anyway (also because at the time I didn’t have health insurance), I decided to try herbal remedies. And I again stopped drinking.Within weeks, I started to feel better. The diarrhea lessened, some of the bloating went away, and I was passing less gas. However, something was still not right and I was still burping a lot. So, I went back to the internet and did more research. I started to read about h plyori and it made sense to me that I also had that. So, I started to take black seed oil and mastic gum. They helped a lot, I finally stopped burping, my stomach felt better. I felt better than I had in months, maybe even years. But something still was not right. I still had bloating, my intestines were still making a lot of noise, and I still did not feel right mentally."
1,doublek,5,"Part 2 (I realized I had a yeast problem) Still not feeling right, I did some more research. I had previously come across information on candida, but had not really looked into it that much. It makes sense though that I would have a candida problem, it usually coexists with SIBO and H Pylori. I also looked in the mirror and saw that I had oral thrust. Actually I’ve had oral thrust for years, but didn’t really know what it was or think that is was that big of a deal. I just figured I had to clean better. Did I mention I had some periodontal problems last year and all this stuff is related?Anyway, at this point I started taking more coconut oil (I was already taking it before for bacteria, but had begun to phase it out) and went on a low-sugar, low-carb diet. As with the bacteria before this, things got worse before they got better since I had some bad die-off symptoms. That was almost two months ago. Since then I had added various herbs, digestive enzymes, minerals, etc. One of the most recent things I added was copper a few weeks ago. I got some of the worst die-off from that, but I’m glad I added it. I also just a few days ago added slippery elm because I was starting to get constipated (previously I never had this problem). It seems to be working. What I realized is that if you don’t go to the bathroom, the toxins build up and you feel horrible.I am not yet cured. I have bad days and I have good days, but overall I am feeling better. The digestive symptoms are minimal now. I only have a little gas and my bowel movements still have not returned to normal. Depending I the day, I sometimes still have bad headaches and I occasionally have numb fingers (but not everyday)."
2,doublek,5,"Part 3 (what I’m taking now)This is a list of everything I’m taking right now, yes I know its long, but my strategy has been to hit this at all angles. I’m not recommending that everyone take all these things or am saying that everything here is necessary. Also, please remember, I did not start taking all these things at the same time, I added different things as I went along.Candex (digestive enzymes)- 2 pills twice a day, first thing when I wake up and before I go to sleep NAC (with molybdenum and selenium)- 600 mg, three times a day Coconut oil- 1 tablespoon, three times a day Caprylic Acid- 1200 mg, twice a day SF722 (undecenoic Acid)- 250 mg (5 pills), three times a day Pau d’arco- 1635 mg, three times a day Peppermint Gels (mostly contains peppermint oil)- 2 pills (362mg peppermint oil), twice a day Slippery Elm- 800 mg, twice a day (I may adjust this depending on how often I have bowel movements, but just started taking it) Irwin Naturals Milk Thistle Liver Detox- 2 pills (150 mg milk thistle and other things), twice a day B12 (methylcobalamin)- 5000 mcg, twice a day Folate- 800 mcg, twice a day (this helps you absorb B12) Vitamin D3- 1000UI OptiZinc- 20 mg Copper- 2.5mg (It’s important to make sure zinc and copper are at right ratio) Biotin- 5 mg Magnesium Glycinate- 400mg A strong probiotic- over 100 billion bateria (34 different strains)I also did take oregano oil for some time, but not taking now, I believe it was working, but is not something that should be taken long-term since it can lead to an iron deficiency.Again, I’m no expert and am not recommending that you do exactly the same thing as me, but hopefully this will give others some idea of different supplements to do their own research on. If anyone has any questions or comments, I look forward to responding.1 user thanked author for this post.  Odiezers"
3,doublek,5,"I cut back on the slippery elm, I’m only taking 800mg once a day now. I was taking too many trips to the bathroom. Otherwise have felt pretty good the last two days. And by that I mean no major brain fog/headaches. The oral thrust is still there so I know I’m not cured yet. I hope I don’t disgust anyone, but being that we are talking about digestive problem I’m going bring it up. I have for a long time had dead candida in my stool (white specs). Don’t worry, I’m not going to post pics, but if you want to see what I’m talking about (you probably don’t) other people have posted them in the past. For the first time I’ve actually seen a reduction in the amount of these specs, so I’m hoping the end is near."
0,jessi.dhanc,6," Hi there, so here is my story: I am a 20 year old female who never had acne my whole life until about last year. The acne started very subtly, and then got worse, it started on my forehead, then developed on my chin as well. This mostly started when I moved into a new house which I suspect had mold. Just recently I got a test confirming candida, and so I have been following the diet for 2 weeks and have been taking: caprylic acid, milk thistle, probiotics, zinc, vitamin C, A, D, B6,omega 3, and magnesium. Basically my skin has not improved, so i’m wondering how long it has taken for people’s skin to clear up assuming it was caused by candida. My candida isn’t too bad, the only other symptoms were depression/anxiety, and signs of poor digestion, but that seems to be back to normal now.(side note, I wash my face twice daily with a gentle cleanser, and I use a few topical treatments like salicylic acid). ANY help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!"
1,doublek,6,"I’d glad to hear that you are feeling better, but you probably are not cured yet. Everyone’s case is different, so there’s no standard amount of time to get rid of candida. However, I don’t think anyone has been cured in just two weeks, you have to give it more time. You may want to consider adding a few other anti-fungals. While over all, the list of things you’re taking sounds good, one thing missing is something to break up biofilms, consider taking NAC or digestive enzymes like Candex, or both. I would suspect that the acne is a symptom that takes a while to clear up, so don’t give up."
0,Rob,7,"Hi guysI have been treating candida related syndrome since October and I’ve been experiencing digestive and immune-related issues for 5-7 years now. My symptoms are as follows:Constipation (Still struggling with this although I suspect that’s partially because I’m doing so many enemas my colon is usually empty anyway) Flatulence (Greatly reduced) Abdominal distention (Greatly reduced) Tingling in hands and feet (Reduced. I believe this is linked to die off) Itchy scalp and hair shedding (hair shedding has now stopped after several years!!! :D) Brain fog (which has now disappeared) Fatigue (I’m rarely fatigued now) Leaky gut – Heightened allergies and food intolerances including gluten (Still working on this but I suspect they’ll disappear once my gut is healed and free of infection)I have been treating myself with nystatin enemas amongst other things and had a major breakthrough on New Year’s Day. I did an extremely thorough enema cleanse (6-10 litres of water) followed by a nystatin / curcumin retention enema, which I managed to get all the way from the rectum to the cecum. That evening, I excreted huge amounts of fungal colonies that I’d never seen before and I’ve since realised that my efforts until that point had been rather half-arsed. I’m repeating this daily and now feeling better by the day. It is surely only a matter of time until I’ve beaten this!It is absolutely essential to get the nystatin to the cecum. Orally, it wont reach the cecum in sufficient concentrations. Rectally, if you’re only hitting the sigmoid colon, then you’re not going to cut off the head of the snake. Please – anyone who knows they have candida, is doing nystatin enemas and not seeing frightening looking dead candida in their stools (long strings of white, yellow, brown fungus that look like noodles), try and go a little deeper 😀Bob"
1,thejacgues,7,"Hey, can you please elaborate if you are using only nystatin and curcumin in the enemas and most importantly, how you make sure that the solution reaches the cecum, where supposedly Candida has most of it’s colonies? How many liters of water do you use for the treatment enema, once the initial cleaning enema is done?"
2,Rob,7,"Hi thejacguesSorry I missed your post and for the late reply.I clean out the gut in the morning or evening with anywhere between 4-8 litres of water. Once the water you’re expelling is clear then you know that the gut is mostly clean and the fungus that lives on the mucus layer is exposed so the nystatin can kill it most effectively. I also use a magnesium stool softening supplement called Colosan before bed. This way I wake up, have a decent bowel movement before I start the cleansing enemas. I use a couple of 2 litre enema bags to do this bit. I never hold more than 4 litres although they say people can hold anywhere between 3-6 litres depending on how big your colon is. I use sea salt in the main 4 litre enema just to guard against loss of electrolytes.For the retention enema, I’m still experimenting but usually I use about 4-8 ounces of warm water with 1 capsule of pure turmeric/curcumin and half a teaspoon of nystatin powder. I don’t put anything else in it. The most frustrating part of this whole process is sometimes I struggle to get the solution to the cecum. On a good day, I use my body and gravity to get the solution down the sigmoid colon. I then shift my body to the right and can feel it trickle down the transverse colon and into the ascending colon and finally the cecum. Then if I massage the cecum area, I can feel water in there and I know I’ve succeeded. Over the last few weeks, I’ve been very inconsistent in this process so have been experimenting to find the perfect technique. The days I manage it, that same evening, I do a quick bulb enema with clear water and expel strings of fungus and biofilms. These are usually white, yellowish, translucent, slightly green. Some of them are disturbingly long. The longest I’ve expelled was about 10 inches. These are biofilms and proof that the infection has lived in me for many years. I experienced die off symptoms after the retention enema throughout the day, which include hands and feet tingling, stinging and blistering hands, itchy scalp. Once I’ve expelled the candida, I feel instantly better, sometimes euphoric. Considering I’ve only successfully got the solution to the cecum maybe 6/7 times, the progress in my wellbeing has been astonishing.Today, I failed about 3 times to get the solution past the transverse colon. It was just sitting in the sigmoid colon so I lost patience and I mixed about 3 teaspoons with about a litre of water and used my cleansing enema bag. There was enough force and solution to whip it round to my transverse colon and I think I got a significant amount into my cecum so I’m excited to see the results tonight haha! Tbh, I think I’m reaching the point where I’ve killed most of it. My energy, tingling, hair loss, bloating are all significantly better and I’m probably at the stage where I’ll introduce prebiotics such as lactulose.Any more questions, happy to help."
3,Rob,7,"In terms of making sure I hit the cecum, you need to clear out the colon so nothing is blocking it. It could be blocked by gas or stool so it’s important to have a proper clear out. I then get on all fours in the “doggy style” position, squirt in the solution and let it trickle down. I shift my body to the right whilst maintaining a position which use gravity so the solution goes deeper into the colon. Once I’ve felt the solution get into the transverse colon, I rest on my right side and try and stay as relaxed as possible. This way the solution gets to the ascending colon/cecum and settles there. After 10-30 minutes, I get up, shower and get on with my day."
4,thejacgues,7,"I tried this technique multiple times and it is really hard to achieve. Anytime I pour ~ 1 litre of enema solution inside (even after the cleaning), I am unable to hold it for more than few minutes.My question is – did you have a colonoscopy made before the enema treatment? When you used to ate certain types of food (let’s say sugars, bread, rice etc) how much time did it require in order to give you the first symptoms?I will make few more attempts but I am afraid I am unable to practice this method."

I take stool softeners throughout the day – Colosan. 1 teaspoon in the afternoon and 1 before bed with plenty of water. I have a big bowel movement in the morning. Then I do a two litre water enema with a tsp of sea salt. Then a 4 litre water enema with 2 tsp of sea salt. I make sure i’ve got everything out and wait half an hour before the retention enema. I then do 4.5-6oz of water with half a teaspoon of nystatin plus a capsule of nystatin. Water has to be warm (more than lukewarm). I insert it on my left side, then I turn onto my back, thrust up my legs into the air and rest on my upper back/shoulders and relax as much as possible until I feel the solution trickle into my transverse colon. Then twist to my right and lie sideways for it to run down into the cecum. You should be able to feel and hear it but I’ve become quite in tune with my body over the last few months. You can do it. Just try and stay positive.Wiley200 wrote:How often are you doing the enemas?

Constipation has always been a major symptom of my candida. I haven’t become dependent on enemas to go to the loo. I know because I have had week long breaks from them and noticed no difference."
7,getbettersoon,7,"Hello, what is the name of nystatin powder that you are using, and the concentration? I’m having a hard time finding nystatin in my country – so far I found ‘oral suspension’ 100,000 nystatin and I don’t know if that’s okay to use for the enema."
8,Rei,7,"I have been doing enemas. I cannot believe how much candida I have in the cecum. I pass different types of candida, some reddish, some yellowish and have passed even some that literally look like big jellyfish. Today I feel fetter although I cannot assure if I can stop this candida from coming out. I have not purchased Nystacin, I only do salt water and baking soda atm.Normal enema bucket is sized 2 quarts, I use this to get the poo out and clean the colon, usually this suffice but if not you may need to redo it.The next 2 quarts salt water enema I can take it fully generally. I retend some.Then I do another salt water enema I do 2 quarts and a half. I retend a bit moreThen the next one I do 3 quarts,Usually by this time it gets late and I do another 2 and a half or 3 quarts with baking soda. I have not tried 4 quarts, I know some ppl can do it, I do not think I can.The more you do the best you can retend it. It is not hard if you introduce the water slowly. I also have a little bench to incline myself and poo easier. It can take a while to fully expel an enema.I started taking ACV and noticed these buggers started to come out more. I take this in preparation for the liver flush. If you guys are constipated chances are you do not eat enough fiber or you have a clogged liver/gallbladder."

No problem, still no reaction. Tried my best acrobatics but have no idea which parts of the intestines it hit.After an hour or so when writing my food journal I realized a slight mistake I made. I got a 1 ml syringe with the Nystatin but used another measuring cup to save time measuring out the 5 ml.

0,kiwifighter,10,"Hey! So I’ve been fighting a skin fungal infection for over a year now and only just turned 27. All started when i bought a pet rabbit that had a type of fungus and infected me and my current partner at the time. We all got treatment but for some reason mine kept coming back constantly. Tried to do the anti candida diet and take antifungals but i clearly havent been doing all the right steps. I was having severe constipation this year and always had IBS. I was under a lot of stress with my previous relationship and moving to a new country. I had colonoscopy to rule anything out i broke out in two big fungal rashes even tho I had been trying to have a clean diet. Been through a bit Saw a dermatologist who said it was not fungus but eczema and gave me prescription cream. 2 weeks later it was worse and spread. Saw him again he said it was ringworm (which I know is highly contiguous) so i was under a lot of stress. This dermatologist was the worse and not very helpful just gave me another cream and prescription meds. Saw a second dermatologist that ruled out ringworm but another type of skin fungus. I then had colon hydrotherapy and did my prescription anti fungals but in one spot it keeps coming back. I also did a blood test for food intolerances and I have leaky gut. Very intolerant to eggs, almonds, quinoa, and buckwheat and slightly coconut. Which leaves me not much to eat on the anti candida diet. Ive realised Ive missed two important steps to break the biofilm of the fungus, enzymes and natural anti fungals and possibly not enough probiotics. Ive ordered some natural anti fungals and enzymes. I hope I can fight this once and for all. Also taking supplements for my immunity I dont want it coming back forever. And apple cider vingear and bone broth are my go to. Just want to live a somewhat normal life again without the worry"
0,CJB81,11,"Hi all,Glad to be here and reading all of your stories and advice.I think I have a candida problem as a lot of the symptoms tally.I’m a 36 year old male and since I can remember I’ve had athlete’s foot, mainly just between two toes the skin would crack open and be very sore, so in the past I’d just buy athlete’s foot spray, and use it every day until the crack healed, then I’d stop using the spray.But it would keep coming back, and when I think about it now, it’s probably been happening constantly on and off for half my life.I live in Hong Kong now since 2011, and for the last 5 years I have suffered from Rosacea, with some big flare ups from certain situations – too much alcohol during a big night out, too much junk food, and/or too much stress.A bad flare up would result in lots of red spots all over my forehead. This still happens often now, and I look awful when it does happen, it’s very noticeable.I also suffer from bad flushing, and I’ve had red cheeks for maybe the past 10 years. With stress the flushing is worse, or from being hot. I can feel it when it happens, like my cheeks are on fire.I’ve tried every kind and and brand of moisturiser, none of them work, most just make it worse, even the ones for Rosacea or sensitive skin.In the last 2 years I clearly developed a fungal nail infection just in my right big toe nail, which then spread less severely to my left big toe nail.I took a course of antibiotics from a dermatologist over 3 months, and it was clearly helping, my toe nails were getting better, and the skin on my feet was getting softer and less peeling. Eventually the skin on my feet was great, soft and smooth, no peeling at all.Before I went to the dermatologist my skin was peeling badly on my feet all the time. I’d trim bits off with nail scissors, I’d peel it off with tweezers, I’d moisturise, I tried everything, but nothing helped.The dermatologist told me it was part of the athlete’s foot problem. So when I thought about it again, I’ve probably been living with this problem too half my life.It’s almost a year since I went to that dermatologist, after taking the final dose of the antibiotics I didn’t bother going back, as I could see it was working, and I presumed this course of medicine would heal the problem with my toe nails and foot skin for good.But I have a feeling it’s coming back now, the skin on my feet seems to be getting thicker again, with a yellow tinge. I don’t think my toe nails ever fully healed, although they’re not too bad to look at.Finally, since being with my wife for 2 years, I seem to have regular bouts of thrush after unprotected sexual intercourse with her, I’m not sure if it’s me that’s the problem here, or her, or both of us. It would usually go away by itself after a few days, or I’d use Canestan cream if very sore and itchy to help.But for maybe almost a year now I seem to have permanent thrush on the head of my penis. Like a constant redness from the bottom of the head to almost the top, and itchy all the time. It just won’t go away. I’ve stopped trying with creams etc, and have just accepted it now.But it’s worrying me now as if it’s now constantly there, it must mean my problem is getting worse, or at a more serious level, as it’s no longer going away by itself, like it used to..Regarding my diet, I try to eat quite healthy during the week, fruit for breakfast sometimes, or porridge with milk and honey, lunch would be rice or salad with meat or fish, dinner would be similar.I stopped drinking alcohol 70 days ago, for different reasons really, more to do with abusing it too much and blacking out.I have tended to binge on junk food at weekends, after eating quite healthy all week I’d want pizza, burgers, sandwiches, curry with naan bread, chocolate, cake, biscuits, crisps, ice cream, cookies, etc. Then there’d be another Rosacea flare up often.I don’t drink much water. This should be an easy one to fix, but I guess I’m just lazy and don’t care enough about my health to try harder. I often forget at work and just concentrate on getting stuff done. I’d say I only drink maybe 2 pints of water a day, which is around 1 litre maybe.Before I got married, when I lived alone I’d often get through a day having drunk no water, and would then go to a bar and drink 5+ pints of beer, or 1-2 bottles of wine at home. At least I am doing better in that area now having given up alcohol recently.So I know my diet needs to be improved, and I’m not helping myself with the weekend binging on junk food. Other people seem to be able to live in similar ways without any noticeable problems though.Having read about Candida over the last week online, it seems that I’ve suffered with most of the major symptoms.Stress is definitely a bad one, as I run a small company here, and I’m constantly stressed and depressed.Someone I know here runs a health and vitality clinic where they help people to find and eliminate the root cause of these kind of skin problems, so I have given him a brief overview of my problems, and he said I should come in for an appointment, and they can discuss what kind of tests are available, as I mentioned I’d read recently that you can get tests to check if you’re allergic to certain foods, or to check what you should remove from your diet.I’m booked in with him next Fri, so hopefully I can find the problem and then work on slowly improving my health to eliminate these problems.Any advice or suggestions on what I can do myself to help would be greatly appreciated.I have read about the diet plan, what to remove etc, what to eat and drink, and what herbal supplements to take, so I was planning on just doing that myself to start with, but I guess having the appointment at this health centre will give me a clearer direction.Thanks for reading.Chris"

0,Vita,12,"Hello everyone! My name is Vita and I’m a holistic nutritionist. I’m gonna tell you my story in regards to curing my systemic candida because lord it was a journey and a half. Hopefully it will be of some use to you all.My medical background: -fibromyalgia as a kid -juvenile arthritis -forever underweight; it’s always been hard for me to gain weight *granted doctors thought I was making it up until someone finally believed me; I didn’t take any medication, instead my parents had be hop around from alternative practitioner to conventional ones with minimal improvement*Fibromyalgia went away by the time I was in grade 6 but my immunity has been shit ever since then. You only had to sneeze next to me and I kid you not I’d have a stuffed nose within minutes. I would always get sick with the flue, sometimes months at a time. Acne started up in grade 10 followed by increased sensitivities to smells, and chemicals. My joints would click very loudly as well, whether it’s when I’m rolling my shoulders or simply walking. I was also diagnosed with depression for the entire duration of highschool and well into university. Another interesting thing to note is that whenever I would eat too many sweets, I would get cold sores. I also got ridiculously stubborn plantar warts that even nitrogen blasting would not get rid so I just ignored them for years…University started and there wasn’t much of a difference except the stress levels hit my body hard. First year, near exam time, I got two tiny rashes. Didn’t hurt or itch and I found that they eventually went away on it’s own once I cut down the stress (dropped a course).I left university after my second year because I realized I wasn’t getting anywhere and was simply spiralling farther down into my depression. I decided to attend the Institute of Holistic Nutrition and it’s been the best decision in my life. Ironically my health was also at its worst then… ________________________________________________________________________________________ My Systemic Candida Symptoms:I started to get the rashes once again but this time a lot larger and more spread out. They were just above my chest area. I visited a doctor only to have them tell me that it’s fungal, and that I should use their steroid cream to get rid of it. Like hell I was going to apply that to my chest area if the side effect is thinning of the skin.Fast forward two weeks and all hell broke loose.Overnight my digestion “shut down” -bloating -gassy -acid reflux -food intolerances and sensitivities I’ve never had -extreme foggy brain and overall depressive mood -bad breath -leaky gutIronically the foods I couldn’t handle all lined up with stuff I couldn’t eat on the Candida diet. If I ate a nightshade my bottom lip would swell up and go numb with cold sores at an exponential rate. Thank god, I had some lysine lying around or it would have been an absolute disaster.**I clearly remember tearing up for a moment because it seemed like food itself was against me…and I LOVE FOOD. It felt like the ultimate betrayal. At that moment I gathered every ounce of my determination and swore to myself that I would get rid of this regardless of how long it takes or how much money because I cannot be a practitioner if I can’t even HEAL MYSELF.**My diet became even more restrictive. All I ate was steam veggies (no nightshades) with a little bit of olive oil, steamed chicken or fish and smoothies with hemp protein powder. It was not easy sticking to such a restrictive diet for months. However I had to eat, I was already underweight and could not afford to lose more.I realized I had an huge overgrowth of yeast because simply changing the diet created a huge positive effect on me. I didn’t take any test. I just knew I had fungal rashes, the diet worked on me, and all of my other symptoms lined up with the typical Candida ones.As the days went by my nails began more and more brittle. I could split them into three pieces. I was losing hair and my acne got worse. ________________________________________________________________________________________Treatment:***please keep in mind I AM NOT A DOCTOR, use this information at your own risk, I am not responsible for any side effects that may occur. I simple want to share my knowledge of what worked for me***After two weeks on the diet I foolishly decided I was ready to start killing the fungus off. I wanted to start off gentle; therefor, I simply used a small amount of pau d’arco tea. Stupid me, because that was enough to knock me out. I couldn’t get out of the car because I was so weakened. When I finally dragged myself to class I was feverish the entire time with my head on the table sleeping.I went to my professors for advice and they called me an idiot hahaha. Well can you really blame me? They never really taught us how to prep for the killing.Essentially here’s what I’ve learned you have to do BEFORE you even consider thinking of killing your candida. 1)BOWEL MOVEMENTS must be good. At least once a day and ideally three times a day. 2)IMMUNE support or overall DETOXIFICATION support – this period will last from as along as 1 month to maybe even 4 months. It all depends on how severely weakened you are and how much shit you have backed up in your system. I decided a month was good enough for me haha.Supplement that I used for 2) is called: FLOR*ESSENCE. It’s an herbal blend that is an extremely gentle and supports the various organs that are in charge of the major detoxification pathways. Has been used in the past as a natural alternative to help alleviate the symptoms of chemotherapy.I got a job at the health food store around this time and figured out that the better deal is actually the DRIED tea. You get far more bang for your buck, you just need to make it yourself instead of buying an already premade one for you. Link>> http://www.nationalnutrition.ca/detail.aspx?ID=1247 (how it looks like)I went through 2 L of the tea. Which took me about 4 weeks to go through.After that my professors recommended that I use a candida kit on the market and get rid of it. Unfortunately after trying this out for 2 months I saw minimal difference. The kit I used is called CANDIGONE by renew life. I decided to scrap the kit and find something else.Luckily around this time my professor told me that apparently Olive Leaf is the only antifungal that has the ability to kill every strain of candida. Considering mine was too stubborn to react to a composition of antifungal herbs I decided to give this a try.Around this time I had a life changing experience and a naturopath passed down a technique to me that allows me to read people’s pulses. It’s based off of Ancient Chinese medicine and you’ll find a lot of acupuncturist use something similar. Essentially I am able to tell the compatibility of various supplements towards myself and others, dosages, and what imbalances are occurring in the body. This completely changed the healing game for me. I was like a medical intuitive except I had to hold your wrist. **whether or not you believe me is up to you, but almost all alternative practitioners have something similar to this, whether they use a machine, muscle testing etc but it all based off of frequencies**Right so back to my story…I used: -Olive leaf by Nature’s Way >> http://www.nationalnutrition.ca/detail.aspx?ID=7180 -Vit C 1000mg by SISU or NOW. I’d alternate really. >>https://amzn.to/2qVxRhb >>https://amzn.to/2JkeS7AMy protocol was something like this: Olive leaf: 6 a day with a meal Vit C: 30 a day; split into three dosages of 10, with a mealThe reason for the high dosages of vit c is because I did a vitamin C flush to determine how much antioxidant my body needs. It’s quite the experience if you have gut problems because you will bloat like no tomorrow, feel very weakened and then have intense diiarhea once your body hits the max amount of vit c you can handle. However based on your max you can calculate your ideal day to day dose. You can google how to do this but it really helps to neutralize all the free radicals in your system. I had to take a ridiculous amount of it; however, felt absolutely incredible the next day. I don’t recommend doing this without someone sort of supervision because it can get rather difficult depending on how bad your gut is.The KEY to keeping the die off symptoms at bay is precisely this vit C. As the olive leaf is killing off the candida, it is releasing various toxins into your system. However it’s already a given that you don’t have enough antioxidants in your system to neutralize because the fungus is systemic; therefor, you will need to take a lot more.Interestingly enough, I never once experience any diiarhea throughout this month even though I was taking such a high dose of vit c. At the end of the month I had several bouts of it and my body told me it was time to completely drop the vit c. Now I don’t take even 1 tablet of it because I just don’t need it.Two weeks into the killing I added blackwalnut into the mix. Every other day I would take about 6 capsules of blackwalnut on top of the olive leaf but during different meals. This prevented the candida from adapting to the olive leaf and continued the smooth killing. >> https://bit.ly/2Hp2HcX ; same company as the olive leafSadly because I was still inexperienced I didn’t realize that by killing it so quickly I was creating a burden on my body, in particularly the liver.YOU ALL MUST HAVE GOOD LIVER SUPPORT WHEN DOING THIS or you’ll have another headache soon after getting rid of the candida..but this time to heal your liver. All the toxins go through the liver first, therefore be sure to find adequate support for it.I hopped around from various supplements but they all worked on me like a charm. I started with something that would for sure provide me with the benefits I needed and that was a liver glandular. I gave it a substantial boost in the first two days, took about 6 caps each day and then dropped down to the following dosages:Liver Glandular- by Genestra: 2 cap with a meal, twice a day. >> https://amzn.to/2HTKX6wOnce that was finished I moved onto Livercare-by Himalaya: 2 caps with each meal (so three times a day >>> https://amzn.to/2vDnWSUThe reason I didn’t just do a liver glandular is because your body gets used to supplements. It’s always recommended to change things. I chose the supplements based on the reviews I get from customers in the store, extra research, and whether or not it’s compatible with me. ________________________________________________________________________________________ THE END: By the end of the month the rashes began to disappear on their own and went away within a week or two after. I still had some digestion problems but that’s because the damage has been done. It’s been about a year since I’ve had something this bad and lord do I have more stories to tell in regards to my healing journey. From getting my memory back to hunting for parasites it’s been quite the eventful couple of months.Regardless, even if you kill it all off you still have a lot of work to do. An overgrowth of yeast, depending on how long it’s been sitting there really takes its toll on the body. In the end I simply took one layer of dirt off my body. For the next couple of months I followed through with various protocols, liver flushes, parasite cleanse, and now I am in my final phases of healing and stronger than I have ever been before. People come by to tell me that I have a glow about me now, even though I still haven’t cleared up the acne, the difference is monumental both physically and mentally.Funnily enough my systemic candida was easier to get rid of than my acne haha. If you have any questions please comment away. I didn’t mention absolutely every experiment that I did because my story is long enough as it is. If I had to go back I would most definitely go about things differently because I have the knowledge on how to support the body a lot better based on personal experience and research. The olive leaf and vit c I wouldn’t change. I would have been able to shorten the healing and minimize the damage the candida did; however, I don’t regret the mistakes I did.I wish you all goodluck and hope that what I’ve shared with you will be of some use to you. If you’re at your wits end and live in Ontario, GTA area, then hit me up and we can work together. I’ll do my best to get you through it because I know first hand what a monster this can be."
1,thesixsaint,12,"Hi Vita, I’ve been lurking on the forum for a month now and just came across your post. I live in the GTA as well and I am struggling with what I think is a candida issue. How can I get in touch with you? (Sorry, I’m new to the forum – just created an account to message you!)"

0,Ben,13,"In late November 2015 I was on a course of antibiotics for an eye infection, it resulted in severe stomach pain and so I stopped the antibiotics, but for a few days afterwards I felt really tired, like I had a virus or something. Eventually it passed, and the Christmas party season was in full swing, so I drank far too much beer, and again I started feeling very tired. Then after eating a chocolate muffin I felt a ‘crash’, I was shaking and dizzy. Then again shortly after eating a sweet biscuit, and also after eating a bowl of pasta, I would have to lie down. I was also getting blurred vision and brain fog.I thought I had diabetes or hypoglycemia, so I went to the Dr, but the tests all came back fine. Then when googling my symptoms I came across Candida overgrowth, I suggested this to a couple of doctors, but they weren’t interested. So I tried a naturopath who agreed it was likely candida overgrowth and perhaps also adrenal gland fatigue.Looking back now there were early signs. 10 years ago I experienced severe heart palpitations, the doctors tested everything, but no problems were found. They eventually subsided, but I still get minor events. I also began developing eczema shortly after this. I also have Seborrheic Dermatitis (yeast infection of the skin on the face) and suffer migraines.More recently I was getting recurring sore throats, short dizzy spells, muscle fatigue, insomnia (I would wake at 3am on the dot every night) and anxiety attacks for no reason. The biggest indicator were my sugar cravings, for about 6 months leading up to the worst symptoms I kept going for chocolate biscuits, and wanting more and more. I mentioned to my wife how I just kept craving sugar and how it was unusual. Now it all adds up.So I started on the candidia diet provided by the naturopath 2 days before christmas, I’ve tried hard not to stray, but I do have some bacon once in a while and cashews now and then. I’m also on the following antifungals and adrenal tablets:Pathoclear Bacto-Cand GI AdrenoplexThen probiotics before bed. I had strong die off symptoms about 2 weeks after starting the diet and tablets, I found lots of water and vitamin C helped a lot. I’m now into my 4th week and struggling with the diet and still feeling tired, shaky and dizzy. I’m hoping that I will eventually get to the other side and feel better, but it is hard going right now. Reading others’ stories is helping.I am 40 years old, and live in Brisbane, Australia"
1,chrisluketaylor,13,"I have had similar experiences with doctors, I got diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome by them. Even though I knew there was an underlying cause for it they just wouldn’t listen.If your adrenals are fatigued, stinging nettle tea is great – or if you need something stronger: stinging nettle seeds.My antifungals are all natural:Grapefruit seed extract Garlic Organo Oil GingerI also take glutamine to help heal my bowels, multivitamin, cod liver oil, and 11 strain or 7 strain probiotics, twice a day."
2,Ben,13,"Yeah, these are natural based.I’m starting to doubt my problem is Candida. I haven’t had any die off symptoms for a while, but I’m starting to feel worse. Shaky, dizzy, blurred vision, unable to think clearly. I felt like I did when I began the cleanse….I’m wondering if it is actually hypothyroid. My muscles feel like they have no energy at all, and I feel like sleeping all of the time. I had a blood test that showed normal TSH levels, but maybe it is worth digging a bit further on that and check T3, T4 and antibodies….."
3,chrisluketaylor,13,"Look up acetaldehyde, it is one of the identifiable toxins candida breakdown produces and can affect the eyes, brain and nervous system.Your best bet is just to keep on a healthy diet until you know for sure it is candida, even if it is something worse (I hope not) you are still going to be making the right choices to help your body to fend off any illness.Also I wouldn’t look too deeply into trying to match your symptoms with other people suffering from CRC, everyone is different and there are different strains of candida species. If I were you I would try adding more healthy fats into your diet in order for your body to get the energy it needs, olive oil and coconut oil are my favourites (I can eat virgin-coconut oil as a snack out the jar when I need a snack, I love it). At the end of the day, listen to what your body is telling you.I have been on my ‘optimimum’ diet for 5 weeks now and my energy levels are still not normalised yet (but I am in the gym 3 times a week and playing basketball 2 times a week now). I get dizzy when I stress myself out (mainly about my health, it’s a vicious circle).I will be reintroducing low GI, Low GL carbs in about 2 months I reckon. Until then I will be sticking to animal fats and plant fats as my main source of energy."
4,Ben,13,"I guess my main thought on candida now is that I’m not experiencing any die off symptoms anymore, so it must be reduced, or the antifungals just aren’t working? I don’t know.I tried some wholemeal pita bread yesterday, big mistake, I crashed for an hour, so looks like I’m stuck on the diet in any case. But I’m still thinking it may be something else. Adrenal fatigue is looking to be a close fit too. I’ve had a heap of stress at work a few months back, lots of urgent late night work, and then again just before this whole thing began I had another emergency late night call that went for 12 hours.Then last week I had domestic arguments just before this latest backward step. And while my sleep patterns were going really well a couple weeks ago, now I’m waking up after 2 hours and can’t get back to sleep.On coconut in the diet, I’ve been cooking coconut flour cinnamon cookies and coconut bread for snacks, they have been a life saver. I’ll try to post the recipes….."
5,Ben,13,"Ok, another update. I started researching what might be causing my problems again, and looked at thyroid and adrenals. Even tried to get the doctor to do some tests, but they don’t seem to get it, so gave up on that. I decided that with my sleep and energy issues it must be adrenal fatigue. I found some articles that talked about taking vitamin B, C, magnesium and fish oil, along with the Licorice root, ginseng and withania herbs.When I first went to the naturopath with my candida problems, she suggested I probably also have adrenal fatigue. But I was so focused on the candida that I was ignoring the adrenal fatigue issue other than the herbs she gave me. I was really missing the vitamin B, C and magnesium. So I have started the following intake of herbs and vitamins and what a difference it has made. My sleep is still a bit off, but improving, but my energy levels have gone from 1/10 to 5/10 after 3 days: With Breakfast 1x Pathoclear 2x Fish oil 7.5ml/5ml liquid Licorice/Siberian Ginseng/WithaniaAfter Breakfast 1x Magnesium 1x VitaminC + Garlic + Zinc 1x Blackmores Executive B MetamucilWith Lunch 1x Pathoclear 2x Fish oil 5ml liquid Licorice/Siberian Ginseng/Withania 1x Magnesium 1x VitaminC + Garlic + Zinc 1x Blackmores Executive BAfternoon MetamucilWith Dinner 1x Pathoclear 2x Fish oil 7.5ml/5ml Herbal Formula 1x Magnesium 1x VitaminC + Garlic + ZincBedtime ProbioticI think the Vitamin C is a big one I’ve been missing, before I started getting the Candida effects I was drinking a lot of Cranberry juice with good doses of Vitamin C, but when I started reacting to the sugar I inadvertently cut out all sources of vitamin C.I’m also working on reducing stress, deep breathing and relaxation massage to see if I can get my twitchy, jitteriness under control."
6,chrisluketaylor,13,"That’s good to hear, I think I also have a bit of adrenal fatigue (hence the stinging nettle tea I drink). So I’ll definitely look into licorice root, ginseng and withania herbs.Thanks"
7,Ben,13,"Yep, I think I’m definitely improving. I’ve actually been able to work and focus on tasks. I do start getting tired in mid afternoon, which is the expected cortisol cycle. Sleep is still up and down, but some nights are solid 10 hours.My next step is to start introducing some carbs that are good for adrenals."
8,chrisluketaylor,13,"I have successfully gone back onto big loads of carbs thanks to quinoa. It is such a great food source. I would definitely recommend it as your first step towards eating grains.I had a load this morning for breakfast on it’s own (must have been about 200g) after gradually working up the size of portions I have no ill effects.My next thing to reintroduce is oats in 2 weeks time, hopefully. Although it is a glutenous grain, there have been studies that gluten intolerant individuals have been able to work upto reintroducing it back into their diet. And it is far easier to get hold of than quinoa and more versatile."
9,declanmartin1977,13,"For longer than I care to remember, particularly during the winter I have been prone to feeling tired and constantly run down. About 18 months ago fungal started to appear on both my big toes. I tired a number of over the counter treatments for these conditions but to no avail. My GP couldn’t get to the bottom of them either. About 6 months I went to see a kinesiologist who diagnosed my condition as candida overgrowth. I commenced a 10 week diet of no diary, sugar or wheat based products, which was a real challenge. I managed to stick to this eating regime. My health improved. However, I’m not convinced I have removed the fungal growth as there’s been little improvement in the state of my toenails. I do eat much better now but don’t stick to the eating regime as much. I need some new ideas as I’m getting really frustrated with the whole thing. I forgot to mention that I’m a very stressful person, which doesn’t help. My sleep has also been badly affected. Help."
10,chrisluketaylor,13,"To heal your fungal nails, apple cider vinegar foot baths are your best bet with topical tee tree oil applied before you put socks on.I had fungal nail far before I had any other symptoms, but unfortunately I ignored it – nearly lost 3 nails in the process – 1 still hasn’t grown back. I don’t use the method I suggested as it can be costly, what I do is I have a natural elements handwash that has tee-tree oil extract and pottasium sorbate in it which I use first to wash my feet and then apply to my nails generously before I put my socks on.I got fungal nail on my big toe first that I had the misfortune of dropping a 20kg plate on 4 years ago – the damage combined with my poor foot-care and poor diet was the ‘perfect storm’ it seems. My ignorance was what allowed it to spread further, and ultimately to various parts of my body.The funny thing now is I can actually see the line on my big toe nail whereby I optimised my diet and foot-care to eradicate candida (it goes from yellowish to clear pink instantaneously ). I just need another 3-5 months before it grows out completely. And then hopefully my little toe nail (which I lost) will emerge at some point in the future too.The only problem being that the leaky-bowel, which I developed from my ignorance, is going to take a lot longer to heal.On the bright side, the outlook I have on my diet (and the knowledge I have gained) will now continue with me for the rest of my life and will massively reduce my risk of cancer, diabetes and heart disease. So in a way my CRC was the wake-up call I needed, I just wish I had wised up to it sooner or was actually educated about these things when I was younger (but coaching to pass some exams is apparently more important)."
11,Ben,13,"Ok, I’m back!I had moved on to adrenal fatigue treatment, which helped a lot, but I started getting severe anxiety attacks over small issues, and also still had tremors and tingling in my arms and legs, particularly in the middle of the night. My energy levels had really improved up until a month ago, then I had a major energy crash and my anxiety issues disappeared at the same time. So there was definitely a connection between my physical symptoms and the mental ones. I went to see a new naturopath to make sure I was treating the adrenals properly, he tested me for pyroluria. It came back positive, there is a connection between stress, and the excessive production of pyrrol by the liver, which in turn interrupts digestion and can promote candida. Disruption of digestion can then cause your adrenals to become run down as you aren’t getting enough nutrients to fuel the body’s response to stress.So I’m back on the candida diet, some anti-fungals (getting the die off feeling again) and also supplementing for pyroluria (vitamin B6 and zinc) along with VitC and Magnesium. It will take a few months but hopefully I’m on the right track.I thought it was worth sharing the pyroluria link with candida and IBS in case others may also have this underlying issue."
12,Jaumeb,13,I agree with Chris in that quinoa can be very helpful.
13,EasternRay,13,"Hi Ben,What have you used to treat the adrenal fatigue? What supplements, drugs and what diet? That would be interesting to know.Cheers."
14,Ben,13,"laurenziano wrote:Hi Ben,What have you used to treat the adrenal fatigue? What supplements, drugs and what diet?

Also went on herb mixes, usually with Withania, Licorice root, Holy Basil and Siberian Ginseng.I have now moved on to pyroluria treatment and feeling a lot better. Mentally the brain fog has gone, so has the anxiety and edginess/nervousness.Energy levels are up, but if I push too hard I am having a minor crash one or two days a week. Still an improvement.Pretty sure I still have candida issues, and apparently the zinc deficiency can lead to this. So aiming to get the zinc and copper levels back in balance, then tackle the candida, and build the adrenals back up."
0,DeadMax,14,"I think first post didnt go through…Hello,I have dealt with some issues I believe is related to Candida and Leaky Gut, and possible other intestinal issues. About 12 years ago I was in a skateboard accident and injured my left abdominal area. The accident cause a lot of trauma damage to the area and left it really inflamed. A few days after that I had a case of food poisoning from what I believe was wild mushrooms. Ever since that time I have not felt right and developed the problems im dealing with today. My main issues i’m dealing with are:Brain Fog: Spaciness, fuzzy thinking, not feeling sharp. (catch myself staring) Anxiety Depression Intestinal Pain Oral Thrush Intestinal discomfort Always chapped lower lip (upper lip fine never chapped) fatigue etc… the usual.In the past I have tried many things to help resolve this issue and have had my ups and downs with it; Although I have never been able to fully recover from it or even close id say. I have tried diets and supplements like Candex, coconut oil, probiotics, colostrum, etc…the standard ones really. I havnt noticed to much of a difference taking them other than some “die off” or not feeling well. With feeling so bad with die off, I would imagine I would actually see something come out or improvement of symptoms. I have taken them long term and havnt see much improvement. Only one I really found a difference with was Garden of Life Primal Defense, but I dont think its the same formula these days unfort.Anyway I believe my biggest problems stem from the leaky gut and the candida. I have read a lot about it and found some really awesome posts of people and their experiences. After dealing with problem for many years, and having lost a relationship with my best friend because of it, its time to put this to an end.This is what im doing now:Water Enema’s (Possible Nystatin in the future if I have the courage) Nystatin Oral Suspension (would like to get powdered soon) Multi-Vitamin (heard conflicting arguments, but seems to help me) Vitamins C (normal dose) B12 Turmeric/Curcumin Supplement Saccharomyces Boulardii (havnt taken it yet, will do soon after nystatin round)I am not exactly eating a anti candida diet, my diet right now is more focused on lowering inflammation. I do eat sugar although not a ton of it, and in the form of fruit. My diet is mostly fruit, vegetables, almond butter, flax seed, chia seed; usually make a veggie soup and snack on the rest. Vegan diet by the way.Results so far: I have been doing this diet for the last 4 days or so and the Nystatin for about 7. I dont think the nystatin started to work until about day 6 or so when I started to feel light headed, drunk, dizzy feeling and its lasted for a few days now. Seems like its doing something. What really has me impressed right now is the Enemas. The first enema or series of a few in a row, I saw a piece of fungus looking material that was about 3-4 inches long floating in the water. The Last few times, ive done them ive see similar things, but not as big. Definitely looks like fungus to me. I did take a picture as well. Although I havnt felt a lot of change, knowing that is coming out is a good sign in the right direction.My ideas for this protocol is based on what a poster on here is saying named dvjorge. I dont see their posts anymore so I think they are long gone. I have seen his posts on curezone as well, and is a wealth of information and has mostly cured himself with a similar protocol. Look up dvjorge on here and curezone, wealth of information!I will try to keep this post updated with my results regardless of if people reply or not. I guess if I have success with any of this I would like to maybe help someone fishing around the net for posts like I do. Thanks for reading!"
1,Wiley200,14,Have you tried the Saccharomyces Boulardii yet? I heard great things about it.1 user thanked author for this post.  DeadMax
2,DeadMax,14,"I have not tried the Sacchraomyces Boulardii yet, still on the Nystatin. I am def looking forward to it, as I have also heard lots of good things. I hope it will live up to the hype. Honestly, I think the enemas are really helping. I feel like I am a little bit more clear headed and less down I guess; not a huge change in either, but I think just a little bit noticeable. At this point for me its just the enemas, almost daily, and the nystatin plus supplements. Ive seen some weird things come out. Lol Strongly recommend the enemas."
3,DeadMax,14,"Still doing my routine, I however just stopped the Nystatin Oral Suspension and started to take Saccharomyces Boulardii today. Obviously still too early to tell. The brand I am taking is Jarrow Formulas Saccharomyces Boulardii + MOS at 5 billion per capsule. Currently just taking one per day, will move it up to multiple times a day after I see how I react to it, just to be safe. Again, still doing the Enemas, and pretty much see stuff come out every time I do them. I definitely feel cleaner after them and seeing the stuff come out makes me believe i’m doing something right! Never seen so much stuff come out doing regular protocols like diet and supplements. The Nystatin Oral Suspension may have aided seeing things in the clean outs, but I kinda dont feel like it did a whole lot in the colon. Have a good day."
4,Wiley200,14,Be careful not to do too many enemas. Eventually your body will become dependent on them and forget how to do a proper bowel movement all by itself.What kinds of fruit are you eating? Are you sticking to the low sugar types?
5,DeadMax,14,"I mostly eat green bananas as my fruit, but also all types of berries. Nothing super sugary or anything. Although I’ve been on a low sugar diet, my main diet is more based upon lowering inflammation. I’m not too concerned about becoming dependent on the enemas, as I eat tons of fiber and have regular bowel movements during the day; Of course its something to keep an eye on. I don’t eat junk food either, my diet is mostly plant based whole foods."
6,DeadMax,14,"Update:Hello,Just an update for people who may come across this thread. Most everything has stayed pretty much the same as far as protocol. I have eaten a few burritos, that had brown rice and pinto beans and a tortilla(vegan), even though it wasn’t apart of my planned diet. I guess I failed in that aspect, plus a few things during thanks giving like potatoes and a little vegan doughnut. I know, I know, its terrible, but it is what it is. Just being transparent. Even though I had these items, I have overall been feeling better. Hard to say how much as I do have my ups and downs, but as a whole I am feeling better for sure. I have slowed down on the enemas lately, just due to schedule, but will be back to doing them almost daily. As far as diet goes, I will be back to bananas and whole fruits mostly bananas and berries. And my vegetable soup which is low sugar, and high fiber(also really tasty). I think I am feeling better due to doing the enemas and simple high fiber, anti inflammatory diet. Although I wasn’t feeling much while it was being done all the time, I feel as if my work over the last few weeks is catching up a little bit allowing me to feel better now. Maybe it just took a bit for my body to clean up after it had the opportunity to reduce the loads. Idk just a thought.Oh, and also I had some simple blood tests done: CBC Comprehensive Metabolic Panel TSH By the looks of everything, it all seems to be normal and within range for the most part. I guess its a good thing, but I always want to see something wrong so I can work on fixing it. Its so difficult to work on things when you dont %100 know what it is and also dont know %100 how to fix it. The struggle continues.So what am I doing now…-I will be back on the enemas, just plain water possible adding coffee enemas in the mix. Close to daily-Eating mostly anti-inflammatory diet, like fresh raw fruits and vegetables. Vegetable soup, nut butters, and a few other things to add calories. Not sure what I would like to add yet as I want to choose wisely and not over complicate things.-Supplements include: Saccharomyces Boulardii (2 capsules morning and 2 at night. 5 million per capsule). Multi Vitamin. B12. Vitamin C. Sometimes ill do a few drops of Molybdenum as well. Today, I just started today to take NAC(N-Acetyl Cysteine) no additives. It seems like I am feeling the effects of the NAC after just the first capsule 600mg, again hard to say for sure, but hopefully it will provide some benefit. I stopped the Turmeric/curcumin after I started the S. Boulardii.Planning continuing the this protocol for now. Prob wont be taking the NAC everyday, but we will see how it goes slowly. So thats the plan, I might do more blood work, and would love to check up on heavy metals and minerals, and all that fun stuff, but that also means more $$$. Just trying to keep this updated, it helps me and maybe one day it could help someone else. Keep your head up and have a great day. We got this!"
7,Wiley200,14,Don’t beat yourself up about eating a few potatoes. You’re meant to have some carbs on this diet. It’s not a keto diet.NAC is a good choice – it breaks down biofilms as well as providing liver support.
8,DeadMax,14,"Hey Wiley200, Thanks for your comment! Im not really beating myself up, but I did want to at least be open about what im doing, more of my focus is a anti-inflammatory diet rather than really low carbs or zero sugar diet.I have read some promising things about NAC and heard people recommend it, so I started to use it. Helping breakdown the biofilms and a precursor to Glutathione, seems like an awesome thing, hard to pass up by the sounds of it. Hope it helps out, although too early to tell if its doing anything, and I am only taking 600mg as ive heard some take much more. I like to read up and possibly include things without going too overboard, especially since its so easy to just throw a bunch of stuff at it and hope it turns out good. Some things im looking to include are:Bentonite clay Activated Charcoal (I use on occasion atm anyway, but maybe more of a regular thing) High Dosing of Vitamin CI have not added these things yet, I am still trying to research them and determine if its a good addition to my protocol. I dont want to over complicate things, and get lost in what helps and what does’t help. Just some thoughts.Oh! I also have some Broccoli Sprouts currently going in my kitchen! I will be incorporating them into my diet as well. Lots of great things to read about on Sulfuraphane."
9,vaer,14,I tried only Turmeric before bed (500mg) for 14 days and It was helping (die off First day or two)Keep us updated
10,DeadMax,14,"Hey Vaer!Thanks for the response. I really do think Turmeric is a great thing to use for this, as it has so many benefits with little to no downside; plus its a pretty safe thing to use. Currently I have stopped taking the Turmeric as I have been taking the S.Boulardii, as I didnt want it to hurt the beneficial yeast I am taking. The Turmeric that I use also has Curcumin and Black Pepper in it to help its potency. Do I think it alone is going to cure these issues, no, but I think it has a very positive effect.As far as an Update:Everything is pretty much the same, as stated in the previous post. I havnt been able to do as many enemas that I wanted, but everytime I do them, I can see things come out. If I could recommend that somebody do one thing to help themselves out, it would be the enemas. I have done many things to fight my gut issues, but physically seeing things come out, that you didnt eat, is really the game changer imo. If this is a route some are interested in, research the correct safe way please.Diet As far as diet goes, I am still doing an anti-inflammatory diet. Breakfast smoothy consisting of Bananas, blueberries, flax seed, chia seed, greens mix, and broccoli sprouts. Lunch and dinner could be vegetable soup, or lentils and even some beans and rice on occasion, but I try to load those up with anti inflammatory herbs n spices. I also include snacks such as nut butters, raisins, whole nuts, etc…things like that. Thats basically what i’m eating. I have noticed less pain in my gut area, and my bm’s are good, due to the high fiber content.Supplements So the supplements I am taking now include: S.Boulardii(although coming to the the bottom of the bottle, prob will stop) NAC (makes my gas smell very strongly of sulfur type) B12 MultiVitamin Vitamin C with RoseHips(new) 1000mg Vitamin C 65mg RoseHipsAfter the S.Boulardii is done, im going to include the Turmeric again. Additionally, I do eat sauerkraut almost everyday, but only small amounts. Some things I’m still looking into are the Bentonite Clay and Higher Dosing Vitamin C. I will be doing some Activated Charcoal rounds, every so often for a clean out.So what are my thoughts? I think that the enemas are cleaning out the Colon and able to reduce the load of junk in your system which, in theory, allows the liver and other immune system functions to catch up a little. The S.Boularddi is hopefully slowing down or crowding out the non-beneficial yeast and bacteria, and the less the better. The NAC is helping to break down the biofilms of the yeast and bacteria, although seems counter productive to the S.Boulardii, only started to really take more of it recently as the my bottle or S.Boulardii is getting low. NAC is also helping Glutathione production, to aid immune system and liver. Vitamins are just that vitamins, making sure my body is getting enough. The Vitamin C at 1000mg is hopefully helping to stimulate the immune system as well and also help with stomach acid. My goal I guess you could say, is to reduce the load on the immune system, while at the same time boosting it, thus improving the health of the body allowing it to recover and put up a better fight against our ailments. So far I would say yes, it has been helping, but also these things take time, even though we wish it was instant.Sorry for the long read, I know it could be a little much, but I just want to be clear in what im doing. So many posts leave you wondering more or exacts, and I dont want that. Best of luck to everyone, do some enemas, if your body can take it, you might be surprised at what comes out. I do have some “fun” pictures ill save for a rainy day…(winter is coming). Best of luck to everyone, ill keep updating. Take Care.1 user thanked author for this post.  vaer"
11,DeadMax,14,"Hello,Just another Update:To start off, I have not had the best diet, and def failed as far as that goes. The holidays and just overall being busy, I kinda didnt do so well. What I have done very well with is the enemas! I have been doing them every night for the past 10+ days or so and think they are what is really making the difference. I see things come out every time, sometimes more sometimes less. I would describe it as white/yellowish flakes of dead tissue looking stuff mostly. From my understanding, the “candida” or “yeast” that people describe is more likely dead or dying tissue even mucus. I dont really know for sure if what we are seeing is candida or yeast, but I feel it is basically one in the same. They yeast will possibly feed off of it and/or possibly form colonies on it, so either way I think getting it out is the right thing to do. Anyway, the only thing that I have seen produce the results of seeing any significant results is the enemas.Current Protocol:Daily Enemas Diet (its been bad, but hopefully do better soon. I do anti-inflamatory not low carb) Vitamin C 2g daily NAC 1200mg daily b12 Probiotics(just started today)Ok here are some PICTURES of some things that have come out:***WARNING WARNING WARNING*** YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT POOP AND STUFF IF YOU CLICK THE IMAGES.https://imgur.com/a/L1T4r https://imgur.com/a/lN8MS https://imgur.com/a/ALQvC https://imgur.com/a/VCgRF https://imgur.com/a/aL4uC https://imgur.com/a/w7RLJI know its a weird thing to post, but I think some of you secretly enjoy looking at these types of pictures! 😉 Let me know what ya think. LolWill try to update sooner next time, although I will be out of town for a bit in early January. Best of luck to all."
12,DeadMax,14,"Hello,Update: I have been doing better with my anti-inflammatory diet, although def not perfect. Much better than it was around christmas time. I have continued to do the enemas almost daily and would say had the best “clean out” the other day, where I saw a bunch of tissue type stuff. I guess similar to the 3rd picture I posted in the last post, but more white with a little yellow tint. I see this stuff as like dead tissue, regardless, there was a good amount of it. On that day I did a series of enemas, well here’s what I do: I use boiled water with about 48oz per bag. I add a few turns of a sea salt grinder. I lay down inside my bathtub and let loose until I feel full and have to go. Usually it takes 3 clean outs per bag. I do this with 2 bags, which is about 6 clean outs. The first bag usually is just clearing the way, while the second bag generally produces more “stuff”. I dont hold the first ones at all, I just let it in then let it out. The second ones, I sometimes hold and sometimes dont wanna wait. When I do hold it in, ill shift from my left side to my back with my bum up, to my right side then release after anywhere from 5-20 minutes. Basically what I do. On the day I had the good clean out, I did 2 bags then a few hours later did another 2 bags. In that second session, there was significantly more of that stuff. I did another 4 bag day and also had good success with it as well.Current Protocol: Daily Enemas (nearly) Diet (Anti-Inflammatory Vegan, getting back to it) Vitamin C 2g daily NAC 1200mg daily b12 Probiotics (30 million[20m lac 10m bif] 3 times a day)Things ill be adding: Zinc 15-30mg daily Wheatgrass powder MSM (not entirely sure how much yet, or when im getting it) GlutamineSo overall, I would say, that I have more energy, a little less spaciness, just overall feeling better. I still have a lot of depression just due to life stuff, which makes it difficult to judge how much all this is helping. I do believe that it has kept me more “sane” if you will(the enemas I think are the real changer). I still have a dull pain on my mid-lower left side I believe related to the intestines. This is why I am going to include the glutamine, zinc and msm as I’ve heard they are great gut rebuilders. Msm in particular has me interested, it has alleged benefits of anti inflammatory, anti fungal, gut rebuilding, and many others that spark my interest. Anyway thanks for reading. Ill try to keep posting N stuff. Have a good day and a healthy new year! 🙂"
13,Rob,14,"Hi mate, seems like you’re doing well. My advice to you would be not to worry about putting nystatin powder in the enemas (if you can get your hands on it). It’s not harmful to the gut and isn’t absorbed into the bloodstream. I’ve been using it extensively since October with no ill effects. New Year’s Day I had a major breakthrough and got the nystatin all the way to the cecum, which is where the main colonies of fungus and biofilms are based. I’ve since tried to replicate that method and had massive success. I’ve very quickly felt tons better. Energy wise I’m a different person in just a few short weeks and I’ve not yet perfected the technique. Read my latest thread in this forum if you want more information.I think the anti-inflammatory diet is fine. I’d advise to minimise sugar and inflammatory/allergenic foods as much as possible but I’m questioning just how strict you need to be. I personally doubt you need to have zero carbs if you can get the antifungal enemas to the right spot. It’s quite literally poison to candida and I doubt it’ll resist the treatment just because of a few grains or a bit of starch every now and then. Then again, that’s just my opinion."
14,RiversTrini,14,Oh my. Finally people who understands all I have been through
0,Masterx,15,"Hi , sorry for my bad English. I have finally managed to kill this beast.I have been struggling with it for 3 months after prolonged antibiotics use.i had constant abdominal pain upper left and interstinal issues. To kill it Use raw garlic and fenugreek seed. Choose wisely start of therapy because of strong raw garlic smell.You will cut out sugar, fruits and bad carbohydrates during therapy , you can eat eggs , meat, probiotic yogurt , fish, olive and coconut oil and so on , also pumpkin seeds , oath bran, buckwheat , a lots of lemonade. This is only during this short therapy.You will eat 1 whole head of raw garlic on empty stomach in the morning for 2 or 3 days . Then 2 hours after raw garlic do not eat anything . You can drink tea or lemonade or water. Then later on these days eat regular healty food i have mentioned. Also before you go to sleep , eat another head of garlic (2 hours after last meal) You will cut garlic cloves on small pieces then shake it with yogurt + prepare another glass of water , you will need water to drink it if you have trouble swallowing garlic pieces or if thay stuck in your throat. Do not chew it!!!!Then after these garlic days take a rest for 4,5 days than repeat. On rest days eat also healthy and first thing in the morning you will eat fenugreek seed 2 tea spoon with one teaspoon of jam. Yes i know its sugar You will use coffee mill for fenugreek seed to cut it then after that take it with jam and shake it in your mouth than swallow! When weak and hungry candida try to eat sugar from jam fenugreek will kill it. Before sleep also take 2 spoons with one spoon jam. Dont forget to use coffee mill for fenugreek seed first!Repeat this for 3 weeks. This will cure it 95%.Warning you will experience some die off on days when you do not eat garlic do not worry!! Just continue."
1,RedSky,15,"Interesting idea, and I’m pleased it worked for you. I’m not sure I could stomach a whole garlic head, last time I swallowed just one clove I was sick after a few hours.Do you take the skin or peel off? I’m pretty desperate and thinking and retrying garlic, but maybe in smaller amounts due to past experiences."
2,Masterx,15,"Peel off first , try it and be consistent , it can’t kill you , just swallow it as fastest as you can. After few hour when you eat some food you should feel pleasent warmth in stomach. If you dont experience die off symptoms of course."
3,RedSky,15,I’ll give it a try on Sunday when I don’t have much to do. Can’t do with being even more ill on a weekday!
4,Ciara,15,Did you chop it up? Can I just have like minced garlic in the morning?
5,Ciara,15,Also how did you know you had beat it? did you have testing done? Thanks!!
6,Masterx,15,"You can chop it, but in bigger pieces, the bigger the better, garlic pieces must reach your gut as whole that’s the point. So not minced. I saw garlic pieces later in stool. Yes i did test , also no more constant abdominal pain in gut at left side and and i have normal stool , normal color and well formed.Its not easy i know but therapy must be very strong if you want faster healing.Also you can take any antifungals always during the therapy as support"
7,Ciara,15,Why can’t I chew the garlic??Also you said a whole pack? Why not just one clove? I feel like it will come out through my pores if I have too much.Thanks!!
8,Masterx,15,"I told you already in previous post . You can chew it or mince it, but it will not have any effect at all on candida. So do it on my way, if you want healing! Tnx Actually did you know that if you for 7 days eat garlic continuously like i have described up , you can heal it in 7 days. Problem is smell of course 😉"
9,Ciara,15,"Oh wow!!! Sorry I missed that! I started taking the garlic clove (one in the morning and one at night) for two days and I just saw some Candida in my stool but it came out very loose, but have been feeling not super great. Did you also experience this?I have a bunch more other questions if you don’t mind!!Also about the fenugreek, you use a coffee grinder or maybe even a processor to break down the fenugreek seeds, and then mix the jam and fenugreek together?When you say try to eat sugar from jam fenugreek, what do you mean? like just have that throughout the day when feeling not so good?Why do you think its ok to have the jam?Thanks so much!!!!!! I’m super excited i’ve started to see the Candida"
0,Noturbo,16,"Hi guys, i’ve been suffering with Candida since I was about 18. I’m 34 now and its time to get my life back. I’ve researched so much over the years and have pretty much known its been Candida all along, except when I wondered if it was h.pylori. but I did a breath test and it was negetive. I did a Mastic gum and probiotic treatment anyway because well, as im sure you know, you’ll try anything. Ive taken so many supplements and diets and nothings really worked. My symptoms are very poor digestion, constipation, past fungal nail infection(treated with terbinafine) bad skin, extreme fatigue, anxiety, depression, bad breath, body odour… so yeah I could go on and on, and yeah it sucks to be me lol. Its actually driven me to miltiple suicide attempts. People dont realise the impact a serious systemic Candida infection can have on a persons quality of life(especially drs unfortunately). So anyway thats the boring history of me lol. Ive switched to a fully vegan diet a few months ago, consume no sugar except fruit, dont drink, no coffee no smoking etc. I’ve also just started drinking apple cider vinegar again. Also started acv enemas a few days ago and take castor oil at bed time so i have a bowel movement every morning now. Ive also ordered another liter of braggs, another liter of organic cold pressed castor oil and a small bottle of pure gum spirits of turpentine. Going to do the turp mon/wed/fri. Ill do it with castor oil on mon and wed and with sugar on fri. From what ive read with the castor oil it will break down the colonies in the gut and with the sugar it gets into the blood stream, so its a full on assault from all angles lol. I will still take the castor oil every evening anyway to keep me regular. I may also do smoothies and go fully raw while i try this detox. I was going to ask a few questions too. My first few enemas nothing much came out, just smelly liquid mucus, smelt like vomit(sorry thats gross i know lol) but tonight i took in twice the liquid and doubled the amount of acv and had 4 seperate eliminations and on the 3rd so much stuff came out. It absolutely stunk and looked weird. It looked like fake poop lol. It looked rubbery and shiney and it was in spirals, and there was ALOT of it. Also some of the weird floaty membrainy stuff ive seen on some yt videos when people do coffee enemas. There were also little bright red things, possibly tiny worms. They were about 4 or 5mm long and 0.5 to 1mm thick but ive never seen or heard of what they could be. So what was all that spirally poop lookin stuff? Just poop, mucus? Parasite? And could those red things be worms? If so what are they called? Sorry for waffling and asking too many questions ill stop now lol. Thanks in advance for any replies.Hope you guys are feelin ok today 🙂"
1,Noturbo,16,"Also i’ve noticed that now i’m doing enemas the Castor oil doesnt seem to be having as good of an effect. I’m going to try 2tbs instead of one tonight and see if that does the trick. Fingers crossed. Missed a delivery today grrr. Got to go and pick it up at the PO tomorrow and expecting 2 other deliveries. Its my acv, castor oil and turp… cant wait to start it now! I just hope I can post about having positive results in the near future 🙂"
2,Noturbo,16,"Well it seems like not many people post in here, pitty. But ill keep posting in this thread anyway for anyone googling their problems and hopefully I get results people can replicate. Also I will keep asking questions in the vein hope someone might answer one day lol. Anyway… my turp arrived today, whoop! Couldnt resist trying it asap, so I waited 5 hours after I last ate and tried 2ml of turp on a teaspoon. I will have 2ml with a tbs of castor oil at bedtime. I will try and have my evening post workout protein smoothie a little earlier than normal as I want an empty stomach when I try it. Is it best to take this in the evening or in the morning? Im rethinking and tbinking morning may be better. Ill try morning tomorrow I think."
3,Noturbo,16,Oh and on a side note… my farts stink since doing the enamas lol. Going to stop them while I do the turp as I want to coat my gut with turp/castor oil and not constantly wash it out.
4,Wiley200,16,"Are you sure you want to take turpentine? That stuff kills everything doesn’t it? I would maybe check with your pharmacist or doctor first.With the castor oil, make sure that you’re not getting too dependent on it for bowel movements. Your body can ‘forget’ how to do this itself if you continually rely on some kind of supplement to keep you regular. Taking probiotics and probiotic foods instead can get your gut back to health and enable it to take care of bowel movements itself. Or maybe try a fiber supplement like psyllium (the pure stuff, not the brands like metamucil).Have you done a stool test?"
5,Noturbo,16,"Good point on the castor oil. I will definately be carefull with it. Infact I will only use it for this short detox and give it a break afterwards and will follow with probiotics and maybe some psylium husk as you suggested. I took my dose this morning and just a couple of things to note… about 20 – 30 minutes after taking it I got a slight burning pain in the centre of my chest. Also a slightly strange head feeling after that, not drunk exactly but a bit weird. Like if you turned your head quick it would take your eyes a bit to catch up, does that even make sense? Lol. And now just a slight stomach ache and slight pressure in my gut. Atleast its doing something haha. Anyway going to eat now so hopefully that will help. I’ve got a quiet couple of days while I get used to this and how my body reacts. Oh, also… I’m changing my routine a little. 1st week doing sat,sun,mon,tue using castor oil the 1st 3 days and sugar on the 4th. Then every sat,sun after that doing castor oil sat then sugar sun. I will update progress regularly for anyone interested in this approach. Thanks for your reply Wiley 🙂"
6,Noturbo,16,"Update… just had 2nd bowel movement of the day at 2:15pm and it was pretty loose but no visable nasties… I didnt go poking around in it though lol. Oh and something that may be unrelated, even though its never happened to me before and it started within an hour of dose. My left ear is really REALLY tingling at the top. Feels so strange. God knows if its related but just something I’ve noticed lol"
7,Noturbo,16,"Hey guys, not much to update really. Still trying my best. Going to try water fasting too till tuesday, then maybe just smoothies for a bit. Hope i dont lose too much weight… no improvemant in symptoms yet."
8,Wiley200,16,"Be careful that you’re not stressing your immune system too much. You need that to be in good shape to fight off whatever you’re suffering from. And what are you putting in your smoothies? Avocados, probiotic yogurt and greens would be good. Plus maybe some protein powder and a few low sugar berries like frozen blueberries. Remember that putting something through the blender will generally increase its glycemic index."
9,Noturbo,16,Im hoping someone can help me identify possible parasites or fungus from my enemas. I would post a pic but im not sure how or if its allowed. Im getting lots of rubbery looking chunks and when they have been out of water for a couple of minutes they take on a honeycombe type of texture. Like little craters on the surface about 1-2mm across. What is this stuff? Please help lol
10,Wiley200,16,"I guess you could post a pic to imgur and then add the link here.I’m still not sure that repeated enemas are the way to go… Better to focus on improving the balance of your intestinal flora, with some biofilm-busters and antifungals thrown in."
11,foodienyc,16,I have been taking collagen powder mixed with water. I heard that is supposed to be good for your intestinal lining. And I also did a bone broth fast that really helped lift my brain fog.
12,warmwaters,16,Hello there!I have been following your posts and I see that you suffer from bad breath as well! Any updates? I am one month into the diet and so far no results.
13,Rob,16,"Hi NoturboHoping you’re feeling positive. I’ve had candida for 7 years so I feel your pain. I feel like I’ll beat it imminently as I’ve been following DVJorge’s protocol that you may or may not have seen on this site.Couple of things – you don’t have systemic candida in my opinion. Systemic candida is when it’s floating around in your bloodstream and that’s different to Candida Related Syndrome. CRS is when candida converts from yeast to fungal form and causes leaky gut meaning toxins, yeast, bacteria can seep into the bloodstream from the gut, which causes a ton of nasty symptoms that you’re experiencing. If you had an actual systemic fungal infection, then you’d be not too far off death!I see you’re doing enemas but I’d steer away from doing them with ACV. ACV is anti fungal but also antibacterial. This means it’ll also kill any good bacteria in your colon and possibly sterilise your gut. Seen as though antibiotics are a main culprit for candida, I wouldn’t advise this. Nystatin is one of the only pure anti fungals that has no effect on your colonic bacteria so is completely safe to take via an enema. You can buy it on Fludan.com.With Nystatin enemas, I’ve seen long white, yellowish strings come out (sometimes up to 6 inches long). I’ve done maybe 6/7 of these enemas since the New Year and I’m feeling like a new person and making a ton of progress. A lot of symptoms have either gone or hugely diminished. The issue is you need to clean the colon fully first so that it’s clear to inject the Nystatin. Then you need to use 4-8 ounces of water, nystatin (and curcumin optional) and use gravity and your body to get the solution all the way to the cecum, which is the right far end of the colon (an absolute bitch to get to!). If you can get the solution there, it’s practically poison to the candida in their main home. I promise you (if you definitely have candida i.e. have done a blood or stool test and you know for sure), then this may be the answer for you."
14,Tubrik,16,"Hi Noturbo, could you, please, share a link where you read about taking castor oil with sugar (if I understood you right)?"
0,Nelle,17,"Hi I have a fecal BB for 4 years because of poor oral hygeine but this past 2 years until now it gotten worst. I started to worry because it ain’t normal at all it smells like a shit or something so I tried so hard, I flossed 3 times and used mouthwash but its still there. But before the shitty smell I had an ulcer and uti and i heard from my friends that those are one of the reason of having bad breath so got consulted to the doctor, but i was wondering, 3 of my friends had an ulcer and uti but why does their breath doesnt smell bad?. And one of my friends doesnt took any medicines she used a herbal plant. Honestly, i wasn’t able to complete taking medicine because of lacked of money so i used herbal plant the same as what my friend used, but my fecal BB still there, but I feel better after taking it, its just the bad breath still there. I tried searching and I found out that post nasal drip can cause bad breath which I have also(sometimes I accidentally swallow it) so I followed the instruction how to get rid of this, I used baking soda, salt and water as a resolution but its still there. My friends started to laugh and whispering about my breath so I didn’t go out and hangout with them anymore. actually I thought I was the only one who had this thats why im just in my house. and I don’t have any idea how to get rid of these because even after brushing its still there. After all the research and I read some stories and their success. candida caught my attention which I’m not really familiar with. I search its symptoms and i experienced some of its symptoms like dizziness, intestinal distress, sinus infections, eczema, vaginal itching, itchy ears,craving for sweets, mood disorders, white coat on tongue and bad breath. Ive been always eating sweets, lots of sugary foods, meats, 9-15 plates of white rice per day ,junk foods and just a small amount of water ,maybe that’s why I have lots of bacteria inside me that cause my fecal BB. I started the candida diet and at firt I got sweated hard, headaches and it was crazy because i am being harsh and desparate to get cured immediately. So i decided to take it slowly, i started first the candida cleanse, this is my first day actually.By the way I have a difficulties on understanding english so I don’t know much about candida, that’s why I don’t know if what i am doing is right, as you can see my english wasnt good.My throat also and at the back of my tongue are always dry thats why a minute ago i put my index finger at the back of my tongue and the I smell of it was really really bad then I tried at the top of my tongue the smell are the same, maybe the mocus that I spit from my nose is the reason, I don’t know , please guys help me, i want to do the right and effective way of healing this. Thank you"
1,Wiley200,17,"It sounds like your bad breath is probably the result of some imbalance further down your digestive tract, i.e. not your mouth.The diet, and probiotics, should certainly help to rebalance things. Give it some time, and cut out all that sugary food, white rice, and sweets!1 user thanked author for this post.  Nelle"
2,Nelle,17,"Thank you, after the cleanse is it okay to drink coconut oil on stage 1?"
3,Determined1,17,"Hi Nelle,I had not heard of this term, FBB, but when I looked it up I saw sulfur breath and realized my family has all developed this since we all had a round of antibiotics 3 months ago. I started noticing it a couple of weeks ago. Sulphur breath and sulphur farts. Perhaps because we’re at the beginning of a candida cleanse. Perhaps it is die-off, or maybe just the smell of candida?Aside from diet, have you heard of tonsil pearls? I’ve had a few in my life. They are hard little whitish, yellowish or tannish balls that are lodged in the back of the throat. They eventually come out on their own, but they can be lodged pretty good. Get a flashlight and look in the mirror at the back of your throat. move your throat in all different ways. say ahhh. notice folds of flesh. try opening the folds. if you see any color other than pink, get it out. Find a tool. A bobby pin may be able to do it. These little chunks are putrid smelling, and once you get them out, BB problem solved…if that’s the problem."
4,Junglechicken,17,"I would get checked out for parasites.I read on another forum, that the person who had been suffering from faecel BB for years had parasites in the intestine.Get a comprehensive stool analysis done to rule this out."
5,Will,17,"The shit breath is from bacterial imbalance and toxin build up in the colon. I know because I also had this which I forgot to put in my post.I could literally rub my teeth and the smell of feces would be left on my finger.Start slow. Start taking multi-vitamins and probiotics first. Then after a week or so, you want to get on the diet and stay on it.Once your on the diet for a few weeks, try doing an actual candida/parasite cleanse. Follow up with proper diet and stay on your supplements. The bad breath will go away.Mine is hardly noticeable anymore. And only occasionally when I burp I have bad breath. Also use the baking soda toothpaste. That will help neutralize any odor.Good luck."
6,Will,17,Tonsil pearls: I always wondered what that was… I cough them up occasionally. I would say its definitely related to Candida/Parasites and toxin build up.

1,Wiley200,19,"Do you take multivitamins or B-complex? The B-vitamins will make your urine yellow. Or you could just be dehydrated, but you say you drink lots of water already!!Yellow mucus is pretty typical with a cold – probably no connection to die-off."

0,Lucylu,20,"Hi all! I used to be a (very) regular poster on this site over a year ago and have the wise advise of Able, Raster and others to thank for so much. In short, I attacked my relatively severe Candida with military force and won! I promised Able way back that I’d touch base to update everyone and give the newbies some encouragement… so here goes:- I had a wide range of symptoms that had been building for years but got very severe after having my 4th child. Lack of sleep, stress & too much white wine led to a spiralling into a state of near nervous breakdown. I felt like I couldn’t cope, has itchy rashes/ psoriasis, severe IBS symptoms, unmanageable periods and chronic PMT. I probably had other symptoms too but I’ve blocked a lot of it from my memory! Thankfully, I found a practitioner who uses a Vega Machine to diagnose allergies & intolerance and she diagnosed me with Candida. She gave me a colon cleanse powder for a “clear out” and recommended I start Udo’s 8 probiotics a week later. Luckily I didn’t stop at just that as I would never have made any progress! But I found this site and immediately started the strictest protocol. I literally did EVERYTHING that was suggested… stuck rigidly to the starting diet, took & ate all the anti-fungals I could get my hands on, took saunas/ hot baths every day, swished every morning (I think that’s what its called!! Can’t remember!) drank kefir and tried to get more sleep. I won’t go into massive detail but I basically did what it suggested in the protocol. I can’t remember my exact timeline (and probably wouldn’t post it anyway in case I misled someone with a more severe case) but I know I stayed on each phase for way over the recommended time, was extremely tentative about introducing anything new (and at the tiniest reaction I would cut it out and go back a stage). I had 2 fairly major setbacks after introducing things to fast (as in, was laid up in bed for a week with swollen painful joints, sore itchy skin & headaches) and this was more than enough to help me to be very patient and take my time. Soooooooo….. 2 years on I still avoid all yeast & all sugar (including most fruit) as well as most carbs (I’ve never been a carb lover or had a sweet tooth so these aren’t sacrifices really. When I eat out, I basically order whatever I fancy from the menu but only have a tiny portion of the carb bit. I don’t avoid savoury sauces/ gravies (unless they are obviously sweet like some chinese ones or a plum sauce on duck for example). I still drink Kefir every day and take a strong probiotic. I take The Solgar Multivit/ min (instead of all the individual ones I took for the first year) and still rotate my antifungals but in minimal doses. I include antifungal foods in my diet as much as possible but am no longer obsessed with planning my entire diet around them! I use coconut oil instead of butter still and the only bread I eat is my own oat bran/ kefir bread (yummy!). I still try to have 2 hot baths a week too. I eat organic eggs & chicken but regular other meats (I live in Ireland and buy local free range so figure that’s pretty good). My cheats – I eat a little cheese and drink white wine spritzers as a treat! (Sorry Able I know you’ll cringe when you read me admitting to that here. And yes, there may be a couple of silly readers who will think to hell with it she drinks wine, lets crack open a bottle… but I’m hoping that most will realise just how hard I worked to get to this stage and at no stage of my “treatment” faze did I have even a sip.) So basically I live a normal life, dine out regularly, enjoy a drink and am symptom free. I’m not sure if that means I’ve beaten candida because I know I still react to things like mushrooms (ate some by accident in a stew and was doubled over with cramps & trapped wind later). I don’t think you ever “beat” candida… but I think I have it under control. In that, I control the candida and not the other way round! So my advice? Please take your time, invest in really good supplements & probiotics. Do NOT cheat as you’re only cheating yourself of a decent recovery. There IS a light at the end of the tunnel and you CAN beat this. I wish someone had posted back in my early stages that if I stuck at it I would get to this stage of normalness. I literally went into a black hole thinking I would never eat out again (I live in the gourmet capital of Ireland and love my food!) or enjoy cheese & wine, albeit it in moderation. I thought I’d be eating organic eggs & only greens for the rest of my life! I do realise for those with a sweet tooth or who crave pizza’s & burgers it’s little comfort because I don’t miss them but for me… I’m there! Any questions, feel free the PM me… as I said my exact recollection is hazy so I won’t be able to tell you what doses of which antifungals in which order… or even what things I introduced first food-wise. Heartfelt thanks to Able & Raster for their help. I could kiss you both!!! (Except my husband & your wives would probably object!!). Lucylu x"

(Sorry Able I know you’ll cringe when you read me admitting to that here.) Nope, actually I didn’t. Believe it or not, I admitted the same thing myself a while back about having a small glass of wine occasionally. I figured the folks here need to know that the strict diet doesn’t have to last a lifetime. I also avoid kefir most of the time; meaning I purchase a quart of commercial kefir from the supermarket maybe once or twice a month, but like you, I still take probiotics as maintenance. I haven’t taken commercial antifungals for a long time now, and I’m still totally bummed out on rutabaga, so my only natural antifungals are Brussels sprouts, jalapenos, or fresh garlic. There are people who may pop up in this tread and claim that we’re both “still on the diet” – but don’t let these naysayers dishearten you.

6,Prizma,20,"Hi Lucylu, Thank you so much for sharing this information. Though I am a newcomer, I have had the symptoms for a long while /for approx two years/. Just circled through various doctors – gastroenthereologist for the IBS and loose stools, psychiatrist for the constant fear of diseases which appeared, endocrinologist /who diagnosed me with Hashimoto/, hairloss, allergies, etc. No one suspected Candida. So, finally, after lots of internet surfing, I did a test and it was positive. However, not a doctor warned me of the diet. So I went throught already several antifungals. Seemed there was a recovery, but in less than a month the symptoms apperade again. I am glad to have found this place. It is helpful and encouraging. I hope, even going through this two years period with no substantial recovery yet, it is not late to start and to be successful, isnt’t it?"
7,shayfo,20,"Prizma, I’m not as far along as Lucy, but I am basically symptom-free after having candida problems (on some level) for over 10 years before starting treatment. I think if you take treatment seriously and stick with it, you’ll eventually see improvement no matter how badly off you were to start."

Prizma, As Shayfo says… you really have to fight this head on and stick with it. Doctors will NOT diagnose candida and many will ridicile you for mentioning it. I had a stand up argument with my brother earlier this year and he’s one of the most respected doctors in Australia, speaks at International conferences on the latest advance in medicine… yet completely poo-poo’d my symptoms, recovery & theories. Silly of me to have ever discussed it with him! You can do this – you said you went through several antifungals but what have you been eating? If you continously kill & feed & kill & feed the candida than you’ll get stuck in an awful cycle of die off. Best of luck with your recovery – if you can get your head in the right place then your body will follow. Lx P.S. I had the symptoms for about 5 years at a moderate level and had been gradually removing things from my diet that “didn’t suit me” so I think my recovery might have been faster (in that I’d already worked out a lot of it for myself. But I’d never have got to this stage without the full strict diet and gradually reintroducing."

12,candid jo,20,"Hi Lucylu, I’ve read your update so not sure if you still come on here. I’m in ireland too and my homeopath diagnosed me with candida. I’m on a strict diet for it and have done a couple of cleanses but I still struggle sometimes with the symptoms. I do get cravings for carbs and occasionally give in to it but generally I’m good with it. I find the mental symptoms hardest to cope with, brain fog and memory trouble. I struggle with conversation at times (can’t remember the words for things) and the fatigue can be extreme. Daily life is difficult and I find my friends don’t have much patience with me because they don’t think its a real illness so I’m avoiding people more so as not to have to explain myself. I’d love to talk to someone in ireland who understands what this is like and your success story has given me some hope with persevering with it. My homeopath told me it would only take 6 weeks to sort this but I’ve had this for at least a couple of years now (probably longer). I’d love to hear from you and know how its going for you now. Thanks Jo"
0,PeteSake,21,"Hello, this will be my log of my journey.Well it all starts several months back, after waking up one day with severe throat pain, and very enlarged lymph nodes around my groin and throat (gumball sized) and penile thrush.. I was quite afraid, so I see my doctor. I had done a little research before seeing her, so I suspected it was candida related. However she seemed clueless. I had to really press the issue because she thought nothing of it and after much talking she finally prescribed me some antifungals. I would definitely say the antifungals were doing their job rapidly but I didn’t know about probiotic importance or the fact that I should abstain from sugar (I kept eating candies and snacks) and for a few more months my symptoms just never went away, even getting worse. (Some background, I’ve taken antibiotics maybe several times over the last 10 years and never was one to have probiotics ever, though I generally ate healthy diets).. also over the months my hair began to fall out in patches all over my body.At this point I researched more thoroughly and came to the candida diet site. Very helpful info by the way, thanks to everybody here! So come to find out I was doing everything wrong.. my sleeping habits, caffeine, sugar, no antifungals or probiotics.. etc. So I start to take on the candida diet, again by my mistake I didn’t research the ‘strict’ diet, but had everything else.. I’ve tried coconut flour/oil/cream, xylitol, stevia, buckwheat, oat bran, veggies, etc. What I’ve found is that most of the things I tried are not good for my current stage.Sugar I’ve eliminated completely but because of hunger pangs and high fatigue I tried the approved grains for the carbs (buckwheat, oat bran, etc.) to no avail. When I have these I felt great energy but my hands begin to dry and crack so bad that I can hardly work at my job, my hands bleed. It would also cause sever tightening pain in my small intestines (which I assume is leaky gut) and was actually the same feeling I recollect from eating excessive amounts of sugar in one sitting just about 6 months ago. Since discontinuing these it has went away. And anything that can AND will irritate candida I couldn’t have because of the horrible oral thrush. My diet for the last couple of months have been basically organic chicken/eggs/green veggies and the occasional red meat, maybe 1-2 times a week. I’m finding that the strict diet is just that.. I also have my tongue highly coated and brushing it with antifungals keeps it at bay for a day then it returns.Overall though, the last maybe 4 weeks have been the best and have seen the most improvement, my penile thrush went away first, my swollen nodes have actually gone up and down but seem overall better, my oral thrush has made maybe 30% progress and my tongue looks better everyday, maybe 40% progress. Also my hair has began to grow back.Some things I’ve found on my journey:No No’s for me..– Any sweetener (xylitol, stevia, erythritol, etc.) although they don’t do real damage IMO, they do hinder my progress – all grains, nuts, flours (Cause leaky gut and sever candida outbreaks on hands) – all fruit (Sugar goes straight to oral thrush and makes it worse, also making neck lymph modes worse) – all dairy (Again with the hands candida outbreak)I also was eating peppers but after research it seems they exasperate leaky gut so I discontinued them all.What I am having currently:– organic greens and veggies (Spinach, broccoli, green beans, green onion, onion, garlic) – raw sauerkraut (in water/salt) – olives – Braggs ACV – healthy oils (organic cold pressed, etc.) (Olive, Coconut, sesame) – antibiotic free/organic chicken – antibiotic free/free range eggs – organic grass fed beef – herbs (Basil, Rosemary, Himalayan salt, cinnamon, thyme) – filtered water – jioagulan tea (This has helped me tremendously with energy and healing) – 150 billion probiotic 40 strain 1-2/day – oil pulling 1-2/day – multivitamin 1/day – b vitamin + cal/mag throughout the day"
1,PeteSake,21,"I would add that as far as die off,I experienced it tremendously the first 3 days I took antifungals and started taking the candida diet somewhat seriously. I felt extreme brain fog, felt sick, woke up with night sweats, could hardly think or function. Work felt impossible I just wanted to go home."
2,PeteSake,21,"A couple things I’ve been noticing lately..I’ve been really trying to drink much more water because it’s been something I neglect which resulted in my urine being really cloudy/dark and foamy all the time. Well now I drink water constantly throughout the day and it quickly turns clear and loses a lot of foam, however it doesn’t take long for it to get yellow/green again.Also, with all of the water I’ve been drinking I’ve noticed that my hunger/sweet cravings have gone down tremendously.. in fact the sweet cravings are nearly non existent. I must’ve been very dehydrated this whole time.The second thing is that I’m noticing my hand outbreaks have gotten much better due to cutting out the culprits but I’m beginning to think that my probiotic is still keeping it there, I suspect this because before my large probiotic my hands didn’t do this at all.. perhaps it’s due off. Will have to keep my eye on it, but things are looking better."
3,Pharoah24,21,Hey Pete glad to see you’re taking action like myself.

Because of this I have begun to eat my veggies only warm and not cooked and have seen tremendous improvement.I’ve also found that the thrush in the back of my throat is very slow at recovery, however applying an antifungal to a q-tip and applying to the area seems to render great and quick results."
6,PeteSake,21,"As of today I’ve found a few new important things.Firstly, I slept pretty hard and long last night. (About 11 hours) And when I awoke, much of my symptoms had greatly decreased. Decreased like never before, and I even had some of my favorite oat bran oatmeal and coconut ice cream last night. Wow. I usually wake up with an extremely sore throat and hands crackly and brittle and dry. Hands were much better and throats nearly no pain. Also the thrush in the back of my throat was a lot better looking.Secondly, because of my concern with animal, I’ve decided to swap all animal sources of food with kidney beans. I will have to see how the results go. My main concern is the ammonia it causes. And I know animal meat is recommend only small portions about 3 times a week but I was eating it daily with every meal. This I shouldn’t have done but I’m happy to try and see how it is without any of it.So far today everything has been better. I feel better, hands nearly have no dryness and cracking. And throats feels a lot better and looks slightly better. It looked best when I woke up but throughout the day it began to almost look the same as it has.So note to self: Sleep A lot No animal for a while"
7,PeteSake,21,"So a few things I’ve noticed.-Eggs seem to be useful for a food item but it’s quite tempting to eat too much into high cholesterol, plus I’m trying to cut animal protein for the moment.-Anything with ‘unbound’ sugar tends to make thrush worse.-high carb foods (buckwheat, seeds/nuts, oatbran, teff, etc.) cause my hands to dry brittle and crack-started having hemp seeds which are low carb high protein and I believe they are working well.-when I wake from sleep my thrush always seems 90% better and continues to get better through the day with fasting but by the time I eat something it flares up again badly.-need to cut all know ‘instant unbound sugars’ for the moment. Focusing on plain salads with olive oil, some other veggies, and hemp seeds as a protein source.-If I don’t see improvement then I should probably swap the hemp seeds for eggs again.-I feel my dysbiosis is getting under control but the fight with oral thrush seems impossible to overcome"
8,PeteSake,21,"*Oral Thrush Test*I like to eat this porridge I make of hemp seeds, cinnamon, coconut oil, and xylitol. About a tsp-Tbsp xylitol. Today I went ahead and made the porridge as I usually do. Before I ate it I took a picture of my thrush, then took a picture about 5 minutes after eating and then again an hour later. After eating the porridge I also drank water, swishing, gargling, and rinsing all leftover residue. My thrush had significantly gotten worse, I’d say about 40% worse. 40% was overall, it didn’t seem to get much worse as the hour passed, more of an instant change. After some time had passed, I repeated the same procedure except this time I left out the xylitol. The pictures revealed no significant difference.I think I may have concluded that xylitol can make an oral thrush issue worse."
9,PeteSake,21,*Oral Thrush Test 2*So after a few hours I duplicated the test from above but this time I used stevia in the place of xylitol.Results concluded that stevia did not appear to alter oral thrush at all.
10,RiversTrini,21,Pete – Please keep up your efforts. Candida has yo yo effects. Enjoy the good days and when the bad days show up – keep thinking about the good days. I am in my 12-14 months of getting healthy. It all works. Patience is required which really reduces stress.
11,PeteSake,21,"Thank you for the kind and uplifting words, I really appreciate it."
12,PeteSake,21,"So I just went to the doctor and got another round of antibiotics, this time I plan to do it right. At the doctor they really seemed to do anything but diagnose candida. Anyways I’m scheduled for a whole host of test so maybe at least it will help me know how I’m functioning."
13,PeteSake,21,"So I’m noticing a few things…1) I’m quite certain eggs are killing my thrush instantly after eating it. I don’t know what it is but after I eat eggs, even just plain hard boiled, my thrush looks less white and surface area shrinks.2) Since I noticed that my thrush tends to die down with intermittent fasting I decide to try a slightly longer fast. And also I notice that upon waking up my thrush tends to appear at least about 80% healed, so I ate Friday, then slept, woke up and thrush looked about 80-90% better, then went all of Saturday not eating and slept and upon waking up Sunday my thrush appeared exactly the same as the previous day. This leads me to believe intermittent fasting is beneficial but nothing longer… with regards to thrush.3) I’ve been on a very strict diet of veggies, healthy fats, and either eggs or hemp seeds for protein. Perhaps I’m passed stage 1 because my digestive Candida feels quite better but my thrush hasn’t gone down so I assume I am actually not.. however, I’ve come to find that when I add a more variety of food I not only feel better and have more energy but I tend to wake up with less thrush and seem to have less thrush throughout the day, namely when I’ve added raspberries and blueberries (in small quantities). My guess is it’s the immune system boost.4) Since my diet has been so strict I’ve been in desperate need of calories so my main calories have been healthy oils. What I’ve come to find is that I think it is quite dangerous. By eating this way I feel my heart skip beats, feelings of high blood pressure and one day I noticed my veins, though popping out (because of weight loss) were really slim and small looking. By cutting the plant oils and upping other things, such as nuts and fruit I found I feel much better.5) my cutting down of carbs has been making me extra tired, fatigued, and weak, and I’ve noticed I tend to drop things all the time.. on the other hand, as I increase carbs, my dry hands get worse, quite a dilemma but I think I should lean on the side of greater overall health by having the carbs.Overall my impression is that my diet needs to be balanced as much as possible between healthy fats, proteins, raw fruits and veggies, seeds, nuts, and perhaps legumes.However my overall dry hands have gotten much better."
0,candidagonegirl,22,"Hello to anyone reading this post!On here to share my candida experience with the internet. Hoping to see if anyone has had a similar experience and if you’ve been able to cure it.I’ve been living with Candida for about 10 years. It started in my early teens with vaginal discharge. For years I thought it was just a chronic yeast infection as gynecologists would always tell me it was BV and prescribed antibiotics. Every time I went on the antibiotics, all my symptoms went away immediately (no discharge, irritation or odor) but came back as soon as the treatment was done. I stopped going to gynecologists and chose to ignore (live with) the issue feeling hopeless after so many attempts.This condition became a huge part of my life when I became sexually active. Sex is uncomfortable for me because I am always very self-conscious about the smell and discharge and the penetration can be painful. I’ve never had an orgasm and even began questioning my sexuality because of it for a while. It’s definitely affected my relationships throughout the years and consequently my self-esteem.It was only about 2 years ago that a doctor diagnosed me with candida and I understood what I had. I came across this website and decided to try the diet along with 100 billion probiotics from Amy Myers MD daily as well as Caprylic Acid and Oregano oil pills. I did this for 30 days seeing very little improvement. I got discouraged and relapsed into my regular lifestyle feeling hopeless once again. I generally eat healthy, do exercise and meditate but after 10 years of unsuccessfully trying to get rid of it, I felt like I needed a more radical approach.I have been on the candida diet for two months eating zero sugar, fruits, starch, gluten, bread, yeast, alcohol, corn, mushrooms, most grains, moldy nuts red meat, pork and dairy. I mostly eat eggs, chicken, quinoa, avocado and greens. Once in a while I’ll have a little carrot in a salad and almond or coconut flour products. I sometimes eat yogurt with green apples, cinnamon and walnuts. I’m also taking garden of life 50 billion probiotics daily. I haven’t restarted the anti-fungals because I simultaneously started a treatment for a suspected autoimmunity condition and hyperthyroidism. The nutritionist told me I should only be taking the supplements in their plan and probiotics was the only additional thing ok to take during the treatment.I finished phase one of the supplements and am starting a 10 day flush tomorrow. Once that flush is done I will resume the anti-fungals. I plan to do the diet for however long it takes. I’m just interested in hearing if anyone else with candidiasis for this long has been able to cure themselves (no chunky discharge, odor, pain during sex, fatigue, depression) with just the diet, probiotics and anti-fungals. If so, I would really appreciate sharing the following:– what did you eat specifically? – what probiotic did you take? (brand/kind) – what anti-fungals did you take? (brand/kind) – recommend anything else to add to the routine?Thank you for reading!"
1,PeteSake,22,"Hello there, I hope I can add some helpful advice.. (Although I haven’t had Candida as long as you nor have I been cured as of yet)First I’d like to ask did you start with the strict diet first? I’ve been eating pretty strict myself but have found that foods like quinoa, dairy, and even almond/coconut flour hinder my results greatly because they do contain carbs. I’ve found that animal proteins and veggies have been all I can handle (ive had candida for about 6 months).Secondly I would say that antifungals are a must.. antifungals/probiotics/no sugar/low carb diet are absolutely essential.With regards to the prescription antibiotics, they were working great on your behalf, but once they are done that is the moment to strike hard with the diet/antifungals/probiotics. If at all possible I would try and get another round before beginning again, if it were me.Remember to drink lots and lots of water! Got to flush all the toxins out.As for the sexual aspect, Candida can play a number of issues on hormones and hormones are greatly interwoven with sexuality and desire.In my opinion the best antifungals, a must have, is organic cold pressed coconut oil, plus it has healthy fats and is a great way to get those calories that seem hard to get once there isn’t so much choices of foods. Also olive oil is good. Raw garlic too, and there are a whole host of herbs (Pau D Arco tea, cinnamon..). Vitamin C is a must to strengthen your immune system during all of this as well.1 user thanked author for this post.  candidagonegirl"
2,candidagonegirl,22,"Thanks so much for this advice PeteSake!I actually had a call with my nutritionist this morning and told her about my eating habits for the past couple of weeks and she too suggested I stay away from quinoa, yogurt and any grains or carbs at all. She said I should be eating 70% vegetables (50% of those being uncooked) and 30% protein coming from chicken and seafood. I am excluding tuna, swordfish and all shellfish from that category.So tomorrow I will start my flush and supplement program which lasts 14 days. I will probably just cold press juice and eat salads. Once the flush is done, I will try going to the gynecologist one more time and going on a round of antibiotics while simultaneously taking probiotics, anti-fungals and the strict veggie + animal protein diet.I’ll send an update once I’m 30 days in!Again, if anyone can recommend a brand a probiotics that have worked best for beating the candida please let me know."
3,Wiley200,22,"I would consider getting some food-based probiotics too. Sauerkraut, plain yogurt etc – they are generally just as potent as supplements and a lot cheaper!"
0,Whatisnormal,23,"I have been suffering for more than 10 years. No doctor could pinpoint what is wrong with me and I am almost positive that candida is to blame for all my problems. On a daily basis I have to deal with -acid reflux -hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) -athlete’s foot -oily skin and acne -underweight (cannot gain a pound) -bad breath and white tongue I have been suffering for too long. I did the spit test and it came back positive. I am aware that dietary changes can help, but what are my real chances of getting rid of this parasite? How long will it take? What’s the best course of action against it? Thanks for your help in advance."
1,laurenziano,23,Best take 10000 mg of ascorbic acid a day. Its the only thing that will kill candida yeast. Read on the internet people being cured of leukemia diabetes candida yeast tuberculosis everything with 100.000 mg of ascorbic acid daily-brought back from death. It is truly the only thing I trust-read it for yourself and save yourself. Any other advice might help but ascorbic acid kills germs bacteria flu colds and candida
2,Whatisnormal,23,"First time I heard of Vitamin C being strong enough to kill candida. Thank you for your reply, any other advice is greatly appreciated."
3,RobyRob,23,Could be candida or could be something else. I would suggest you visit a functional medicine doctor and get lab tests. If you have candida it usually takes months to reduce it and then changing your lifestyle or it will come back.
4,Whatisnormal,23,It is 100% candida because I had numerous tests done as well as a (unnecessary) endoscopy to determine the reason for my acid reflux. The gastroenterologist sent me away with a recommendation to a psychiatrist to be treated for anxiety.
5,texan,23,"This happens so often. Someone dealing with a chronic condition (it doesn’t have to be Candida) can’t find a doctor who recognizes their symptoms, and so they just get sent to a psychiatrist."
6,Whatisnormal,23,"In my opinion doctors are idiots with prescription pads. Throughout the years, I have seen numerous psychiatrists (per recommendation) and have tried numerous pills with little to no help. The only thing I find useful to calm my symptoms is by medicating with marijuana (legal state.) My main symptoms are hyperhidrosis and acid reflux. If I could make those symptoms disappear my lifestyle would improve dramatically. I recently even got rejected to make love to a female because of my bad breath… and I don’t even blame her."
7,texan,23,"What kind of testing did you get to verify the candida overgrowth? The comprehensive stool analysis is generally considered the best.The hyperhidrosis, acid reflux, and bad breath can all be linked back to low stomach acid. Have you tried supplements like Betaine HCl? Or digestive bitters? If you’re taking antacids, that can make things worse. https://www.thecandidadiet.com/how-important-is-stomach-acid/"
8,Whatisnormal,23,"Thank you I will look into that. The spit test and symptoms tell me everything I need to know, except a way to cure it. I also suffer from athlete’s foot, severe anxiety and depression, oily skin, overproduction of ear wax, and the fact that I have weighed 120 pounds for the past 6 years. Any information is very helpful, thank you in advance."
9,Wiley200,23,The spit test is notoriously unreliable – https://www.thecandidadiet.com/testingforcandida.htm#SpittleYou should get the stool test to make sure. Otherwise you might be treating the wrong condition!
10,Whatisnormal,23,Most if not all of my symptoms seem to be attributed to candida. My spit is always cloudy and web-like which is a good indication that I actually have candida. There seem to be no other diseases that add up with all my symptoms.
11,Whatisnormal,23,I am honestly considering suicide at this point since there seems to be no cure for my problems and never will. I have been struggling with this shit for way too long. I would love to fall asleep forever and never wake up. Never have to deal with all the problems that keep me from living a life.
12,Wiley200,23,"Hi again. Don’t give up! You’ll figure out what’s wrong, even if it takes a little longer.Did you get the stool test? Did you go to see a functional dr?Remember that you can’t really make any diagnosis from looking at your spit. The spit test was popularized a few years back by the company that makes Threelac (a really low CFU, expensive probiotic) to boost their sales. There are proper tests that you can take, like the stool test. The ‘spit test’ is not a diagnostic test.There are lots more things to try and to investigate. You’ll get there in the end 🙂"
13,candidagonegirl,23,"Hey there! Remember our thoughts manifest themselves physically in our body and having a negative approach will only worsen your condition. I know that’s easier said than done with all the symptoms you’re experiencing and you must be thinking, who is this stranger on the internet to tell me this. I’ve actually had candida for 10 years, unable to get rid of it. It too has affected my life, self-esteem and relationships and has lead me to episodes of anxiety and depression. My candida has stripped me of a normal, healthy sex life as well and has put me in a lot of emotionally painful situations.What I do believe, after seemingly trying everything doctors have prescribed me and still not being able to get rid of it, is that there is a big portion of it that is phycological. I still am unaware of what exactly took me to this point but the truth is I haven’t done absolutely everything in my power to get rid of this.I had read that a strict diet was necessary, but until two months ago kept telling myself: “that’s impossible to follow for me. That will take too long. I travel too much and love food too much to be able to do this. There must be a pill that I can take that will remove this.” I was always looking for the easy-fix or tried doing the diet for one month and after seeing no improvement, relapsed into my regular lifestyle again. In general I don’t eat unhealthy and do lots of exercise so I think a lot of this is self-sabotage as it is much easier to complain and feel sorry for yourself than it is to do the hard work.I can’t say that this is your case, just wanted to share with you my experience with it up to this point and hopefully inspire some food for thought. Although I still have not been cured, I’m motivated and proud of myself for sticking to the plan for this long. I’m about to go two months on the candida diet and taking the probiotics daily. I have never been a very disciplined person when it comes to my personal life so keeping a diet this strict and taking a pill everyday is a step up for me. I am very driven professionally but I feel like this is the first time I have really wanted to put all this energy on myself and I hope that this time I am able to cure myself once and for all.I posted a journal as well and will update my progress as I go.Stay positive and don’t give up man! There are some many wonderful things in life to stick around for 🙂"
0,arandomguy,24,"Hey, Im from Europe , sorry for bad english. So the story starts in June, 2017. I ate a chocolate with my friends, which had medical weed in it. When the effect stopped, i felt very very dizzy, i thought i am gonna die, my heart beated like so fast. Next day, i felt very dizzy, i took a multivitamin and magnesium, and the next day i felt 100% nice.(maybe because i had been on died for 2 months, no sugar, white thing etc.) So i thought maybe my bode dont like weed or i dont now. Months later, i had a party, and i drank about half a liter of vodka, for empty stomach. And from that time i feel that same dizziness,tiredness, brain fog etc.I went to lot of blood tests, and all of them were negativ, only i have a little bit of underactive thyroid.I did the candida test yesterday(the split test) and it dipped like a stone in water. So its positive. Could it be it? Please help.Where should I start the diet? Thank you 🙂"
1,arandomguy,24,That vodka thing was about in september.
2,Wiley200,24,"The spit test is super unreliable and not a real diagnostic tool.I don’t really see any other indications that you have candida, like digestive problems or yeast infections. There could be any number of reasons why you’re tired, and the underactive thyroid might be a part of it. I would focus on that.1 user thanked author for this post.  arandomguy"
3,arandomguy,24,"thanks for your reply. if course, i have more indicatorts that i have read online, but i didn’t wanted to list them all.I have a white tongue too. I have had been to a cardiologyst for a lot of times, but nothing luckly. With any infection like lyme it was negative.And when it started(the dizziness and the typical candida symptoms) my thyroid was overactive a little bit. So the doctor was surprised a little bit, cause she thought it is underactive thyroid.I read that Candida could mess with your thyroid too.I have been to psychologist too(but i didn’t wanted to to because i dont belive in it, and i have no problem in my life)but she totally didn’t found anything bad. i am farting all day. So after all, what do you think?"
0,jv01,25,"After suffering from various symptoms (brainfog, extreme mental fatigue, always cold & loose stool) for more than 10 years, I started a candida diet in the hope this would relieve some of the symptoms. In week 2 (so the first week after the detox week) I felt much better than ever before and had high hopes I was on the right track. But I’ve been on my candida diet for 5 months now and although my symptoms are less, they’re still present. I follow the candida diet strictly in combination with supplements (Molybdenum Glycinate, Lumbrokinase, probiotics, oregano oil, coconut oil, etc) and think it’s weird that after so many months there is no real result to show for yet. Is this normal? Did anybody else experience this?Any advice would be greatly appreciated!Thanks"
1,Wiley200,25,"It’s pretty common for Candida to co-exist with other health problems, for example thyroid issues or adrenal fatigue.What symptoms do you still have? Are they digestive? Or are they more fatigue etc?It could be that you’ve repaired your gut health but still have some hormonal imbalances or other problems that developed over the years of poor gut health and weakened immunity."
2,jv01,25,"Interesting to read it was common other health problems could co-exist with Candida. I have digestive issues (very loose bowel movement), but also brainfog, extreme mental fatigue, always cold and I’m always thirsty. Before going the candida route, I thought I had thyroid issues, but a full thyroid panel test (TS3, TS4, TSH, etc) came back normal. After suffering for more than a decade, I feel I’m getting closer to finding relief from my symptoms, but the puzzle pieces aren’t falling in place yet 🙁Thank you so much for your reply!"
3,zyzy,25,"Hey I hope you’re better. How are you doing now? I have severe brain fog and mental issues and burping and gas, mild pelvic pain, fatigue. Also tingling sensations in my body like something is moving mostly my bottom, back, front side of neck. But the BRAIN FOG IS EXTREMELY BAD. I feel like I don’t know who I am anymore and I can’t remember what a normal life feels like."
4,RobyRob,25,It’s possible you will never get rid of the problem completely. That is my experience.
5,Rob,25,"Hi JV01,I think the candida diet helps but will never cure it on its own, at least not quickly. I’ve tried to beat candida in the past by doing zero carbs and taking supplements orally. I never made significant progress and eventually gave up after a couple of months.The progress I’ve made recently is by doing nystatin enemas. In just 2 weeks, I feel like a different person. Literally, 100% more energy. Hair loss has stopped. Tingling in hands and feet has nearly gone (I’ve realised this is die off). Itchy scalp practically stopped. Bloating massively down. The trick is to clean out the colon with water enemas (4-8 litres in multiple rounds) and then a nystatin/curcumin retention enema all the way to the cecum if you can. This way the nystatin hits the candida in sufficient concentrations and kills it on impact. You can buy nystatin powder from Fludan, however if you’re based in the US or Canada (I’m UK-based), I understand you’ll have an easier time getting it prescribed by a doctor."

Nothing seemed to work and no one could really tell me what it was. They kept upping the doses of medicine but nothing happened. For a month it dissappeared but it came back because my doctor prescribed me new birthcontrol without telling me this could be bad. I kept searching for help and no one could help me. After googling I found this site and decided to give it a shot if nothing else helped, and im now about three weeks in.The yeast infection is the only real sympthom I have and the only thing I care about getting ride of. Still nothing happened. I didnt do the detox thou, because Im very skinny and are terrified of loosing weight. Otherwise I kept strict to the diet and trying to find remedies here in Europe that could work as well as the one I read about here.My problem is I’m starting to get really depressed. I feel like this is giving me nothing to live for. I can’t have sex with my boyfriend since I have pain almost every day and even thou he’s very sweet about it It’s killing me. A year without sex is a really long time for a couple.. I’m under 25 and my life is traveling, partying, eating out and enjoying the stuff I want to do. Now I can’t do anything and I’m so worried that this wont go away, and if It does that I wont ever be able to go back to my old lifestyle.I’m just depserate for any tips, stories or whatever that this is just a small amount of time in my life and that I will be able to go back to my normal life. Because staying on the candidadiet for a long time is not an option for me. That is not a way I can possibly live my life. I just want to be normal again.//Aka"
1,zarina,27,"I know, me too. Hugs to you, I hope you find something that works"
2,Seashell,27,"To start off – I feel you. I’m under 25 and supposed to be having the time of my life, I had recurring yeast infections for about a year before I went on the diet, my relationship with my boyfriend and my self esteem has taken a big turn due to us not being able to have a healthy sex life. I’m currently transitioning out of the diet and I’ve been infection free for about four, almost five months so I will try to help you.Do you take antifungals/probiotics? This will help you to get rid of the infection. And when choosing probiotics, keep an eye out for how many billion viable cells per capsule they contain, there’s no use in spending money on probiotics that have next to no effect.When it comes to sex, my tips is instead of him entering you, experiment with other kinds of sex, like oral and just touching each other. This is a way to have some kind of sex life when penetrative sex is impossible due to the pain. DO NOT have sex if you feel pain, it will only make your infection worse and you could develop chronic pain when having sex (I unfortunately did, and TRUST ME you do not want to get that…)Actually, are you sure your infection is the only thing causing pain? If you’re in pain everyday (not itching and burning, but actual pain) it could be possible that you’ve developed some form of Vulvodynia. I would see an ob-gyn if I were you, if only to confirm that the infection if your only problem.As someone who made it through and is starting to transition back – let me tell you, it has been so worth it. My sex life still isn’t good, but the first time you sucessfully have sex again, the first time you go out to a restaurant, the first pizza you order home… It’s incredible to be able to have that again. You will appreciate it so much more. And if you find that you trigger the infection again or feel some kind of discomfort, you just take a step back and try to eat healthy again. Trial and error. I’m confident that you can get through this! If you have any questions I’d be happy to answer them, we who have those problems have got to stick together and help each other. 🙂"
3,hollyweird666,27,"Does anyone of you have an IUD put in? Because I was like you, the only thing I had problem with was the constant vaginal problems, I had itchiness, burning and constant brown shit and wetness coming out of my vagina, I was only “good” for a few days a month. I tried the Candida diet but it was way to hard for me so I decided to just take the IUD out and immediately I felt like a new person! No problems whatsoever! The only downside is that you have to use condoms instead, but it’s worth it! I have also tried pills and stuff before and that doesn’t work either, it seems like everything you take or put in to your body as a women not to get pregnant will give you some bad symptoms if you’re sensitive. Try to be completely clean of all those things and see what happens. It’s very annoying to me that the gynecologists don’t say to stop the birth control and use condoms but instead just give antibiotics every time you get a heist infection, that will only make it worse!"
4,Seashell,27,"I had a copper IUD put in 7 months after the infection started, and I don’t think it had anything to do with it at all. I’ve heard before about people with IUD’s having trouble with yeast infections, but it just wasn’t a factor in my story. I still have it in me and have been infection free for 4, almost 5 months (where I’ve started to transition back to a normal diet in the last month). A copper IUD is really the best option for me since any kind of contraceptive with hormones makes me very depressed."
5,luiza,27,"Make sure candida is the only infection, am sure you’ve had tests but sometimes candida persists if there is another pelvic infection. Also, maybe a stool culture for candida? if you have heavy candida in stool then that could also suggest the reason for recurrent infection. Vaginal pH is important (avoid douches, avoid latex underwear, the pill and pregnancy also change this) and use lube in any penetrative sex however mild to avoid chronic pain (vulvodynia). I suspect you’ve tried/ eliminated all of the above but thought it may be useful. Also general health – stress, smoking, diabetes, other infections, lack of sleep – all of these suppress your immune system and cause candida overgrowth.All the best."
6,laurenziano,27,I WILL TELL YOU AND ALL YOU POOR GIRLS GOING THROUGH THIS. A VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION IS A YEAST INFECTION. THE INFECTION IS THE YEAST-THE YEAST YOU PUT IN YOUR BODY IN BREAD DONUTS PIZZA SUBMARINE SANDWICHES IS FULL OF YEAST INFECTION. GOD SAID DO NOT EAT LEAVENED BREAD OR BREAD WITH YEAST.

7,Kadambari,27,Hi. I have been at your place and no longer get vaginal infections. My doctor recommended Gentian violet solution that I applied with an earbud carefully twice a day. I was cured. It is cheap and effective.
8,coconut,27,"I have had a vaginal yeast infection for 10 months now. I was misdiagnosed as having eczema so i was not able to treat it immediately. I was also very bloated and gasy. I would get bad hangovers after drinking alcohol. I took a diflucan which reduced my symptoms immediately within 24 hr but did not cure me and after a week the yeast infection continued. So i started the candida diet and follow it strictly. I also dont eat low sugar fruit because i am scared that it may not be good for the candida. I eat 50 billion probiotics, coconut milk kefir, capryllic acid , a homopathic antifungal , vitamins. I am also doing a liver cleanse since last week that has milk thistle etc. the dr gave me another 3 diflucans to take every other day in the beginning of my diet. it has been 6 weeks now and i still have itching and burning. My gas and bloating has stopped but i am very constipated. How much longer do i have to continue this diet??!! I am stressed out and becoming depressed and loosing weight."
9,Banshee,27,"For the vaginal infection, I’ve found that boric acid suppositories speed up healing significantly. I did them nightly for 14 days. Combined with the rest of this program, it seems to have worked.My biggest frustration is healing the external irritation. It’s taken me up to three months for that too to go away, but eventually it did. Calendula gel helps soothe, even if just for a little relief.It definitely sucks, and treatment is a real commitment, but it will heal up eventually. And the diet will get easier too – it will take time, but it’s not forever."
10,Banshee,27,"As for the constipation, consuming more vegetables, fewer nuts, and more water may help. I have easily gotten into the habit of filling up on nuts and nut butters, which are very binding. It’s easy to do on such a restricted diet.Avocado and coconut milk are both very filling and much more agreeable. I’ve also come to love vinegar-free olives for a ready-to-eat and portable snack. Edamame is another favorite of mine.I’ve never been much of a soda drinker, but will also note that making my own iced herbal tea has been a sneaky way to up my water consumption as well 🙂"
0,warmwaters,28,"Hello everyone,has anyone here experienced/experience bad breath from candida? It is a burden to deal with that’s why I started the candida diet since I seem to suffer from a lot of it’s symptoms including bad breath, the worse of them all! It has been a month since I started the candida diet, I am still holding on to a strict vegan diet with probiotics and anti-fungals but have yet to see a change in my bad breath and tongue thrush. At first I questioned if it was even candida but during the first two weeks of intense die-off, my breath and thrush were so much worse leading me to believe that candida is indeed the culprit. Has anyone here have experienced bad breath? Any advice or success stories? Thank you!"
1,Wiley200,28,"Bad breath usually comes from the stomach or gut, not the mouth. When you make changes to your gut flora, i.e. trying to bring it back into balance with the candida diet and probiotics, these changes can result in some short term symptoms. Bloating, gas, bad breath.. they should be short term and pass pretty quickly as the good bacteria start to repopulate your immune system.2 users thanked author for this post.  iielokaria,  warmwaters"
2,warmwaters,28,"thank you for always taking the time to reply. I added Betaine HCL to my list of supplements about a week ago and my bloating symptoms have nearly vanished, sometimes very minimal bloating flares up but it is next to nothing. I know there really is no time frame for candida since all of our bodies are different, but you seem to be very knowledgable about the topic. How much time into the diet do you think I should start seeing results in my breath just based on your knowledge? Or for all the bad bacteria to be gone? Thank you!"
0,zyzy,29,"Sorry for spamming but I started a topic and can’t find it. Is this Candida? 24yo/male. I’ve had stomach problems for a while, nothing major. 3 years ago after a stressful situation my stomach got quite bad took some meds from the doctor, ate better and things got better but not back to before. Constipation and burping a lot stayed. Also I’ve had rash/eczema(not sure what the difference is) for about 6 years, on and around my nose and on my chest. About a year and a half ago I started doing a ketogenic diet for weight loss and stayed on and off until november december last year I did a Zero carb diet and after stopping is where all the trouble started. After a month of Zero Carb dieting I stopped and binged. I started feeling tired and getting mild pain on both sides of my back, it kinda felt like being cut but it wasn’t quite painful, it was just there. After 2 weeks I went for an endoscopy and colonoscopy which were all fine except I had inflammation in stomach. After the colonoscopy and endoscopy I started getting migraines/headaches and feeling tired, also had neck pain, back pain, foot, fingers, palm pain. After 2 weeks I thought I had gluten sensitivity so I went on a ketogenic diet with the aim of not eating gluten. After 1 day I woke up the next morning feeling fine like it was magic, also the rash/eczema on my face was mostly gone. I stayed on the diet for about 2.5 months where I was fine except twice I got very sick for like 2 days but I stayed on the diet and was fine after that. After 2.5 months I stopped the ketogenic diet but stayed gluten free. After about 1 week I started feeling a bit tired but nothing major. I ate gluten to see if I would react but nothing happened. I started eating anything and got more and more tired. I tried going gluten free dairy free sometimes I felt better but at night I’d start to feel tired. Anyways after a few months of experimenting with gluten, dairy, and sometimes just eating anything for some time I thought I’ll just do the ketogenic diet and feel fine again(at the same time I found out about candida) but I didn’t feel fine and now a few months after alternating between low carb and eating anything I’m pretty bad.SYMPTOMS My worst symptom is brain fog, fatigue, I feel like I don’t know who I am, like I lost my mind. I feel like I’m not alive. Can’t go to university or out in general. Depression, anxiety are pretty bad as well. I have rashes/eczema on my face and chest, sometimes on neck and stomach(mostly not itchy). Bloating, constipation, burping. Recently I started to feel things moving on my back.(worms?) I also have what feels like kidney pain as well."
1,Wiley200,29,"Have you considered doing a stool test to find out for sure?To me, it sounds like stress might be one of the underlying causes of your condition. That’s what started it initially, and is perhaps behind some of your current symptoms.What meds did your doctor give you for your stomach? If they were antacids, that can certainly contribute to a Candida overgrowth or some other bacterial dysbiosis."
2,zyzy,29,"Thanks for replying. I had stomach issues before but they were mild and I would get diarrhea every once in a while. I really dont know what meds the doctor gave me. My stomach issues are bad but the brain fog and fatigue are horrible. I feel I’m not fully conscious of the things I do. As I said I had stomach issues for a while but the brain fog/fatigue started after going off a Zero carb diet that I did for a month. Then I did a ketogenic diet and I instantly felt better. Then I stopped and kept getting worse with time. Will the stool test show candida as I’ve done stool tests a few times more than a year ago and they all came back normal except one came with calprotectin 110 and the normal range was 0-50. Did a colonoscopy which showed nothing.(I had stomach issues at the time but no brain fog/fatigue) Now I have what feels like kidney pain on both sides after kinda following thecandidadiet for 5 days. I’m taking a liver supplement which has milk thistle, dandelion, and other herbs, I will be taking yucca stalk supplement and stinging nettle leaf extract supplement as well soon. Is that enough to handle the die off?."
3,Wiley200,29,"It sounds to me like you’re bouncing around between different diets and treatments without a solid idea of what’s really going on.Try to find out what your doctor gave you for your stomach issues. Also, get your stool tests and look to see if they tested for Candida or other pathogens. Write down a history of your symptoms and treatment. One you get everything together in one place, you can start eliminating possible conditions and get closer to the truth."
0,pussycat76,30,"Hi there, I’m writing on behalf of my husband. We don’t even know if he is definitely suffering with candida. He is having persistent night time itching all over his body. Rashes on his genitals, neck, chest and back. He is now following a strict diet in case it is candida. We have also sent his stool and saliva sample away to a laboratory to get tested for candida. He’s not sleeping at night which is torture. He does have a few symptoms of candida but there are quite a few he doesn’t have. Is there anyone on here that suffers with these symptoms too. I’m so worried about him, he’s at the end of his tether and I fear for health. Thank you for any help xx"
1,Wiley200,30,Have you tried applying coconut oil topically? The low-sugar diet should also help. But it will be really interesting to see what results the stool test show. Let us know when you get them!
0,Cedar1313,31,"For the last six months I have been plagued by stomach issues, bouts of low blood pressure, tachycardia and even heart palpitations. First determined I was experiencing histamine intolerance which was cause some of the issues (was eating spinach from my garden twice a day). Start taking DAO enzyme and eating fresh pea sprouts which also have DAO enzyme to break down histamine. Felt okay but then start having strange symptoms when I tried to work out, felt like a respiratory virus. After six weeks I still had issues and got the idea to go on the candida diet. I also want to mentioned I have been on thyroid hormone for the last 2 1/2 years and it was getting worse. After two days on the strict candida diet I started to get tachycardia so I dropped my hormone dose in half. I then started take anti-candida herbs: garlic, oil of oregano, caprylic acid, Pau D’Arco and grapefruit seed oil. On the friday I started experiencing massive die off (felt like a bad hangover), took molybdenum, vitamin C and other anti-oxidants, activated carbon and drank lots of water. Felt better on Saturday and okay by Sunday. Now I have my full energy back and feel great. Think the candida was amplifying all my allergic responses and made mild allergies feel like a respiratory virus. Note: still on half my thyroid dose and feel fine. Think the candida caused my thyroid issues to begin with, provoked an auto-immune reaction. Will continue the diet but slowly adding fruit back in. will still take the anti-candida supplements until they are gone. Will avoid sugar and sweeteners. Taking a top rate probiotic now. Funny thing is my father has been treating patients for candida for 35 years, I never thought I would get it."
1,Wiley200,31,"Candida uses biofilms to protect itself and is typically quite difficult to eliminate or reduce. It makes long term changes to your gut flora that are difficult to correct. It is very adaptable, and has effects on your immune system, adrenals etc that can take a long time to reverse. Honestly, I don’t think you could possibly have treated a Candida overgrowth in a week. It was likely something else."
2,Cedar1313,31,"I disagree. I am actually a scientist who perform experiment for a living and have been treating this like an experiment. Going over everything I have tried in the last six months the only things that can explain everything is Candida. Cannot explain how I can go from barely being able to work out to biking 4 hours last weekend plus weight training every day for the week in just two week with the only change being diet. I guess everyone’s Candida experience is different. I think I have been battling for at least 3 years but I had many good things going: healthy diet, daily probiotic and the fact that my morning coffee/chocolate used to have a laxative effect on me system which resulted in nothing staying in my system long. Unfortunately my love of chocolate, beer, wine and cocktails provided the occasional sugar intake. Going on the low histamine diet resulted in slowly of my system, allowing things to stay in me longer and candida to thrive. Felt great to start but then miserable. I went on a very hard core regiment of diet and anti-candida supplements and at least killed off most of it. Die off was brutal. Yes, it may take months to totally get rid of it, but with no sugar, good probiotics and the supplements, it will no longer make me feel miserable."
3,Noturbo,31,"I agree it sounds like something other than Candida to me. Maybe it was a food intolerance/alergy and thats why the diet helped. Changing the diet like that will not cure Candida in 2 weeks. Probably not atall on its own. Candida is much much more complicated than that. Plus your symptoms dont scream “Candida” to me. Glad the diet fixed your problem though, no matter what it was atleast youve found the solution 🙂"
4,Noturbo,31,"Infact it sounds more like a gluten alergy to me. People sensitive to gluten will experience heart palpitations like you describe, along with low blood pressure and extreme fatigue. Obviously the poor digestion too. Im pretty sure you have a gluten alergy as the symptoms are bang on and it would explain why the diet healed your symptoms so quick. Look it up and see if thats maybe more likely. Maybe test yourself by eating some gluten rich foods and seeing if your symptoms flare up. If they do then theres your answer and you know how to prevent any issues frkm here on. Goodluck 🙂"
5,Cedar1313,31,"Was tested for gluten intolerance and not an issue. Started adding pasta back in my diet and even the occasional beer or two. In the last four weeks I have felt the best I have in months and they only things I changed was no sugar and limited fruit and daily anti-yeast supplements plus a new probiotic: BlueBiotic Ultimate Care. I even drink alcohol about the same but only with water and fresh lemon. Lifting weight daily and weight daily 4 hours aerobic exercise a weeks. My bowel movements are back to normal. As I said I think the fact that my intestines used to flushed themselves out every morning with copious watery stool plus a high fiber diet and daily probiotic kept the candida in check. It wasn’t until I eliminated histamine foods and my bowel movements slowed down, did I start having serious issues but that was only for 4 weeks. Turns out the heart palpitations may have more to do with my hiatal hernia/gas pressing on the vagus nerve."
6,Cedar1313,31,"WHo knows but all I know is that after months of trying to figure out what was happening to me, I am finally feeling great. The only thing I changed in my life was eliminated refined sugar, most sweet fruit and added anti-yeast supplements. I still drink the same but mostly vodka with water/fresh lemon and the occasional beer. The one thing that I thing kept candida from doing too much damage was that for the last few years every morning after coffee/chocolate I would have copious watery stool, flushing my system out. Nothing stayed in my system more that 18 hours. I normally eat extremely healthy high fiber diet with a daily probiotic which limited the candida to the occasional burst of sugar. However, after I eliminated histamine foods from my diet, my bowel movements slowed down, then I started having serious issues. But that was only for 4 weeks. I still think a protein/veggie diet combined with garlic, oil of oregano, caprylic acid, Pau D Arco and grapefruit seed oil and a good quality probiotic will do it. I have switched to the Blue Biotics Ultimate Care."
7,Noturbo,31,"Im really glad you feel better, thats awesome. You say youre adding beer in already? 😮 i dont think ill ever drink again lol. Any lager type drink for me over the years of having Candida has reacted horribly in my stomach. I think youre right about slow digestion making things worse, I have terrible constipation and have to use castor oil to help. Also you say you avoided “most” fruit. What fruit did you keep eating? Id love to know what you managed to keep because im vegan and love fruit. I will have to look into better probiotics too. I live in the uk and used holland and barretts own brand and it did nothing. Might try the milk test on whatever I try next."
0,bloupbloup,32,"I write here because that’s the only website that is not pro green tea to recover from Candida.While many websites talk about the antioxidant and the polyphenols in the green tea, it does not mean this has a good effect on people’s body. I know that caffeine isn’t good for me. I think about caffeine in Coffee and also coke light (for sure I have stopped soda a long time ago) but I have been able to identify that caffeine was a problem.Now, I think it is the same for tea. I drink 6 to 8 mugs of green tea since 5 years and I just stopped. It’s been 1 year that I have stopped coffee, alcohol. I am on a low carb diet. 6 months after I stopped, I felt really bad.I still had bad explosive diarrheas with pain in the belly.The theine gives me the same effect than drinking coffee. I have read that some people answer the question of stopping tea by saying: “Can we drink caffeine free?”. It is easy to stop tea. They should try to stop tea and that’s it because I am not sure there aren’t other compounds in green tea that aren’t good for candida sufferers.More importantly, without green tea, I have strong die off too. In other words, I have the feeling that green tea does not do anything at all.Consequently, I wonder if green tea is just really bad for candida sufferers."
1,Wiley200,32,"If your adrenals are really weak, then even a small amount of caffeine can make you feel jittery, anxious. As well as having all kinds of other effects on your digestion, immunity etc. Green tea does contain theanine which balances out the effects of the caffeine to some degree, but yes I think it’s best to avoid it."
2,bloupbloup,32,"For your information, I have tested a green tea with less theine in it, called bancha and the result was the same. I felt weak and tired. After I stopped drinking tea, I have found that my fatigue stabilized.Quite interestingly, when i stopped to drink coffee, i had the same result. fatigue started to stabilize."
0,nkrajsa,33,"I’m just a little over a week into my diet and my symptoms only seem to be getting worse. My biggest and most debilitating symptom is vaginal itching and burning. I used to be able to get through the day using topical ointments to manage the symptoms, but for the past eight days I’ve had to reapply every two hours just so I don’t go crazy. Other symptoms include tingling in legs and arms, involuntary ticks, sore lymph nodes, ring in ears and acid reflux. I want to believe that this is just the die off happening but I’m nervous that since I’m not seeing any changes that the treatment is not working. I am taking anti-fungals and probiotics every morning so am frustrated that i haven’t started to see any improvement yet.Am i being impatient? Has anyone else gone through painful die off symptoms for an extended period of time that lasted more than a week? I have been dealing with candida for over a year now and am becoming extremely frustrated so any input would be greatly appreciated!"
1,Wiley200,33,Have you tried backing off the anti-fungals to see if those possible die off symptoms subside?
0,curtlain,34,"Hello everyone,I discovered I was suffering from candida a few years ago. I went on the anti-candida diet for six months and felt amazing after just three. I had so much energy, it was unbelievable…I lost weight, I had energy to exercise, my mood improved. I then gradually slipped back to my old habits and now I’ve been unwell for months. I’ve decided to start again and after a week of gradual detoxing I’m back on the journey :-). I have to say I feel quite excited about it. I’ll keep checking in here as I feel being accountable makes it easier for me to stick to it, especially in the first few weeks. So, here goes :-). Day 1."
0,kabes,35,"Hi! I wanted to share here, because this diet has changed my life, helped my relationship and even improved my children’s lives!!For the last four years (me) and two years (my husband), we have been feeling not quite right – I’ve been lacking in energy, putting on weight, feeling itchy and getting blocked sinuses. My husband had it far worse – he got severe pelvic, leg and foot pain, to the point where he was barely able to work, let alone do anything after work apart from lie on the sofa. With two young children, this was so sad for him, and us all.I did a lot of reading for my own symptoms, and then when he started being ill for his. I had always had my suspicions that I may have been suffering from candida, but had not found a diet that I could work with. Many asked for lots of expensive supplements, others were so complicated they were impossible to follow.About three months ago, I came to the conclusion that we could be suffering the same thing, I read somewhere that pelvic pain or prostatitis could be caused by candida and had an “Aha!” moment. Honestly by then, my husband had tried and been tested for so many things, seen so many specialists, he was desperate enough to make any change to his diet that might help his terrible condition.I started straight away with the Candida diet – fully committing to the cleanse (longest week of my life) and then got so excited to be on comparatively varied foods, for the following weeks. I took all the suggested natural remedies too. In fact, I stuck to it, like I had never stuck to any other diet in my whole life. Somehow, doing this, for my own health, seemed like a no brainer. I did feel tired and weak the first week but within two weeks, I had started feeling better, in fact all my symptoms reduced or just went away.My husband decided to go for it, not doing the cleanse (he has a full on job, and knew he wouldn’t be able to operate safely on the cleanse foods) but starting with everything else a couple weeks after me. Within a week, he noticed his pain levels were lowering significantly. Now more than a month on, I can truly say he is nearly back to his old self. We have fun with the kids again, he goes out to yoga (unthinkable two months ago) he plays basketball. He just does everything he used to do. But best of all, he is smiling and happy again because his health is back!As for me, I can feel extremely grateful that my cravings for sugar have gone, I’m full of energy, and have none of the other weird but irritating symptoms I was suffering from. Oh and I lost 7lb too!Next week will be my day 60. I can honestly say I haven’t cheated on this diet, despite eating out, going to friends and a vacation (that was hard!) What’s the point in cheating when you know the only winner is the Candida?Having a partner also on this diet has been just the best thing – we plan our food together, and when one of us is feeling weak and wants to get something off diet to eat, the other one can be strong and say “Don’t do it!” We will continue with this diet until my husband’s symptoms are completely gone. With the progress he has made so far, I would think this will be in a few months. But for now, I’m happy to keep trying all the fun recipes, challenging my husband (and kids!) to try new and weird things and get healthier every day!"
1,Jaumeb,35,I also suffer from CPPS. Keep us updated about the progress of your husband.
2,kabes,35,"Huge sympathies Jaumeb its an awful condition. Here’s to a similarly successful recovery for you. I cannot emphasise enough how great the candida diet has been for him. I will keep updating regularly.By the way, I should add, that about the time my husband decided to try the Candida Diet, we got an appointment with an Integrative Physician. They look at your whole health, not just treating symptoms and often offer more natural remedies. He wasn’t sure if it was Candida, thought it might be a food intolerance but he ran a whole range of blood and urine tests to check. In the mean time we started the diet and waited for the test results. By the time the results came back showing it was Candiasis (it took about two weeks), he was already feeling so much better. The IP was extremely impressed with my husband’s progress – he said he looked like a different man – and that I had made the right diagnosis:) My husband plans to have lab tests done when he feels fully recovered, to try to see if the Candiasis is totally eliminated from his system."
3,Jaumeb,35,Was that a stool culture? I tested positive for candida overgrowth in a stool culture.
4,kabes,35,No – blood tests and urine sample.
5,Jaumeb,35,Both? Who performed those tests? Was it a mainstream lab and mainstream doctor or something more alternative?
6,kabes,35,"Yes both. The Lab tests were done by The Great Plains Laboratory, Inc. The test was called Organic Acids Test – Nutritional and Metabolic Profile. He also ran tests with Meridian Valley Lab called the E95 common food panel."
7,Jaumeb,35,"Thanks. I did the OAT at Great Plains back in 2009. My results came back negative, probably because I was on a very low carb diet back then."
8,laurenziano,35,You have moderate Candida yeast overgrowth. Thank god because you don’t how bad it can get like diahrrea 15 times a day where you can’t go to work or pay your bills. Lots of people like that. Congratulations on getting lab tests because 1.7 billion people in world according to topic diahrrea news have your problem and worse. It’s been revealed to me that bread yeast is the #1 cause of those 1.7 billion people. Yeast doesn’t bother them until it becomes yeast overgrowth and then DIAHRREA starts. White tongue. Colds which is the body getting rid of yeast or mucous. Cut out bread it is your #1 enemy and plague on the earth. God sais DO NOT EAT LEAVENED BREAD. THAT’S WHY. EAT BREAD BUT NOT LEAVENED BREAD. So easy to make your own bread and pizza. Lots of non yeast recipes on the internet. Do your family a favour and learn how to make unleavened bread for them. 1.7 billion people are eating yeast bread and 1.5 million die every year because of yeast. We have been conditioned to eat yeast bread.white bread for the kids sandwiches. Bread every day for supper is yeast overgrowth or CANDIDA YEAST OVERGROWTH.
9,hellosummers,35,"Hi Kabes, good to hear that you were successful in your candida cleanse! What did you use to detoxify during this time? Also did you notice changes in your tongue coating from when you started to when you finished the cleanse?"
0,whitetigress,36,"I just got done reading the forum on how mold can affect the growth of candida in your body by weakening your immune system. I found this very interesting because about a year ago we were living in a home that had black mold in it but we had no idea until after 6 months of living there. It was a cheap rental house that my husband, my 4 month old daughter and I lived in. We kept experiencing cold-like symptoms but couldn’t understand why. Well then those cold symptoms led to excruciating joint pain, memory loss, brain fog, loss of cognitive abilities, chronic fatigue, depression, and yeast infections. After reading The Ultimate Candida Diet, there is not doubt in my mind that my symptoms from the Black Mold and Candida went hand in hand. My husband and daughter didn’t develop it too bad, just a simple oral thrush, and it went away fairly quickly on it’s own. Mine, however, didn’t respond well to ANYTHING. My first reaction to it was to start trying homeopathic remedies that I came across on the internet, like hydrogen peroxide, garlic cloves, and apple cider vinegar. The hydrogen peroxide made it MUCH worse. I felt like it spread further up into my body because I had horrible cramping. It really scared me and so I immediately stopped trying that method. Then I tried inserting garlic cloves inside me. I didn’t mind smelling like garlic (my husband and I love that smell) but that didn’t do anything at all. So I tried inserting a tampon of straight apple cider vinegar. I must have tough skin or something because it didn’t really burn all that much, or maybe it’s my grandma’s voice in the back of my head saying “if it burns that means it’s working!” Well, that seemed to help. My husband and I also swished apple cider vinegar around in our mouths and swallowed it to get rid of the oral thrush. That seemed to work, but it also took forever! This yeast infection was harder to deal with than any past yeast infection that I or anyone else I knew had ever had! Well, I guess I can thank the Black Mold for that! So, I thought that my problems were gone because I didn’t have anymore itching. Wrong! It seemed as though it switched to bacterial vaginosis instead! This might have also been due to a hormonal imbalance because I had just had a baby and I was still breastfeeding. I did also get pregnant during all of this as well. For the longest time, I didn’t know that I had any problems because I didn’t really have any symptoms. I had some discharge, but I thought this was due to pregnancy and it didn’t really have much odor to it. Well, I found out that I wasn’t pregnant for some of this, just had similar symptoms because of the mold and candida. Almost a year later my discharge got even heavier and I realized that this wasn’t just from pregnancy (I did actually get pregnant a little further down the line). We were living in a different home now that was mold free, thank God! I didn’t know it was bv so I treated it as a yeast infection. I got a 3 day treatment from the store. I expected it to go away as the last yeast infection, but it didn’t. So I tried the 7 day treatment. Still no results. Then I noticed later that my discharge smelled less like yeast and more like fish. So I started to try and treat it as a bv infection. I did a little research and people said that apple cider vinegar worked for them. I tried the tampon, but that area was just too sensitive from the infection to shove a hard, blown-up tampon up there. So I tried shallow douching. Still no results. My midwife suggested making little inserts from coconut oil and tea tree oil. I did this and experienced some relief, but then I got a yeast infection the day after i tried it! I continued to do the inserts and the itchy symptoms subsided. But now, my discharge was no longer fishy but smelled more like yeast! So I started some probiotics in combination with this. Didn’t work. I tried a Ph balance from Refresh in combination with probiotics and inserts. Still nothing. Then I developed oral thrush in addition. UUUUGGGHHH!! JUST GO AWAY ALREADY!!! So here I am, nearing the end of my pregnancy and I’m starting to get desperate. If I don’t do something soon this baby is going to get all this bad bacteria and yeast as it passes through the birth canal and as a result may develop chronic problems because of it. I’m NOT going to take antibiotics and kill off all the good bacteria that I have been trying to get into my body. I know detox can be harmful to the baby because of the toxins that are released from your body and from the Candida as it dies off, but which is worse? The baby potentially developing chronic problems because of the lack of good flora and an abundance of Candida, or temporarily getting exposed to toxins from a detox and Candida die-off? You tell me, but I feel that the latter is the lesser of the two. So, does anyone have any suggestions? Obviously, I wouldn’t be able to follow phase 1 very strictly as I would HAVE to have protein. My body is pretty good at processing proteins anyway, so my normal diet consisted of high protein and starches (like pasta, whole grain bread, and jasmine rice) with very limited sugars and fruits (just not a fan of sugary stuff). I always had regular bowel movements, so I’m assuming nothing would change with this, especially since I would be cutting out all starches. I’m ready to try anything because I’m extremely concerned with the long-term effects the Candida would have on my baby if I don’t do something soon."
1,raster,36,"Well this is typically a long term battle, not a short one, so I don’t really have much advice. You can’t get rid of candida very quickly (like in a month) from my experience. I say you should just wait until after birth. -raster"
2,whitetigress,36,"Yes, I agree. However, I’m trying to get as much of it treated as I can before the baby comes to help prevent any long-term problems in my child. If I can cut down on the amount of yeast from the vaginal infection and increase the amount of good flora, then maybe that combined with the antibodies that the baby will receive from breastmilk and then later from a good, healthy diet, the baby’s body will help fight off the candida in their body and so will not develop any long-term health problems. I’m afraid that if I wait after birth that the baby will not have gotten enough good flora from passing through the birth canal to fight the abundance of the candida and the toxins that it continually produces will harm my baby’s development and cause other major problems. However, the candida die-off may possibly cause harmful effects on my baby if I try to treat this as well. I guess it’s just a matter of how much toxins is my baby going to be exposed to? If I do this now then the baby will experience it for a short amount of time, but if I wait it may be a long-term battle and the baby may be exposed to toxins longer. I guess I just answered my own question, but I’m hoping that someone else may be able to provide more insight to all of this."
3,laurenziano,36,A Story I read about a multi millionaire who was impressed With the house from the movie “GONE WITH THE WIND” that he built an exact double for himself and his wife and child. After about five years his son got very sick and he developed Alzheimer. At work he would forget where he was and forget where he parked his car. They decided to check his house and found huge amounts of black mold and fungus in his basement. He moved out and his sons health came back and he came back to normal. Yeast overgrowth in the intestines cant be seen with a blood test or colonoscopy because yeast is microscopic and yeast eats and eats till you get chronic diahrrea or IBS-ULCERATIVE COLITIS OR CHRONS. I had candida yeast overgrowth and I cut out yeast bread and pizza and donuts and submarine sandwiches a year ago and am getting it under control. I stopped yeast next day my 15 trips to the bathroom stopped for over a year now. There are estimated 1.7 billion people in the world with yeast overgrowth who don’t. Even know what’s wrong with them. What do they all have in common they eat bread with yeast everyday. DO NOT EAT LEAVENED BREAD From the one who created bread.
0,dr divarum,37,"Hello. I just wanted to introduce myself to the forum. I tried the candida diet a couple months back after living in a damp, gross, black mold-infested apartment for ten months, started feeling great, then had a long and massive relapse thanks to holiday sweets and what have you. Well, I decided to start again on Feb 2 and have stuck much more strictly to the guidelines than I had last time. I also quit smoking weed and doing any other substances (sugar, caffeine, and anything harder than those. weed makes me eat EVERYTHING and then some).The first few days were very rough then my joints, muscles, back…everything started feeling better. My anxiety and brain fog have been improving in spite of mild die-off symptoms (Molybdenum chelated is a godsend) and insane carb cravings (I smelled buttered toast two days ago and it made my knees buckle). Yesterday and last night confirmed my leaky gut I think. I ordered a chicken salad grilled at McD’s with no cheese, chip strips, or dressing. All three were on there and I got paged for a delivery run right after receiving it so I just tossed the cheese and strips off and dealt with the little bit of dressing they so generously put on there for me. My belly was swollen for three hours after and my back didn’t feel to great either. I had to eat or I was going to pass out at the wheel. My body has been burning fuel like crazy lately it feels like. The awful sinus infection I got days into the diet (from not smoking?) probably isn’t helping. It’s way better now.Then last night when I got home there was a big fresh bowl of spicy sausage cheese dip left over from Superbowl. I caved…it was effing delicious. This morning however my diminishing B.O. and tongue film both have returned and my back is a little stiffer and I don’t feel as great. I still feel better than before, just took a step backwards. I did NOT eat the bonbons however! I also can gauge that my inflammation is a little higher than usual today by clasping my hands together and feeling how much pressure it puts on my fingers.Honestly the black mold poisoning I got from my old place was a blessing in disguise even though it was essentially hell not knowing what was wrong for so long. It brought all of my symptoms to a head and I HAD to figure out what was wrong or I would have probably ended up offing myself. I’ve had candida issues since living in a finished basement when I was 10 I’m starting to realize. I started having trouble getting up in the morning from then on and I was always a morning person before that.Anyhoo, I gotta eat my farm fresh eggs and avocado and turnip greens omelette now. I hope this forum and the information within can help me on my journey. I wish the best of luck to you beautiful people as well!"
1,laurenziano,37,You have yeast overgrowth. I wrote this already but I know you don’t know what is wrong with you and are looking for the solution. Worst part for me was not knowing what was wrong with me. I finally figured it all out. Diahrrea. 15 times a day -white tongue and sinus problems and brain fog all come from one problem “YEAST” in bread like buttered toast. Its not the bread its the yeast in the bread or donuts or submarine sandwiches what’s. Making you sick. Blood tests and doctors and colonoscopy cannot detect yeast overgrowth is yeast eating your intestinal walls which eats holes in your intestines walls and is leaky gut syndrome that causes chrons and ulcerative colitis which are ulcers caused by yeast. Find a lab that does yeast tests and you will find your answer for rest of your life. I cannot touch yeast buckles my knees and makes me vomit. I was full of yeast . I stopped yeast diahrrea stopped next day a year ago and never came back. A yeast test will be the best investment in your life. You will know for sure your problem and can learn to deal with it. I eat all kinds of rice barley corn bread. You have to stop yeast or you’re on the way of having your colon removed
0,TheChosenOne,38,"This post is a summary of what I’ve discovered so far. Since I’ll post this on another forum[/url] and because this post will be used to explain stuff to people that have no background whatshowever, it will contain things that are obvious to most people on this forum. The end on this post will contain questions, so you don’t really have to go through the whole post if you don’t want to. This post is rather long (sorry for that, I don’t like reading either), but it’s kind of important to go over it all since it is a coherent story. The most important info is at the end of this post. I’ve tried to be complete as possible.When I was a kid, I was rather healthy, strong and bright. I was somewhat more anxious than other kids. I hated big crowds and I was what other people might describe as ‘silent’. In the 3rd grade, I started to get quite serious dust mite allergies. I remember that the floor of our classroom was covered with mats. Especially during the winter time, when the heating was enabled, my allergies would flare up in a somewhat dramatical way. There were times that I wasn’t able to see the board because my eyes were covered in tears and I had to use 7-8 handkerchiefs which were all wet at the end of the day. I got some relief from homeopathic drops and saline, but it only softened the symptoms. I had swollen lymph nodes beneath my jaw and at the back of my head, which I thought was related to allergies. Later in primary school, I started to get nausious quite frequently, especially in busses and in cars but also just on hotter days. I also had a lot of cold hands and feet. This usually appeared together with cold sweats (as in feeling cold but sweating at the same time). Anyway, in the last years of primary school and the first years of high school, I started to get skinny to the point that people wondered whether I ate enough. I became chronically underweight and I actually started to feel ill at that time. For some reason I started to develop some form of ADD which appeared and disappeared from time to time, but not serious enough to be a big problem. I remember that I became very irritated when I was bored, which was basically most of the time. I thought a lot of courses went way too slow or were a lot of bullshit and braindead nonsense. During my whole childhood, I had a minor form of Athlete’s foot.Another symptom I had and concerned me a bit were heart problems. Those were threefold. The first type was pain that appears on the left side of my chest and it spreads until my left ring finger. This was the type that occured most frequently, but wasn’t all that problematic. I think the scientific term is ‘angina‘. The second type is a racing heart (tachycardia). This means a very fast heart beat (110-130) for a very long time (like a few hours) without doing any excercise. This is very tiring. When this happens, I usually have to lay or sit down. There is nothing that would make this symptom go away other than just resting. It usually takes a few hours, sometimes half a day, before my heart rate would return to normal. The last time this happened was half a year ago. I’ve taken a screenshot from my measurements back then. The first measurement was 130 bpm at 17h. One hour later it slowed down to 117 bpm and stay stable for 6 hours. In the middle of that night it was 105 bpm. My normal heart rate is 68 bpm.The third type is actually the most disturbing. It is an irregular heart rate. As far as I remember, I only had this twice. The way I can describe this is an asynchronous heart beat with occasional skips. Some people suggested[/url] to have this investigated, but meh.Thinking became a problem because of a symptom that most call ‘brain fog‘. The best way to describe this is ‘having a hangover without the pain’. This might explain a bit more about this symptom. There is actually a post[/url] that has examples of typical brain fog situations. During the middle to later years of high school, my weight got better (still not high enough), but other problems started to appear. These included intestinal cramps during he day, together with sometimes serious bloating. The bloating was really bad in the sense that walking or running would become painful and definitely not pleasant. Sometimes it was possible to hear the air in my bowels by just pushing on them. I also got weird pressure headaches and symptoms that could be related to as ‘diabetes’. High cravings for sugar, feeling bad before a meal or after physical excercises, trembling and dizziness. An example of trembling:Most of these symptoms got much better after a meal, but most of them didn’t disappear completely. Acne appeared and disappeard (after I stopped eating hydrogenated fats) and I was also tired during the day, although I always slept 8 hours a day. As a result I also looked very worn out. At some point someone made the remark that “I had a serious party last night.” even when this wasn’t true at all. I never went out during high school because I was tired most of the time. My liver would also hurt, like it wasn’t able to keep up with detoxification.I’ve never complained about anything and I probably never will, but this kind of attitude didn’t fix all these problems. I thought these things would go away automatically. Obviously this wasn’t the case. It took me until the end of high school, before I started to see some doctors. Mainly because of digestive issues. The first doctor thought I was making everything up and thought it was ‘all in my head’. The second one thought my bowels were ‘stressed out’ and prescribed me something that would relax them. I knew that this was nonsense and I threw away the prescription. He also told me that trembling was ‘in my nature’ and that ‘there was nothing that could be done about it’. He prescribed some vitamins for my fatigue. I didn’t pick them up either. The third doctor was a homeopath which thought I had ‘adrenal fatigue’ (which is actually a possibility) and gave me some something that didn’t really do anything. The fourth doctor was an osteopath. He thought that my liver was ‘overworked’ and gave me some brewage that he probably made himself. I think it contained things like artichokes and other herbs (like swedish bitters). He also found out that I supposedly had a bunch of allergies, especially cows milk, gluten and certain types of meat. Allergies would make a lot of sense. Mainly because my bowels were very irritated as in IBS. Fast food would give me terrible symptoms. A regular western diet was very bad for me, but on the other hand it is very bad for everyone. Avoiding gluten and milk improved my symptoms somewhat but not all that much. The fifth doctor was an internist (a doctor who is specialised in internal diseases). This was in 2012. She did a blood test for a lot of stuff and she discovered two things. First of all, my vitamin D3 levels were too low 19.6 ng/ml [40-100] and the IgG marker for candida was out of range 142 mgA/l [< 120]. There were undigested muscle fibers and fats in my stools. The skin test for allergies pointed out allergies for E210-E219 preservatives. Finally, the first real discovery."
1,TheChosenOne,38,"Candida is a fungus that naturally can be found in everyone’s digestive tract. In some individuals, this infestation goes out of control. Mainly because their immune system can’t keep the infestation under control or because their intestinal environment allows the fungus to become pathological (the lack of probiotics). Most people who suffer from a candida infestation have a history of antibiotic use. Candida leads to cramps, intestinal malabsorption, diarrea and other digestive issues. It makes the walls of the intestines permiable which results in small food particles that enter the bloodstream. This is why it is also called ‘leaky gut syndrome’. The small food particles that enter the bloodstream can trigger an allergic reaction which can disappear and appear again over time. This can make treating candida very difficult. Whenever the infestation goes ‘out of control’, the immune system intervenes and starts attacking the candida strains. Whenever candida dies, about 79 amount of different toxins get released which have to be cleaned up. Some of these chemicals cause dizziness (ethanol is one of them), others cause brain fog (acetaldehyde). All these symtpoms can have huge implications.Allopatic medicine doesn’t recognize candida in healthy individuals, only individuals that have a serious condition like aids or undergo chemotherapy. Candida occured in one of the episodes of House M.D. as a secondary disease. We live in a society where people assume that everyone is healthy. And if you are not you can just go to the doctor, they will fix your problem right? Allopatic medicine has no idea how to cure chronic conditions, like depression, ADD, chronic fatigue, ibs, high cholesterol, … because the solution to these diseases can not be found in just one wonder pill. All they do is symptom management. I started with diflucan which is an antifungal. This didn’t do anything. Then I got some other antifungals (caprylic acid) and digestive enzymes and I had to change my diet. When I did that, I noticably got better. A lot of symptoms that I related to as ‘diabetes’ improved in a serious way or even disappeared. Even my headaches got better. It happened a lot that when I took the train or the bike, I had to sit down for a while to recover, sometimes even up to half an hour. I felt like a 70 year old. This symptom disappeared too. The most noticable symptom that was still present was sugar addiction. I followed her advice for about a year. Most symptoms stayed the same during that peroid, but never completely disappeard. Everytime I ate something I should not eat, I noticed serious die-off. This was most noticable by flu like symptoms/very hot face. This is why I started to do some research on the internet. I found a forum called ‘The Candida Forum’. One of their users had a ‘protocol’ which was very popular amongst their members. It included a wide range of antifungals, probiotics and a very strict diet. It started with a ‘cleanse’ or a period of detox. I decided to commit completely to this protocol. The period of detox (of a few days) had a very strict period of only vegetables. I had to cut out all sources of sugar and protein. It also demanded to take some supplements for liver support (like molybdenum and milk thistle herb), as well as the use of bentonite clay to clean out your bowels. After this period, small amounts of eggs and later chicken may be added. In the meantime, I found out that I had a serious deficiency in stomach acid. Stomach acid is necessary to break down proteins. If the proteins are not broken down in a correct fasion, the food you eat and especially the sugars start to yeast in your system. This leads to massive bloating. I had to add 13 grams of hydrochloric acid to fix this. You have to realize that HCl comes in capsules of 1 gram. The bottle adviced to take only 1 capsule per meal. The bloating disappeared. The diet demonized fruits because it was a source of sugar. The beginning of this diet was very hard, because it lead to serious headaches and serious fatigue. It took me serveral months to recover from this to the extend that I failed all my exams in that period. This meant that I had to do them all over and I lost 1 year of college. Later in the diet I added some probiotics in pill form as well as kefir which I made myself. I used organic goats milk for this. Milk isn’t good for people with digestive issues, but I felt that it really helped to some extend. It would be much better to use raw milk, but we can’t have that, because the government has to protect us, right? The probiotics in pill form did absolutely nothing. The antifungals included caprylic acid, oregano oil, red thyme, coconut oil, SF277, … I never used pharmaceutical grade antifungals like nystatin or diflucan during this protocol because candida can adapt to these antifungals. Later on, I added bouilardii which is a fungal strain that competes with candida and is considered to be a probiotic. This helped me a lot. I followed the strict diet for quite some time but it didn’t take long before I realized that it would not solve the problem. I actually got really far in the diet without cheating a lot. The treatment for a chronic candida infestation is difficult because there are many factors that have to be considered and it may have many causes. As long as the cause of the infestation is not addressed, the infestation will reappear, no matter how many antifungals and probiotics you use. I was desperate. I had no more ideas. There were no doctors that could help me. I feared that this problem would never be solved and I had to change my diet permanently. Then I found a topic[/url] on the candida forum called This is a MUST read for everyone with CANDIDA.. It stated that most people with a candida infestation had mercury poisoning. The author of the post claimed to have cured himself this way. He refered to Amalgam Illness, diagnosis and treatment, a book of Andrew Cutler who has a PhD in chemistry. I immediately read his book. The similarities of the symptoms that are described with my own symptoms were pretty accurate.Gastrointestinal and endocrine problems, fatigue, inability to find the right words, brain fog, irritability, timidity or shyness, frequent headaches (especially with excessive stimulation), depression, anxiety, dizzyness or poor balance, tinnitus, diarrhea or constipation, cold hands and feet, Athlete’s foot, dry ankles, waking up late and staying up late, light sensitivity, myopia, loss of smell and hearing and understanding speech, night sweats, racing heart (tachycardia) or hart pain (angina), underperforming thyroid (resulting in overall low body temperature and endocrine function), excessive urination, weight loss, hypoglycemia, low blood pressure, hypogonadism, bed wetting (in children), unusually early or late puberty, allergies or asthma, blurred distance vision, metallic taste in mouth, leg cramps, chemical sensitivity, muscle tremors, speech that is hard to understand or without intonation, loss of coordination, fearful dreams/nightmares (children sleep with a blanket or their hands above their head), paleness, low testosterone/estrogens/androgens, gastrointestinal pain and gas, flattened emotions, yeast overgrowth, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue.I agree with 90% of these symptoms. Symptoms that I had and that are rather specific for mercury poisoning are light sensitivity, dry ankles, racing heart (tachycardia) or hart pain (angina), weight loss, unusually late puberty (I was 16), metallic taste (only as a child) and nightmares (Especially as a child. As a matter of fact, I did sleep with a blanket above my head.). By the way, the rethoric in this book is amazing.This is not the first time in the history of modern medicine that a very obvious disease was belittled and ignored for political reasons. Until recently it was believed that ulcers were entirely psychosomatic. Ulcer sufferers underwent prolonged treatment, were seldom cured, and often ended up under the surgeon’s knife. After years of intense criticism and ridicule – about 20 years after the research was published – it has fomally been accepted that most ulcers are due to helicobacter pylorii infection which can be easily cured with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Yet it is still common to find physicians who still treat ulcers by prescribing acid suppressors – as if they resulted from too much stomach acid.Cutler included a diagnostic checklist for mercury intoxication. From the 58 items, I was able to verify 27. 13 of them were positive, 14 negative which is indicative for mercury intoxication. Furthermore, I’ve always had a weird ‘burning’ sensation in my head which I could not place. I thought it was related to headaches. One day this symptom was easily distinctable from regular headaches. I googled ‘burning brain’ and this is the first website I found. This couldn’t be a coincidence anymore. I wasn’t satisfied with the checklist and all the matching symptoms. I had to be sure and ordered a hair test. I read his other book, Hair Test Interpretation: Finding Hidden Toxicities to understand how to read a hair test. These are the results of the hiar test:It’s not all that difficult to read a hair test, but you have to know what you have to look for. There are two things that can indicate mercury intoxication, high mercury levels or an unlikely mineral result. If a hair test is statistically unlikely, it may indicate ‘deranged mineral transport’ caused by mercury poisoning. I’ve given a mathematical explanation on my blog[/url]. Either way, having 6 bars or less to one side has a statistical probability of 2.6%. This means that 1 in 40 will have this kind of result at random. In conclusion, the results of the hair test are ‘highly suspicious’. Because there is suspicion of deranged mineral transport, the results of the toxic metals are not reliable. Shortly after that, I started chelation. Chelation involves the use of chemical compounds that have the ability to remove heavy metals. For mercury this is DMPS, DMSA or ALA. Alpha Lipoic Acid is a natural antioxidant that can cross the blood-brain barrier and is the most important chelator. DMSA can also chelate lead. Chelators have a certain half life. This means that the amount of this product halves after every x units of time. Chelators have to be taken frequently, otherwise the mercury gets redistributed without being moved out of your system. The half life of DMPS is 6 hours, for DMSA this is 4 hours and for ALA this is 3 hours. This means that DMPS have to be taken every 6 hours, ALA every 3 hours. Also at night. Before engaging in chelation, one must remove all amalgam fillings because they contain 50% mercury. Especially chelating with ALA while having amalgams can make a patient worse. According to Cutler, amalgams are the source of most mercury problems. There is a lot of debate about wether this is the case. There are a few studies that confirm that amalgam fillings significantly increase the level of mercury in saliva and feces, significantly impair kidney function in sheep and increase the amount of mercury in plasma and urine a 5 fold for users of nicotine gum. Other sources of mercury include fish. The mercury concentrations in fish increase about 4% per year caused by coal power plants, especially in big fish like tuna. Another source of mercury are vaccines. There is no real safe limit for mercury. The EPA has determined a ‘safe limit’ of 0.1 micrograms of mercury per kilogram of body weight per day, which is easily exceeded by either source. Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany have banned or limited the use of amalgams because it is unclear whether they are safe."
2,TheChosenOne,38,"Before I knew anything about mercury intoxication, my dentist automatically removed all amalgam fillings and replaced it with white composite fillings. I know that they contain BPAs, but it’s better than having a neurotoxin in my mouth right? Either way, I don’t have them anymore which is a good thing. I don’t know whether they are removed in a ‘safe’ way. I guess not, but whatever.So far, I’ve done 20 chelation rounds. I started off with DMPS only and then incorporated ALA. I substituted DMPS with DMSA once I ran out of it DMPS. I’ve included several breaks in between chelation rounds. There is a gap at the end of 2014 and another one in March 2015. The main reason for these gaps is the fact that chelation can be kind of heavy. It is true that chelating with DMPS is less intruding that chelating with DMSA. I’d really recommend DMPS over DMSA if you have the money available to use this. Between 1 December and 9 December I broke my arm and they immediately gave me a tetanus vaccine. I was under the assumption that most of the vaccines didn’t contain mercury anymore. Apparently, I was wrong. The night after I got the vaccine was horrible. I was nauseated, dizzy, had a headache, felt very ‘weird’ and couldn’t sleep. I also had a fever, although I had almost no pain. After I was released from the hospital, I immediately restarted chelation with DMPS. The fever continued for 2 more chelation rounds. I didn’t have a fever in between those rounds. During chelation, I take zinc (50 mg), vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) (1-2 g), a B50 complex, vitamin E (100 IU) and selenium (200 mcg). A lot of symptoms improved during chelation. I feel best at the first day of each chelation round. This may be because of the antioxidant properties of ALA. On the last day, I always feel like my brain is being squeezed like a sponge. I’m pretty sure this has nothing to do with the interrupts in my sleep. The biggest general improvements have been in the area of digestion. The general advice is to clean up the gut before starting chelation. I’ve tried a lot of things to accomplish this. Nothing seemed to work long term. The other way around is the way to go for me, chelate in order to cure my gut. I can basically eat anything now without having issues the day after. Sugar doesn’t seem to affect me anymore. The only thing that I avoid are animal proteins. I eat a mostly vegetarian diet with some exceptions of fish and chicken once and a while (maybe 1-2 servings per week), although I don’t feel that I need it. The main component of my diet are fruits. Athlete’s foot is almost completely gone, brain fog is gone, trembling is mostly gone, sugar addiction is gone, headaches are gone, heart problems haven’t occured anymore. I’ve gained a significant amount of weight. Before I started chelation, I weighed 64 kg. For a height of 192 cm, this results in a BMI of 17.4 which is underweight. Now I weigh 70 kg (BMI = 19). My ideal weight is around 80 kg. I guess this is because my gut has healed significantly. The only symptoms related to candida that I still have are a warm head after die off and oral thrush when I eat too much prepared foods. Other symptoms that are related to energy and mood have improved, but way slower than I expected (while the gut issues have improved much faster than anticipated).When I found this forum last year, I found out about the connection between mercury poisoning and methylation problems, so I ordered a test from 23andme. I’m not gonna explain methylation here. This is a very simplified explanation. This a more extensive explanation. The most important thing you have to know is that it is involved in the production of neurotransmitters and catecholamines (like serotonin and dopamine) and also detoxification and the reduction of oxidative stress. It is also connected to the krebs cycle (energy). The main components that are used by the methylation cycle are methylfolate and methylcobalamin. If your methylation cycle doesn’t work correctly, it may lead to a wide range of diseases like alzheimers, depression, autism, bipolar disorder, heart disease or stroke, chronic fatigue, … Having methylation mutations is not uncommon. About 50% of the population has at least 1 mutation in the most important gene, C677T. It’s mainly the combination of mutations can cause problems. Certain mutations are protective. These are my results (+ is a mutation, while – is the normal allele):MTHFR C677T (or MTHFR in general) converts converts folate into methylfolate. This product breaks down homocysteine and produces methionine. The MTRR genes are responsible for the recycling of methylB12. MTRR is negatively impacted by mercury. (Having mercury intoxication is like having extra mutations.) The lack of B12 will make the krebs cycle run in the reverse direction, which can be aggravated by aluminium. Lithium enhances the transport of B12 and folate into the cells. A MTRR A66G mutation increases activity of the enzyme. It’s going through B12 faster which results in lower levels of lithium and methylB12. This is also true for the CBS gene. A mutation in this gene makes the enzyme work faster. CBS converts homocysteine into cystathionine. The pathways that are linked to CBS are the transsulfuration and glutatione synthesis. It eventually raises ammonia levels and hydrogen sulfate which both lead to brain fog. CBS depletes glutathione as well as homocysteine and soaks up methyl donors. Ammonia depletes BH4 levels. SUOX is needed to convert sulfites. Sulfites decrease ATP, glutathione and blood sugar. SUOX is inhibited by heavy metals and requires B12 and molybdenum to work. Molybdenum is also used by people who have a candida infection. The aldehydes that are produced by candida must be detoxed with molybdenum and can therefore impair SUOX function. The BHMT genes are responsible for the ‘shortcut’ route and converts homocysteine directly into methionine without the need for methylB12/folate. This route is of less importance because it is not active in the brain. People with BHMT mutations have more homocysteine available which leads to a higher CBS ‘drain’. An important gene on this panel is COMT. The COMT enzyme is responsible for the breakdown of dopamine and (nor)epinephrine (= adrenaline) by adding a methyl group to these compounds. People who have COMT +/+ or +/- have a high supply of dopamine. The problem is that dopamine feeds back and inhibits itself. People with COMT+/+ end up with mood swings. On top of that, people with AHCY mutations might have an extra inhibition of COMT. While COMT only has a small influence on the methylation cycle (people with COMT +/+ have more methyl donors available), it is a serious limiting factor on how much methyl donors a person can tolerate. Furthermore there is an interesting correlation between COMT and melanin levels. Melanin is what gives hair and skin color and is produced as a response to UV radiation. If dopamine levels are too high, not only the dopamine receptors are inhibited, but also the enzyme that produces dopamine is. As a result, when dopamine levels are too low, a backup enzyme (tyrosinase) is being used to produce dopamine. This enzyme is also responsible for melanin production. What is commonly seen is the fact that people with COMT mutations have a lighter skin or hair color. COMT is also responsible for the processing of estrogens. Vitamin D is important with regard to COMT activity. Vitamin D reduces thyroriduxine reductase. Because COMT and thyroriduxine reductase share the same promotor, an increase in vitamin D will increase COMT activity. People with COMT mutations are prone to mood swings. There is a correlation between COMT downregulation and bipolar disorder.Most of this information comes from the talks of Dr Amy Yasko. You can find them on vimeo on her channel. The talk that is most important in my case is the one on COMT."
3,TheChosenOne,38,"Current methylation supplements: Hydroxycobalamin 1000 mcg (sublingual): MTRR Methylfolate 200 mcg: MTHFR Methylcobalamin ~50 mcg: MTRR Phosphatidylcholine 300 mg: BHMT and CBS Trimethylglycine 500 mg: BHMT and CBS Vitamin D3 5000 IU: VRD Taq. Dosage depends on the season. Obviously more during winter than during summer.I currently can’t tolerate methylcobalamin in high doses. It makes me ‘mixed’ or hyper without really giving energy.Current support for candida: Molybdenum 150 mcg: Supports SUOX and combats candida die off. Saccharomyces Boulardii: This is a competing yeast strain and ‘eats’ candida. It is considered to be a probiotic. Chromium 200 mcg: Improves blood sugar metabolism.Current support for COMT: GABA 500 mg: Controls the release of dopamine. Magnesium Citrate 500 mg: Improves to function of GABA. I also use this to combat leg cramps (especially during night). It is also possible that a lower protein diet could have solved this. Lithium orotate 10 mg: This dose is much lower than used in bipolar disorder, but it seems to have a significant effect. L-Tyrosine 500 mg: Precursor of dopamine. Started it only recently. It seems to give me more motivation and it makes me more awake. It seems very effective to counter low periods. I’m curious whether the effect stays long term. If I take 2 doses, I get a headache.Other supplements Manganese 15 mg: Supposed to reduce bowel inflammation and it improves SOD2. Vitamin C 1-2 g: General antioxidant Melatonin with B6 3 mg: Sleep Glycine 2 g: Amino acid. I feel no difference on this product, so I’m gonna stop using it once the box is empty.Rx drugs: Ebastine 20 mg: H1 antihistamine for my dust mite allergy Fluticasone furoate 27.5 mcg: Corticosteroid for my dust mite allergy The combination of the two work very well.Supplements/drugs that I used to take (and did work): Oregano oil: antifungal Red Thyme: antifungal Chia seeds: improve bowels Bentonite clay: bowel detox Dandelion root: liver detox/support Coconut oil: antifungal (still take it once and a while) Milk Thistle: liver detox/support Betaine HCl: stomach acid Ashwaghanda: adrenal support Iodine: Thyroid supportSupplements/drugs that didn’t do anything: Diflucan: antifungal Swedish bitters: enzymes MegaFlora: (very expensive) probiotic SF722: antifungal Grapefruit Seed Extract: antifungal 5-HTP: serotonin precursor Adrenal Cortex: adrenal support Phosphaditylserine: BHMT (Apparently this lowers cortisol levels, so this is what I dont’t want.) PS: I never used it in my current methylation program, so I don’t know the effectiveness.I tried some NAC a few weeks ago, but it caused nightmares. The effect on my overall wellbeing have been mixed. I’m gonna leave it out for now.My most important message is that probiotics didn’t do anything (and are expensive).Two things have improved since the start of methylation support, energy and mood. I don’t know if I can improve energy levels even more. Mood has improved in a weird way. I’ve had mood swings in the past, but I always had a ‘low’ mood. My mood didn’t go up in a consistent way. I still have ‘low’ episodes (not that bad anymore), but I have more periods of normal and even ‘high’ episodes. I guess this is because methyl donors destabilize dopamine levels. Apparently trembling and lack of coordination and balance can be caused by low dopamine.The original plan was to do 100 chelation rounds, but that may be too much. I’ve stopped chelation temporarily, in order to figure out the correct methylation support in the hope to speed up the process of chelation. The plan is to do a functional methylation test to optimize methylation before continuing chelation. Either way, Cutler doesn’t believe methylation makes a difference. But I believe that fixing methylation can speed up the healing process. I expect that I don’t need any support for methylation once all mercury has been cleaned up, maybe only a ‘clean’ diet. We’ll see.Someone pointed out pyroluria on my thread about bipolar. Pyroluria is an abnormality in hemoglobin synthesis. Pyroluria can be cause by genetics but also by heavy metals. It depletes zinc and B6 (CBS uses up B6 and BHMT uses zinc) and it results in a form of anemia and low iron levels. Maybe that is a possible explanation for my rather low ferritin levels? The most outspoken symptom of anemia is a pale skin and a dark color under the eyes. A lot of the symptoms between pyroluria and mercury intoxication are very similar, although the pyroluria symptoms seem more specific. There is an interesting post on curezone which explains a correlation between low ferritin, low thyroid and adrenals and a chronic candida infection. I know that I had to take iron supplements in the past. One of the symptoms of anemia are palpitations.The plan for now: Do a functional methylation test. Do a pyroluria test. Then follow one of the methylation plans on this forum. Restart chelation.Additional results that can be useful (not mentioned in this post): Ferritin: 33 mcg/l [22-275] Serum B12: 227 ng/l [> 187] Serum folic acid: 7.0 µg/l [> 3.1] IgA: 215.1 mg/dl [70-400] IgG: 1174 mg/dl [700-1600] IgM: 73.1 mg/dl [40-230] IgE: 29.2 kU/l [< 114] Complement C4: 11.9 mg/dl [15-45] (Dunno what this means. Has to do with immune function?) Rast d202 nDer p1: 1.8 kU/l [< 0.1] (marker for dust mite allergies) Rast d2 dermatophagoides farinae: 2.24 kU/l [< 0.10] (again dust mite allergies) Rast d203 rder p2: 2.45 kU/l [< 0.10] (same) Wheat f4 IgG: 3.38 mgA/l [< 7.76] Tomato f25 IgG: 6.50 mgA/l [< 7.06] Celery f85 IgG: 4.96 mgA/l [< 7.06] Avocado f96 IgG: 4.72 mgA/l [< 7.06] H. pylori IgG: negative TSH: 1.87 mU/l [0.35-4.94] Leukocytes: 3080/mcl [3700-10000] (Apparently less than 4000 is considered ‘low’. A vitamin B12 deficiency could be the cause here.) Lymfocytes: 44.4% [16-45] (High count is usually a sign of a viral infection?) Monocytes: 9.4% [< 12] (Levels above 8 are high. Chronic inflammation is one of the causes.) Neutrophil granulocyte: 1460/µl [1340-5860] (Levels beneath 1700 are considered as ‘neutropenia’. Vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is one of the possible causes.)Questions: What is the connection between the methylation cycle and histamines? According to MTHFRsupport, I have a slow liver phase II detox with regards to phase I. An increase in B vitamins speed up phase I, which increases the intermediates and thus oxidative stress. How important is it to fix this? Do I need to fix this before methylation? Has anyone tried to avoid phenols (with regard to COMT)? What kind of functional methylation test should I order? I’m located in Europe. What other tests might be helpful? Maybe serum amino acid levels? T3/T4? Are there other things that genetic genie doesn’t report that might be intresting, like GCH1 and SHMT? Or are they not all that relevant?It is possible that I forgot to include some things in this post. But it is already way too long, so I’m gonna leave it as it is."
4,TheChosenOne,38,"It’s been a while since I’ve given an update. I’ve come to new insights. Foremost, I’ve been completely wrong about half my first post. I’ll explain in a moment what I was wrong about and why. A few months ago, @caladonia made a reply to my thread and he mentioned pyrrole disorder as a cause of bipolar. Pyrrole disorder (also called pyroluria) is a metabolic disorder in which the liver produces too much pyrroles. This is a compound used for the production of hemoglobin. Pyrroles tend to bind themselves with certain minerals and vitamins, mainly vitamin B6 and zinc, but also magnesium and manganese. Zinc is used in a wide range of enzymes as well as the production of neurotransmitters and testosterone. B6 is necessary for the transulfuration pathway to work and is also used to convert Glutamate into GABA. GABA is what slows down neurotransmitters and it has a calming effect. Glutamate is excitatory and causes awareness. Most people with anxiety problems have too much Glutamate or not enough GABA or both. For a full list of symptoms see here.Not long after I stopped the chelation protocol, I redevelopped some form of digestive distress. It took a while to figure out what was going on. Turns out I only took zinc during chelation itself and not in between rounds, so also not during the long break I was/am in. The first thing I did was retaking the B complex just to experiment what would happen (no active B forms in this one). The difference was there but it wasn’t massive. I felt somewhat better for sure. I ordered p5p (which is an active form of B6). The difference was about the same. Mood swings decreased, anxiety went down. No more nightmares or vivid dreams. So I slowly upped my zinc dosage from just 50 mg to 150 mg right now.Right after chelation, most of my digestive issues were gone, but not all of them. Right now they are gone 100% 🙂 I can eat everything I want inluding fast food like pizza and hamburgers. The only thing that I still avoid is pure sugar. Other types of sugar are fine (mostly). So I can eat bread and potatos without much problems. Despite the fact that my digestion is ‘fixed’, I still have die-off from candida which I don’t completely understand. I know that a fungus infection can be located in other locations than the digestive tract. It can infect other organs as well (liver, prostate, galbladder…). The die off I still have is limited to just an hour or so per day, rarely a whole afternoon. I feel like this is highly dependent on the amount of rest (sleep) I have and stress levels. The die off used to be something permanent which was horrible. Remember that I mentioned allergies? They are all gone (except dust mites). Including problems with milk. According to Promeathase, I should have the ability to digest milk. I found it kind of odd that this was a problem. I have all the ‘good’ gene variants for digesting lactose:There is an other remarkable thing that has changed. The amount of hair on my chest has more than trippled. I guess testosterone levels are finally starting to rise. I see this as an indication that I’m moving in the right direction. Testosterone is highly zinc dependent. It’s also true that testosterone blocks the transsulfuration pathway, hence lowering glutathione production. It’s possible your body will lower testosterone in order compensate for low glutathione?There is not a whole lot of research done about pyrrole disorder. The best information that I can find is the presentation from dr Klinghardt. I know it’s a 2 hour video but it’s explained in a very easy way.There also seems to be a connection between candida and pyrrole disorder. I’ve found an ‘aternative’ website that makes the connection between a candida infection and pyrrole disorder, both promoting each others presense. It’s actually the only source I found that is so complete. This article is also worth reading. A summary. Foremost, the zinc deficiencies that are caused by this disorder can cause massive digestive distress (because of the impaired enzyme production). When other factors like stress, heavy metals, a bad diet (and possibly antibiotics) are present, the yeast form of candida (which is present in everyone) will transform into its fungal form. This makes a candida infection not a disease, but part of a larger chronic problem. Large pieces of candida will cover the intestinal wall making holes in it causing ‘leaky gut’ and inflammation. This intestinal permeability allow small food particles to enter the blood stream causing a wide range of symptoms, mainly food allergies. Candida toxins absorbed from the intestines into the blood disable much of the energy production in the brain, muscles, connective tissue and in the mitochondria, but also in the liver, which makes the impaired heme production much worse. Waste protein block up capillaries and brain cells. This results in a severe energy deficiency in parts of the brain.Most important symptoms: abdominal pain, neuropathy, psychiatric disorders (anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism, dementia and obsessive compulsive disorder), tachycardia (fast heartbeat), severe photosensitivity, anemia, liver problems, psoriaris, weak connective tissue and overreaction to alcohol and other drugs. Pyrrole disorder is mainly caused by candida overgrowth, certain microbes, viruses and borrelia (lyme). Pyrrole disorder that is acquired can be inherited, but the opposite is also true. If pyrrole disorder is cured, then it is no longer inheritable? Without heme, cells cannot generate energy from oxidizing food. Depression of heme production leads to serious metabolic defects with anaemia, mitochondrial and neuronal decay, mental-emotional problems and overproduction of nitric oxide. Underproduction of oxidative energy in muscles causes weakness, especially during extended exertion after glycogen has been used up and mainly lactic acid is generated. The combination of these factors can lead to fatigue, muscle pain and muscle cramps. The heart is an essential muscle and may compensate for the lower output by becoming enlarged. Another factor is a decreased generation of body heat. When the outside temperature drops so that hands and feet become cold, central body heat is preserved by greatly restricting blood-flow to the extremities. From this it is easy to see how the disturbed production of heme has wide-ranging negative effects on all body functions, even before taking the serious vitamin B6 and zinc deficiencies into account that are created in this way. Deficiencies of vitamin B6, zinc and biotin also directly reduce the synthesis of heme, their deficiencies increase stress levels, causing weak adrenal glands, and stress independently degrades heme. It is a vicious circle. Further, it is known that heavy metals, especially mercury, tend to disrupt the porphyrin metabolism and increase heme degradation. Heme depression increases leakage of oxidants from the mitochondria, thereby causing oxidative damage to cells and unsaturated oils. P5P deficiencies are associated with lower glutathione. Reduced heme production means reduced catalase production. Catalase degrades hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is what is used to ‘color’ hair blond. It simply causes depigmentation by destruction of melanin. Furthermore, melanin is rich in zinc. People with pyrrole disorder have a tendency to be pale. While having a low blood pressure when young, this blood pressure will rise over time because of arterial congestion. Some proteins can clean up pyrrole waste. These are serrapeptase for cleaning skin, muscles, joints and other tissue from pyrrole residues and other accumulated wastes, nattokinase for cleaning the blood vessels, and at times additional bromelain and possibly papain for general clean-up of protein residues. There are several ways in which pyroluria and Candida, individually and jointly, affect the brain. There is the deficiency of neurotransmitters caused by P5P and zinc deficiency, the blockage of the mitochondrial oxidative energy generation by chemicals produced by candida and other microbes, and there is the clogging up of capillaries and brain cells with inflammatory and acidic pyrrole-based waste protein. The combined effect of these assaults is severe energy deficiency in parts of the brain in addition to a lack of proper nerve transmission. Problems are intensified by commonly existing multiple allergies and mercury toxicity. Even relatively young individuals with severe inherited pyroluria may accumulate high levels of waste proteins in brain cells as is typical for individuals with dementia, Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease. Blackouts or ‘grey-outs’ tend to be a common stress response of sensitive individuals with uncontrolled pyroluria. Stress, just like coffee or sweet food, strongly increases the blood sugar level in preparation for physical action. But if no such action happens, the pancreas releases an excessive amount of insulin in response to the elevated blood sugar level. This drives the blood sugar down too low which, in association with the resulting low blood pressure, causes severe lack of energy in the brain. Affected individuals may end up in the medical system with lots of X-rays, scans and other tests without finding a cause. All problems are much worse if there is in addition mercury toxicity, but attempt mercury removal only after pyroluria and Candida are under control.I don’t know how much of this information is correct. But it seems to describe a huge part of my symptoms pretty accurate. Symptoms: Pale skin. Especially as an infant. White spots on the fingernails (leukodynia) are a very strong indication of this problem. This is a picture that was taken a few weeks ago. Even after some moderate zinc supplementation. I used to have them in abundance (and much larger) as a child. About half of people with pyrrole show these white spots.Trouble sleeping and going late to bed. Rarely any dream recall. Very bad tolerance to stress. Severe anxiety as a child. Late puberty. Great sensitivity to light. Snow during a sunny day or white clouds hurt enormously. Also some sound sensitivity. (Both could also be related to something else, see later.) Cold hands and feet. (Limited body heat generation might be the reason why I’m doing worse during winter time and not necessarily because of low vitamin D. This also explains normal thyroid TSH levels, so probably no thyroid problem.) Neurological pain, like everywhere. Muscle cramps. Blackouts. A lot of these symptoms are partially stress dependent.Pyrrole is often present in Multiple Sclerosis.For a more more psychological point of view: click. Of course the biochemical explanation is the only relevant one.Pyrrole disorder doesn’t explain everything. There are things that are probably caused by something else. I’m still missing a piece of the puzzle.To be honest, doing chelation without medical supervision is kind of madness. Especially mentally this is extremely demanding. I had periods where my thinking process was completely blocked. On the last night of most chelation rounds, I was usually so exhausted that I just slept through my alarm, missing the dose I had to take. I wish I knew about this a long time ago, then I could have fixed this first. Mistakes were made… Pyrrole disorder might explain the low white blood count. 3000 is really low. According to Klinghardt: “The white blood cells are the last things that looses to zinc. If that goes down, it’s really really bad.” Something else Klinghardt said: “There ain’t such a thing as indigo children. This is all way of rationlalizing that we screwed these children up and we are trying to make it something sacred so we don’t have to do anything about it. These are children that we hurt really really badly. And the indigo children look is a KPU look. And that goes away when you treat it. They become normally tanning children that don’t look so transparent like you can look through them.” This is kind off odd, but it could just be coincidence. One thing my mother told me recently: “The only thing you did as a baby was eating and sleeping. I always wondered why you slept so much.” Both sources are talking about lyme as a major cause of pyrrole disorder. I hope this is not the case because it is a hard to cure.So far, I’ve had very good results with p5p and a B complex, together with zinc. I also tried nattokinase and serraptase. My first impression is that they are very calming. They also seem to have cured some skin problems (coarse skin), but that’s the easiest thing to get rid of. I guess other things will take much longer. I recover faster from candida die off. Once the die off stops, I don’t feel terrible anymore after about half an hour. Either way, whatever I do, I’m lost if I don’t sleep enough.Things I was wrong about: Pyrrole disorder is a way more complete description. It’s actually overwhelmingly accurate in my case. What I considered (hypo)mania might might just be normal after all and be periods of mental clarity and lack of brain fog and neurological problems. If you’re sick for so long, it’s a bit hard to know how being healthy feels like. I think there is also an other factor at work, inflammation. The reason why lithium helped is because it is protective for a wide range of stuff[/url]. I now only take it once a week, until the bottle is empty.I dedicated a whole part of my first post try to explain how genetic mutations can lead to methylation problems. I’m now convinced that this is highly inaccurate. Genetics is almost never the cause of any disease, unless you are very unlucky. There are only genetic tendencies, but as long as there are no bad environmental factors, they are not really relevant. Everyone has genetic weaknesses somewhere. The question is rather whether they are being expressed or not. Furthermore, most of the so called ‘mutations’ are just polymorphisms, so they are not necessarily malignent. Take for example the C677T gene. About 10% of the Western population has a double mutation and most of them are doing perfectly fine, more than 50% has at least 1 mutation. Overall, they have a lower output of SAMe, but they have more glutathione available. Which one is better? You tell me. Only very unfortunate combinations or mutations that have an occurance in less than 1% of the population might be the only thing that is worth concidering. Genetics can be helpful if you want to cure yourself, but they are unlikely to be the cause of disease. To go over them quickly: COMT V158M++ (~20%): Advantage in memory and attention tasks. Higher dopamine levels. COMT–: More stress resistent. Promethease sees ++ as beneficial. MTRR A66G+- (~30%): Normal. MTRR K350A+- (~20%): Lack of research. MTRR A664A+- (~40%): Possibly need more B12. ++ is kind of rare. BHMT-02++ (~10%): Shortcut through the methylation cycle. Is not important once the long route is fixed. May be related to AD(H)D. BHTM-08++ (~15%): cfr. AHCY-01+- (~20): Not much research about it. Possibly higher cysteine levels. AHCY-19+- (?): cfr. CBS C699T+- (~50%): Slight CBS upregulation. Lower homocysteine levels and higher glutathione. Beneficial. CBS A360A+- (?): Lack of research.So, there isn’t a single polymorphism that can cause any problems. I guess the treatment of Yasko relies on a lot of try and error and she probably uses genetics to back up her treatment with some sort of theoretical base which may or may not make sense.Something else I found out. Remember in the first post, I was talking about a feeling that could be described as ‘burning brain’. I’m starting to become convinced that this may be inflammation. The reason why I believe I’m dealing with inflammation is because I tried two anti-inflammatories recomended by Hip[/url] with varying results. This problem is actually the most limiting issue. Other stuff that help with this problem is Magtein (Magnesium that crosses the BBB). I have great success with N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG), but I have to take much higher doses than what he takes. It also loses potential after a while. I’ve also tried flax seed oil, but not consistent enough to be able to conclude anything. I had a terrible experience with turmeric, which I had high hopes for. I really think it has great potential, but I can’t use it for now for some reason. The effect of turmeric were similar of that of N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC). NAC almost nocked me out. You can read about it here[/url]. Either way, whatever I do is mostly irrelevant if I haven’t slept enough. Now that I’m working and can’t sleep than I’m used to, this problem has become really apparent.I have no idea what causes this burning sensation/inflammation. It is possible that glutathione levels are low? Maybe it’s a cortisol problem (it subsides during the evening) or glutamate overload. I don’t think pyrrole disorder can cause these levels of inflammation. This problem is somewhat correlated with trembling/other neurological problems. If they get worse, inflammation gets worse. One thing that is really odd is the fact that this pain can move around. Usually it’s on the left side of my head, sometimes right behind my eyes, other times it’s everywhere or more to the side of my neck. There are certain things that aggravate this. Bright light, loud noises, large groups of people, reading articles/books, stress. In practice, this means things like supermarkets, stores, studying, cinema, … I also think inflammation is the cause of the numerous headaches I had as a child.There are things that I cannot explain at this moment: Random neurological pain. It can occur in my back, knees, thumbs. Joint pain that moves around. Used to be in my right knee for some time, right shoulder, but mostly in my fingers. Itching left shoulder. Pins and needles on my back, chest and head (only after exercise). Heart pressure/pain. Balance problems which occur at random. These symptoms occur mostly together.Other rare things that happen: ‘Double vision’ in my right eye. It is very difficult to read anything with it, even with glasses and big font. It looks like words are moving and I don’t have complete vision. I have a -2 correction, which isn’t that big. I’ve recently noticed that I have a layer of static noise on top of my vision. It’s called Visual Snow, but it’s very minor and I don’t notice unless I focus on it. I also have some eye floaters.Something that is very weird: sort of ‘pulsating’ that can occur everywhere, usually in my arms. I hope I can record this sometime.Doing a urine test for pyrrole disorder is probably not all that useful for multiple reasons. Foremost, I’ve been taken large amounts of B6 and zinc. And now that I’m no longer studying but working, stress levels are greatly reduced. I’ve ordered a urine test anyway, but I expect it to be negative. For now, I’ve ceased all supplements. By the time I do the urine test, it would be 2.5 weeks without them. Meanwhile at the office without supplements and a lack of sleep. What you see here is what I have all the time, internal tremors. But now they are clearly visible.Edit: I’ve done the urine test (from Keac in The Netherlands). Not under uptimal conditions. There was a bit of light coming the the room. I don’t have fluorescent lights. But I did use aluminium foil. I’ve sent the package through the post. Unfortunately, the people at the post office didn’t understand “as fast as possible”, so it was 6 days on it’s way. Uncooled! There are two reasons for the test to be negative. The amount of supplements I took before doing the test. The lab states that: “Your result can be false negative if you recently took vitamins and minerals on a regular basis. The amount of excreted HPL decreases gradually and will in the short period that you are not using supplements, right before the test, go up a little, but maybe inadequate to get a positive result. In general you can assume that the test will be negative if you’ve taken more than 100 mg B6 for a long period of time.”. Second reason is the time between collection and testing. According to Applied Analytical Laboratories:HPL is very reactive and decomposes as soon as it leaves the body. It has a half-life of 10-12 hours (which means that if not frozen, after the first 24 hours, the level of HPL in the sample will be approximately 20% of the original value and 5% of the original value after 48 hours – which is also dependent on ambient temperature and other factors). In terms of results, this property results in enormous variability (which is not desirable for a reliable diagnostic test). In early development work on urinary pyrrole test in Australia by this author, it was also found that the exposure of samples to direct sunlight (or collection in a room illuminated by direct sunlight) resulted in almost instantaneous elimination of all HPL activity. In almost all cases in this laboratory, no detectable HPL has been found in samples that have thawed during transit (or arrived unfrozen).I was highly surprised that the test came back as ‘lightly positive’ which makes me wonder what the real result is. The actual number is 0.625 (they use umol/l). According to the half-life counting, it would be 2^12 = 4096 time higer which is kind of impossible. So the half life rule is probably something that only works initially. This result is in line with the hair test and confirms what I already knew. Now I know a bit more. Pyrrole disorder is an indicator that there is something wrong and it is an important marker for oxidative stress and inflammation. The question I have is what the real value of this test actually was. And more importantly, whether lyme is involved in all this. If that’s the case, it would change the whole story.The lab advices maximum 30 mg of zinc and 50 mg of p5p per day, which are very low doses.I’ve been taken 3×250 mg B6, 100-150 mg zinc picolinate and 50 mg p5p per day. Especially the high B6 levels are really beneficial. It will take some time to understand what the implications are long term, but so far they are good. All white zinc spots on my fingers are gone. I have less cold hands and feet. Candida die off is waaaaay down. Neurological pain and muscle pain also lower. I may need to go as high as 2000 mg B6 / day. That’s 1000x the daily recommended dose 🙂 100 mg zinc is probably still too low. But taking high amounts of zinc can knock off copper levels.Spoken about lyme, there are a lot of blogs of people who are dealing with lyme. They contain a tremendous amount of helpful information. Especially when it comes to fighting inflammation. Coincidentially, I found a blog[/url] of someone who has done a hair test that has a striking resemblance with my own hair test. The symptoms she had/has (halfway through the page) are mostly similar as well. She got better through chelation only.I always had the idea that people with lyme are bedridden, but this isn’t the case in most situations.Some other video that I stumbled upon from someone who is dealing with lyme:Listen to what he says from 10m40s to 13m00s.There are other symptoms that are interesting, especially this one:Short term memory loss in those with Lyme Disease usually plays out in a manner similar to this: Thinking of something to say, waiting for the person being spoken to to finish their statement, knowing that you’ll be able to recall it in a few seconds, and then when those few seconds are up, being completely unable to find or recall that idea or what you wanted to say. This can be very embarrassing. This cognitive dysfunction can include just finding the right word for expression, or if they’re really brazen, telling entire idea or story.In the meantime, I’ve made an appointment with a (ILADS) lyme and ME/CFS specialist, to figure out if there is a possibility of having lyme and also to figure out other stuff. Things are becoming kind of complicated. Someone on this forum made a post[/url] about him. I still have to read it.Lyme tests tend to be very inaccurate and have a high rate of false negatives. I heard the IGeneX lab has the most accurate test?I hope next post, I’ll be able to post some lab results."
5,alexisMCA,38,Wow you have been through hell and back like many of us have but what I am reading is so impressive because you are researching and charting your course and understanding.I am struggling on day 17 of the anti-candida diet and started from an acute phase where everything was blown up by it and learning so much.It is maddening a lot of this because there are so many subtleties that one has to learn in error and the error is die-off symptoms and hell!You mention turmeric as you wrote about could be a trigger for something. I use it everyday in my green morning drink. I believed it was helpful for me and overall but perhaps you can share what you notice specific from turmeric to help me identify if it may be a trigger for something I am experiencing that I believe is die-off that is not.Thank you for sharing!Alexis
6,TheChosenOne,38,What I experience from turmeric isn’t die off. It’s something else. It feels like it is irritating my nerves. I don’t know how else to explain it. Maybe it is inflammatory related.
7,alexisMCA,38,Thank you for sharing!
8,TheChosenOne,38,"Note: I’ve found the root cause of the problem, which means that this is probably my last post on this forum. You can always find me on PhoenixRising under the same username. Some of the formatting is also messed up. For better formatting: see my phoenixrising post.It’s been a while since I got all the results. Figuring everything out and writing it all down took some time, hence the delay. I also wasn’t really overjoyed in starting to write either.During the first appointment at Himmunitas, you have to fill in a list with symptoms. Dr Richard Horowitz has a similar questionnaire that specifically assesses Lyme. I got a score of 45 when I filled in his list which implies a high probability of a tick-borne infection. Himmunitas is led by Dr. Kenny De Meirleir (KDM) who is a professor at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. People from whole Europe come to Belgium to visit him.KDM quickly goes over the list. “I know what’s going on.” he said. “Please lay down.” He pushed on my lower abdomen which hurt a lot. “The connection between your small and large intestine is inflamed. The good news is that this is easy to fix.” KDM doesn’t really says much but he asks very specific questions. How long has this been going on? What is your profession? Where do you live? Do you have any fillings? Do you have any pets? Do you take any medications? A few minutes later he already wrapped up. “I’m sure this is Lyme. But we’ll wait for the test results. Soon, you’ll receive a list of tests that we will run.” It felt like I was only 10 minutes in his office.KDM has a reputation to call everything Lyme. I wanted proof, black on white.One day later, I received an email with all the tests and price (in Euro). Mold antibodies 41.72 Immunophenotyping 20 Pro-inflammatory Cytokines 164 CD57 absolute count 62 SCD14 70 PGE2 Elisa 70 VEGF Elisa 70 IMBA 75 Ammonia 70 Kynurenic acid 100 BABESIA FISH 140 DNA extraction 50 Bartonella PCR 99 SeraCHLAM 159 Borrelia elispot LTT 234.49 SeroYERS 159 C/INFL 63 sIgA 70 MSA 280 Bartonella Al 28 1.25 di OH VitD 7 Food allergy test 160 H2S 10 Urine test 130Total cost: 2332.21 euro. Because Himmunitas is a private institution, none of this is refunded.I guess KDM knows what he is doing so I just approved this list.A few weeks later I had to do a lactose test. Two days later a fructose test together with the above blood tests. The lactose and fructose test measure if you’re breathing out hydrogen. If so, this means that you’re missing an enzyme to process lactose/fructose. Doing this test requires measurements every 30 minutes. It takes a few hours in total. During the blood test, about 10 vials are collected (still not all that much considering the amount of tests). The tests are sent to various labs around the world. The MSA test is a stool test which you have to collect yourself, like the urine test. Before blood is collected, the assistant goes over all the tests that will be ordered. You have to sign these documents so they can legally requests payment. During this whole time you don’t visit KDM.It takes about 2 months before the blood results are in. (For me tests were done in May and the results were available in July.) This is when you visit KDM again.Beforehand, I had to do a bike test to test heart and oxygen intake capacity. This test takes about 20 minutes and requires increasing effort. The experiment is very simple. Just keep on cycling until you can’t keep up with a certain difficulty anymore.Afterwards you return to the waiting room and wait until the professor calls you in.KDM: “You’ve gone through an active Lyme infection. This has changed the flora of your bowels. You have SIBO – small intestine bacterial overgrowth. 50% of your bacteria are anaerobic, while it should only be 10%. This probably explains your high ammonia levels, which is twice as high as it should be. You are constantly poisoning yourself from the inside out.” “We’ve also detected some food allergies, but those are only secondary.” – “Have you detected any coinfections?” “No coinfections were found with our tests. I’m not going to hunt them right now.” “It makes no sense to start antibiotics against Lyme at this point. We’re going to fix your intestines first. This is done through phytotherapy. As long as Lyme stays at bay, this shouldn’t be too hard. I hope that I can send you your report today, but my assistants are complaining that they have to work 2 hours more today. You can’t work in this country anymore.” He concluded with “No worries. You’re gonna be alright.” Another very short encounter.Turns out my suspicion was right. Finally I’ve found someone that could actually help me.On Monday (instead of Friday), I received my report. It consisted of 26 pages worth of test results. The prescriptions and supplement list were added, including some directions and a food diet. KDM didn’t mention anything about this. I guess you just have to follow the instructions on paper.The results The results below can be kind of technical. The lab results are in red. Reference ranges are between [] as usual.Summary and conclusionLeucocyte formula: low amount of monocytes IMBA: normal Serum ammonia: elevated Borrelia burgdorferi Elispot LTT: positive Panel IgG for various fungi: negative Panel IgM/IgG en PCR for various zoonoses: negative PGE2: normal Immunophenotyping: normal distribution of lymphocyte subsets CD57+ lymphocytes: low in numbers Kynurenic acid: normal VEGF: normal Soluble CD14: elevated Cytokines in serum: IL-8 elevated Yersinia and Chlamydiae serology: negative Urine neurotoxin test: positive (3+) FOODStats: some food intolerances Fesces investigation: high sIgA / normal – negative Fecal microbial analysis: high % Clostridium sensu strictu, Bacteroides, Odoribacter and Clostridium IV/XI; low % BifidobacteriumThe history, the progress of the disease, complaints and the results of the laboratorium investigation of this patient belong to Post-Lyme disease. There is a Th1 -> Th2 switch present (UNT test positive) and the amount of CD57+ lymphocytes is relatively low in numbers. There are some food intolerances (secundary). He shows an intestinal dysbiosis with overgrowth of anaerobics (explains why serum ammonia is elevated). The elevated sCD14 points to increased transfection of gramnegative bacteria."
0,locarblaura,39,"I am on Day 6 of my Candida Diet and I have lost 1.4 pounds without even trying. This is without upping my exercise, without calorie-counting, without a strict cleanse. I was 136.4 at the start of the 7 days and I am now 135.0. I am 5’3, so I was not overweight, according to the BMI chart (105-140lb is considered healthy for 5’3), but I did feel like I had some extra poundage and I so excited how the fat has literally sloughed off through no real effort on my part.My Candida diet consists of meats, low-starch vegetables, candida-friendly nuts & seeds, coconut and olive oils, almond milk (homemade and store-bought), powdered stevia, and various friendly spices and seasonings. (Am I missing something?)I am choosing to go strict and am not including any grains or dairy (yet). (My positive candida albicans antibodies test coincided with a positive dairy allergy.)Directly prior to this diet, I was gluten-free, but consuming a lot of fruit, legumes, peanuts, dairy and other carbs. (My diet was already free of processed foods, caffeine, alcohol, soy, seed oils and refined sugars, so it wasn’t as dramatic a jump as some people who are coming from the Standard American Diet.)I haven’t had cravings for higher-carb foods, and if my body looks and feels great on the Candida diet, then I may never go back! (Although I look forward to making goat milk kefir.)I will update this post in another week and let you know my progress.Food Diary:day 1, 136.4 pounds, day one of probiotics (50 billion) B: tuna fish with roasted broccoli, olive oil, flax oil and green apple Snack: Almonds L: leftover turkey cutlets with cabbage Snack: walnuts D: quinoa tabbouleh with tomatoes, parsley, cukes and oil Snack: almond butter and almond milk Middle of night snack: same as aboveday 2:, 136 pounds, B: tuna fish over big veggie salad, flax oil and OACV Snack: 2 tbs ground flax seed in 3 cups water L: two eggs with olives, peppers, jalapenos, sauteed in coconut oil D: homemade chicken drumsticks in bone broth, pepper and onion curry with coconut milkday 3: 135 lb, 4am snack: almond butter, almond milk B: 30minutes before: ground flax in 2 c water; homemade chicken drumsticks in bone broth, pepper and onion curry with coconut milk L: homemade candida diet cereal (almond flour, coconut, egg, coconut oil, stevia) and almond milk Snack: 4 cups of homemade bone broth D: roasted cabbage with coconut oil, grass-fed steakday 4: 137 lb B: 30minutes before: ground flax in 2 c water; homemade candida diet cereal (almond flour, coconut, egg, coconut oil, stevia) and almond milk Snack: detox drink – olive oil, OACV, water, flax, egg yolk L: raw broccoli with coconut oil and olive oil, grass-fed steak Snack: homemade candida almond butter balls (see under Desserts in Recipes), almond milk D: homemade roast chicken with roasted onionsday 5: 135.6 (started fiber) 2 a.m: homemade candida almond butter ball and almond milk B: homemade candida diet cereal (almond flour, coconut, egg, coconut oil, stevia) and almond milk Snack: homemade candida almond butter ball, almond milk L: leftover homemade roast chicken with cooked broccoli D: homemade roast chicken with roasted onionsoctober 12, 2016 (upped fiber to three in a.m., upped probiotic to 2 caps in a.m.) day 6: 135.0 3:30a.m: homemade candida almond butter ball and almond milk B: homemade candida diet granola (see my post “Granola” in the forum under breakfasts) and almond milk L: leftover homemade roast chicken with raw cabbage, oil, OACV D: slow-cooked chicken drumsticks and non-starchy vegetables"
0,mariannefadel,40,"I have been reading a lot about baking soda and its positive effects on candida infections… Some are drinking a spoon of bicarbonate per day to regulate the acidity of their gut… And they say its very efficient, even in kicking off candida…Has anyone tried?They say we should drink to avoid candida from returningThanks"
1,Caravaggio,40,"I used it for some time but I noted it makes your stomach acid even more alkaline, but you want the opposite, because your stomach acid will probably already have too little stomach acid.But I found out it is really good to use as a mouthwash. When I drink from a glass I always see a smeary residue on the glass where my lips touched it, I think that may be Candida, though I don’t have a white coating on my tongue.I think it’s so hard to fight Candida because it can hide in 3 places, so you have to clean all 3 places at the same time: Intestines, mouth and sinuses.So if you cleaned your intestines you just swallow your saliva and it’s back in the intestines.If you cleaned your mouth it will get back into the mouth over the sinuses. If you cleaned your mouth and your sinuses it can come back over reflux. And so on.I’m gonna try this now: Viracin (tannins) for the intestines, sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) for the mouth and Xlear nasal spray (contains xylitol, saline and grapefruit seed extract).I also think PET (patulous eustachian tube) is a symptom of systemic Candida."
2,Caravaggio,40,"I noted when I do the mouthwash with sodium bicarbonate, my gums start to bleed after some days while toothbrushing. I don’t know if it is a good or bad sign.I remember some time ago when I used the toothpaste Parodontax Classic (the one without fluoride) I got the same gum bleeding. Maybe I should switch back to this toothpaste and look if the bleeding goes away if I just take it long enough. Probably it’s just healing the places where the Candida has been in the gums.Funny thing is that it is a toothpaste against gum bleeding. I found a German dissertation where it says it is the strongest inhibitor of Candida Albicans (page 31):http://www3.db-thueringen.de/servlets/DerivateServlet/Derivate-10436/KleinStarke/Dissertation.pdf"
0,Antti,41,"I am a male and have been on this food plan for about 3 months now, and all i can say is it most definitely works. I used to be a very healthy, active individual before my body succumbed to this autoimmune disease – I was a sugar addict though, which caused Candida in the first place. Before this illness i would fall ill with a common cold maybe only once a year. After Candida took hold of my body i started to have colds approximately every 6 weeks. This went on for a year. Not to mention chronic diarrhea and fungal infections in my body.Starting this diet IS hard, I’m not gonna sugarcoat it (ha!) but once you get going you will not want to look back, trust me. My health started to improve slowly but surely. As i write this i can tell that my gut continues to heal and I no longer fall ill on a regular basis. I intend to keep going for to the unforeseeable future, possibly never returning to my regular food regime.For me giving up coffee has been hard! i gave up processed sugar 2 years ago and that was a walk in the park compared to giving up coffee. So i did my research and it would appear that you can actually have one cup of coffee a day without any problems, and that is exactly what i have been doing (i know the book advises against it). It appears not to have compromised my food plan. I suppose it depends on the individual.One word of caution: I developed a Folic Acid vitamin deficiency during this plan, probably due to the fact that one is not allowed wheat during this diet. A telltale sign of the said deficiency is a burning sensation in the mouth and a very sore, scarlet red tongue. Interestingly, about 24 hours later after I started taking Folic Acid supplement the bothersome symptoms completely disappeared! In other words, make sure you get all the needed nutrients and it is best you take good quality vitamin supplements, especially vitamin B.I hope you’ve found this helpful, and I wish you luck and success, this plan is so worth it!"
1,Now Gone,41,"It is so nice to hear that someone is making progress against this annoying problem. I’ve had yeast on and off all my life, sometimes better and sometimes worse. Usually the diet would do it but last year and this year, the diet isn’t working as well and I’ve been dealing with chronic sinusitis and sore itchy ears and throat, low energy, depression, etc. I’ve just added some herbs and enzymes to destroy the bad yeast, a digestive enzyme with HCI to help improve my digestion and probiotics to restore the good yeast. I’ve been on the whole foods diet and lean meat for three weeks. Trying to lose some weight (have about 20 pounds to lose) but it’s not budging even though I am under my weight loss calorie allowance of 1200 calories a day. I also had gotten rosacea on my face but that’s starting to clear up so I am seeing a little progress. Can you be a little more specific about what you did? Thanks."
2,laurenziano,41,First I want to say sugar is not the problem. The reason that it is so dangerous is because yeast grows wildly when there is a lot of sugar in the body. When you make wine and you add yeast nothing happens but when you add sugar the yeast spreads like crazy. I have had chronic DIAHRREA worst experience of my life. Yeast is what causes DIAHRREA and fungal rot infection because yeast is an infection. Yeast causes infections-A yeast infection means the yeast is the infection. The yeast doesn’t get infected it is the infection. When you leave a loaf of bread out for a week it gets all these blue purple red yellow spots with all this mold which is mycelium and it spreads through your whole body . The way to kill yeast is ascorbic acid. I take 6.000 mg a day. With ascorbic acid you will never get a cold again. Research vitamin c benefits on internet it is the #1 vitamin because it is needed by every cell in your body and kills yeast unmercifully. I used to take 2 100 mg vitamin b but its made from brewers yeast I wo t touch it again. No yeast of any kind for me. When I stopped eating a loaf of yeasted bread a day my DIAHRREA. Stopped the next day and never came back for months now. I used to be able to eat pizza for years and years-now the yeast makes me throw up When I had chronic DIAHHREA a cup of coffee would make the DIAHRREA worse. After stopping yeasted bread now I drink 3 or 4 cups a day with two cream and now only 1 sugar and no DIAHRREA. For months. Lastly if you want to really help yourself drink a litre of milk a day it will do more for your health and stomach of all the things I’ve tried. Your body is mostly protein and milk is the ultimate protein in the world. It is the standard for protein like 24 Karat is the standard for gold. Last treasure I have found is v-8 vegetable juice . It had all those beautiful vegetables your body will love.
0,CCand,42,"Hello! 🙂I’m on candida diet now for 3 weeks. I was using on daily basis oregano oil, GSE, Candex, a little of garlic oil, Betaine HCL with meals, Pancreatine, strong probiotics and mixture of fiber (Psyllium, Inulin, Bificol, Oat fiber) 2 big teaspoons every night with 3-4 dcl of water. First 2 weeks was ok despite a few die off symptoms, but my stool was regular without a problem. After 2 weeks until now I have a constipation with daily abdominal pain and not sure what to do when it looks like even fiber is not helping. I stopped taking antifungals after this so now Im just on Betaine HCL, Pancreatine, probiotics and fiber.Is there anyone who knows what can be the cause of this? Thank you very much for any response. 🙂"

0,Chaanah,43,"Hi all. In South Africa we seem to be pretty behind when it comes to knowledge about Candida (as regards conventional medical practitioners anyway). When my health went haywire at the beginning of this year it started a journey that has taken me places I didn’t expect to go and left me wondering whether I am perhaps just a raving hypochondriac (thanks due in great part to the doctors I’ve been referred to including a gastroenterologist, a specialist neurologist and a delightful psychiatrist who told me my symptoms were a result of dissociative disorder… well hoo-flippen’-ray!) I’ve had my gallbladder removed (there were gallstones admittedly) but the symptoms continued. Rather than weight gain as a symptom, I started losing weight very rapidly in January and from 73kg I now weigh less than 58kg (I stopped checking because it’s scary and at 174cm in height I look like a death camp survivor). Some “friends” have intimated that I should eat more and stress less, that I might be “putting this on myself”. That I need to be more positive and exercise more – that will make me feel better. Sure… I agree. I just wish I had the energy to take a nice walk around the block, that my hips didn’t ache like an arthritic 75 year old (I’m 45), that I wasn’t so tired all the time. I’m afraid that if I exercise at the moment I’ll burn up what tiny bit of muscle I have. So do I have Candida? We think so… I itch (everywhere), I ache, I’m tired, my stomach doesn’t know how to behave, I have headaches, my mouth often tastes like the bottom of a rat’s nest, I get dizzy, my brain seems to have gone to goop and the skin on my face looks like I have some awful disease. I am on anti-fungals, probiotics, immune-boosters, an anti-candida diet… I have had MORE blood tests done to check for allergies. I am now seeing a doctor who practices functional medicine and is a qualified dietician (and charges non-functional, highly qualified rates) – hopefully she will be able to guide me towards my old healthy self again. Having a place to rant a bit where others have gone through similar things helps… thanks for listening. Love and strength to all of you. 🙂"
1,Chaanah,43,Thought I’d post a follow-up to my post of Wednesday.  I saw the Clinical Dietician who is treating me yesterday and she has amended my diet and I’m going to be weaning off Topamax which was prescribed for me 6 years ago in conjunction with an anti-depressant. It is very likely that the Topamax has also contributed to some of my current situation – mainly the excessive weight loss. I must say I had a good chat with her and she has given me a lot of encouragement. I realise that this is not a “quick-fix” scenario and I have to commit to behaving myself as far as what I eat is concerned. This Website and forum have been very helpful up until now and I have been grateful to have found them.
2,Yuki,43,Good luck on your journey and good job getting of Topamax. My fiance was on that and it really messed her up bigtime!Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)
3,dogwalker,43,"I am totally new to this forum. I,ve had a candida problem for probably 15 years and in 2006 did an elimination diet, finding I reacted to al most ALL of the foods I re-introduced into my diet. It was only one year ago after seeing a Dr of environmental medicine that I. Got a diagnosis. My biggest problem is eating unknowingly even a minute amount of food that causes me to have a bad headache and nausea for three days. In between these bouts, I can feel very well.However two days ago, my usual dog walk in a damp area resulted in me feeling sluggish and yawning most of the day.I know lots of you are a lot worse off. I feel lucky now to be gaining some more knowledge, but feel some support would be nice as most people I meet are clueless!"
4,orangestar,43,"@dogwalker, I can say from my current experience that it eventually gets better. I still have some candida issues but they have become much more subtle and don’t seem to get in my way anymore. It’s great to get support by people who understand and this forum seems to be a pretty friendly and positive place to spend time.One thing that’s become very clear to me is that most if not all health issues are a teacher that our soul is sending to us to help learn certain (sometimes long term) life lessons or process mental-emotional content needing to be released. Attempting to see deeply into what is happening (looking at Candida as a teacher rather than an enemy) can help you move through the lessons faster and more consciously. My belief is that when you have learned what you need to learn on a soul level from an illness, it tends to fade away or the stars align and you discover the right combination of diet and cures at the right time!For me, Candida has taught so much and I’ve learned so much along the journey that when I look back in time, the pieces seem to fit together and I appreciate who I’ve become as a result. This is all silver lining stuff, I know. It can be very hard when you’re “in the thick of it” and can’t see your way out of the cloudiness. And mainstream consciousness still doesn’t recognize Candida as “a thing” yet, so that doesn’t help! But hopefully more and more understanding is happening as people get informed or know someone with Candida.I wish you the best on your journey (and same to everyone here on the forum)"
5,laurenziano,43,READ MY POSTS IT HAS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. YEAST IS THE #1 PROBLEM PEOPLE DON’T KNOW AND IF YOU DRINK TONIC WATER STOP. QUININE TO MAKE TONIC WATER IS USED IN SOUTH AMERICA TO KILL RATS. IT IS AS BAD OR WORSE THAN ARSENIC. STOP YEAST AND DRINK A LITRE OR MORE OF WHOLE MILK A DAY AND YOUR. BODY WILL COME BACK TO NORMAL. TAKE 5000 MG A DAY OF ASCORBIC ACID IT IS THE ONLY THING THAT KILLS YEAST AND FLUSHES OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM. YOUR WEIGHT LOSS IS. YEAST OVERGROWTH. YEAST EATS YOUR FOOD BEFORE IT HAS TIME TO DIGEST AND TURNS IT INTO DIAHHREA . WHEN I WAS IN YOUR STATE I WOULD HAVE A STEAK. A STEAK NORMALLY STAYS IN YOUR STOMACH FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS SO YOU CAN GET THE NUTRITION OUT OF IT. WITH YEAST OVERGROWTH WITHIN TWO HOURS THEY HAVE EATEN THE STEAK AND TURNED IT INTO DIAHHREA. DRINK LOTS AND LOTS OF MILK AND ASCORBIC ACID AND YOU’LL GET YOUR LIFE BACK. I GOT MY LIFE BACK I HAVE BEEN THERE I KNOW EVERY STEP OF THE RETURN JOURNEY.
0,alexisMCA,44,"Wow! Since I got the “Raster” list of foods and the astrics ** anyway. I had woke up had my usual routine but added in two hard boiled eggs (antibiotic free hormone free) the expensive ones. Had the two eggs at 7am by 930 I was in such bad shape sweaty palms, sweaty feet and just dizzy feeling of being ill. Nevertheless NO EGGS for me.I feel it is a breakthrough and I am so thankful to you Raster as I hate being sick or feeling bad but rather than feel negative about all of this I would rather say I didn’t have eggs yesterday and felt great and today I did and felt shitty and know what not to eat than be in the dark.Your list of foods is so helpful.I had a bad reaction with red pepper, eggs, turkey, and spinach. Those were some of my staples before starting this anti-candida lifestyle and thanks to your list and the support here on the forums I have resolved what “works for me” and what doesn’t food wise and feel so empowered.The best part Costco: Sells the organic greens which contain no spinach only those great no astrick ** foods and I am glad because it sure as heck makes life much easier.Thanks Raster and good luck everyone you can overcome and beat this but you have to be patient and also care about yourself enough to ignore anyone else opinion that doesn’t understand and also be patient with your body. It wants to work with you but you have to let it “speak to you” LOL and embrace the good and the bad or it will be hell that is my opinion as I am now on Day 21 of the rest of my life with this lifestyle change."
1,Indrid,44,"“. . . you have to be patient and also care about yourself enough to ignore anyone else’s opinion that doesn’t understand”That’s wonderful advice, Alexis. Candida has ruined my life on every level — physically, professionally, socially, romantically, and spiritually. The fact that it’s an invisible illness has probably destroyed my sanity. It’s like we’re the only ones who know the world is round, while everybody else still thinks it’s flat and the center of the universe. We don’t want pity, only understanding. If I ever recover, I don’t think I’ll be able to trust people or be open with them again."

Quality vs quantity.I had a few today say something silly about the eggs being a “non issue” how the hell do they know is it their body that is having the allergic reaction the answer NO!

0,Yvie,45,"Last January I went on a full-fledged attack on my candida. Began with probiotics, garlic and apple-cider vinegar each morning, kale and fish twice daily cooked in Coconut oil, exercise and so much more. I even made my own sauerkraut! Needless to say I suffered the “die-off” so badly that I went back to my usual ways by March. I suffer mainly from skin rashes all over my body that began last year and have evolved to a suicidal level. I am attempting once again but VERY VERY VERY slowly. Today I am simply using garlic in most of my meals and cut out sweets and fruits. I have subscribed to the newsletter and look forward to the next message. I am also a struggling artist so I can’t afford the probiotics that people normally buy. Question: is yogurt as effective and how much do I need to take? Bottom line is I am hoping to be able to overcome this on a pauper’s budget. Any suggestions? Thanks,."

3,chrisluketaylor,45,I spend £40-50 a week on my nutrition and supplementation. What is your budget?
4,Yvie,45,"Thanks for asking Chris. My husband provides for me and my son on a very humble salary. I check for the weekly “best value” items when shopping for food. We can’t always afford a full grocercy order and often have to use fillers when cooking such as pasta, potatoes and bread. I guess $100.00 per week would be accurate for a family of 3 adults. The probiotics sold in Canada usually go for anywhere from 2-5 dollars per pill….something I couldn’t possibly afford."
5,chrisluketaylor,45,"Food prices over that side of the atlantic are different, fresh food is seemingly far more expensive that side of the pond.My most costly items on my shopping list are 4kg of chicken for £10.00 and 300ml organic extra virgin coconut oil for £6.00 and 750g of toasted almond flakes for £8.55I buy all my veg frozen apart from my celery and cauliflowers (which I like to grate and use as a rice substitute in meals).Avrg food per week (just myself):1kg frozen brocolli – 90p 1kg frozen whole leaf spinach – £1.20 1kg frozen green beans – £1.10 2 cauliflower – £2.00 1kg frozen cabbage – £1.20 2 celery – £1.60 1kg natural yoghurt (5 strain) – £4.00 4kg chicken thighs and drums – £10.00 28 eggs – £3.50 organic extra virgin coconut oil (350ml)- £6.00 400g pumpkin seeds – £3.20 16L of mineral water – £2.50 20 bags of nettle tea – £1.20 10 bags of peppermint tea – 90p 1/4 jar of chickory root coffee – 60p 1/3 jar cinnamon powder – 80p 1/3 jar of garlic granules – 60p 1/3 jar of dried rosemary – 70p 180g of whey protein isolate – £3.20Thats about £44 per week for myself (I cant get the same quality nutrition for cheaper, here in the UK).My capsule probiotics are £18 for 60 (7strain with garlic and GSE), but the store owner threw in 20 extra 11 strain capsules last time (I have a good health food shop in my village). So that worked out about 23p per capsule (46p a day or £3.22 per week).Other supplementation I use:Cod liver oil – 50p per week multivitamin – 70p per week oregano oil – 90p per weekSo in total I’m spending about £50 per week on everything.The method I used to optimise my costs was to calculate how much each meal I had in a week cost.I found that meals I had with beef or steak were much more expensive than chicken so scrapped them (only real downside is less L-carnitine in my diet now). Meals with salad were also costlier, and not really as good nutritionally compared to spinach (which I have every day) – so scrapped them also. Meals with fish (frozen alaskan pollock is the cheapest for me) worked out less costlier than chicken, but takes up valuable freezer space and has low levels of mercury in so I don’t bother with it.Breakfast was the cheapest meal for me (eggs, seeds, broccoli and celery), averaging out at £1.80 but lunches and dinners were more expensive due to consumption of yoghurt and toasted almonds aswell as chicken and veg averaging out at £3.00 for each meal."

8,alexisMCA,45,"Hang in there! Die-Off SUCKS! I am a starving student so get the idea about the funds and the probiotics. They should be covered by health insurance is my opinion or paid for by the tard doctors that prescribed the antibiotics to me over the past few years instead of looking for a alternative cause of the skin rashes I had.I am on day 9 of anti-candida diet with the addition of meat I had some hormone antibiotic free beef recently. Lost 5 pounds already (needed to lose it) but it was not what I expected. I also took 1 entire packet/sachet of the VSL3 a whooping 450 billion cultures at once now BAD die-off side effects sweating, cold, that dizzy but not room spinning feeling. But I learned lesson and can say that 2 days from that probiotic OD I am feeling better. I am still not the “strong self” I remember but definitely helpful.Anti-fungals to try: garlic odorless gel tabs cheap 2.99 on vitacost I take 1 a day and Caprylic because I have leaky gut too and doctor put me on caprylic last year. I put 1 clove of garlic in my green slime drink in the morning so if I do that I may not take the garlic gel tabs – have enough etcProbiotics: I make my own saukercraut like you and also drink that expensive kumbacha tea in the bottle from the czeh republic I put my self in debt over it but it tastes good and the VSL3 I am doing but 1/4 of a packet and spacing at least 2 hours from anti-fungals above.If I can help or keep you from going over the edge just message. I understand the die-off and the frustration. I had such bad die-off last year when I started diflucan and before nystatin elevated my liver enzymes and the PA I had never told me that there was a die-off and if I had known I probably would have stayed on it and adjusted but better than I understand more now -everything happens for a reason.Before finding this “forum and literature” I paid BIG money for a physician assistant to prescribe me anti-fungals and supplements but he didn’t explain the die-off and I was instructed to eat lentils, brown rice, potatoes and the like, foods on the avoid list so I lost all faith in this person.So hang in there! It is worth it to stay the course and when you don’t feel well just remember there are a lot of us who feel like shit too and are right there with you rooting you on!You can do this! Here is to your health!I am not a doctor nor want to be one! So my opinion is just a lay person who has an opinion which may be ignored LOL"
9,Yvie,45,thank you Alexis
10,alexisMCA,45,"I am taking the NOW fiber regularly (lol no pun intended) that is suggested here and today I feel finally good. Not perfect yet but I had bad day yesterday day 12 of the new diet and think may be the candidate stuff was too much so none of that today just regular supps, anti-candida diet along with a small amount of VSL3 and fiber and believe I may have gotten through the die-off. I hope so.Have no plans of going back to anything that will harm my health."
0,alexisMCA,46,"I am on day 6 of the anti-candida diet but not the cleanse. I am eating only non-candida foods with the exception I had hormone free antibiotic free beef 1x per month is the plan, eggs is a staple of my routine to replace the lentils that I was eating prior too understanding that they were not helpful. My skin is already improved I had a chronic rash on my face its gone and the redness is already nearly invisible so I know what I am doing is on the right track.Day 6 Antifungals began: I started oil of oregano, garlic gel tabs because they are odorless I want to have some friendships LOL, and caprylic acid. Oil of oregano is strong I immediately felt the “taste” and will only be taking that 1x per week and may be even rotating. The other two I have had before and discontinued not understanding that they were part of the anti-candida diet and should be part of my plan until I am symptom free to say the least. Caprylic I elected to stick with strongly because of the fact it is also great for “leaky gut” and that is something I am aware of.Probiotics: I ordered the VSL3 the “packets” will start that as soon as they arrive and go slowly 1 packet every other or more because it is a whopping dose of probiotics 450billion and don’t want to be die-off overload.Teas/Drinks: I am drinking lemon water, nettle tea, dandelion tea and peppermint tea all of which are now part of my staples and will continue for the rest of my life because I like tea and as long as there are no bad side effects from them I shall continue.Fiber: I ordered the Fiber selected here it was cheap and easy on Amazon and taking that at least 1x per day because I cannot cleanse with the clay and do the liver tonic regularly yet because of the acute phase I am in it was common sense for me to start the candida diet, anti-fungal routines, probiotics and get stronger before I try to do anything that brash.Overall: I feel the impact of the changes and the die-off I am not myself mentally or physically but definitely going to continue and go slowly and understand this is a long difficult process but worth the effort.Future: I will never take another antibiotic again unless it is an absolute last resort and will not ever eat gluten free pasta, breads or any chips or crackers. Not worth it. I don’t miss that part because I feel they led to weight gain anyway and now that I understand not safe for candida why do it. Not worth it."
0,Maiscout,47,"I decided to actually keep a candida journal. It was hugely helpful to me in the beginning reading the stories of others with candida, but unfortunately most people seem to write a couple posts and then disappear, so you’re left wondering if they got better or just gave up. Anyway, I’m at the beginning of my story so I thought I would actually update this in the future to help others (if I actually beat this thing!) Firstly my history: I believe I have had candida for the last 5 years. I was pretty healthy throughout my childhood, think I had antibiotics maybe once or twice for tonsillitis? But then at age 17 I got glandular fever (mono). My doctor believed I had tonsillitis again and gave me antibiotics (obviously a big mistake!) However, it could be that I had candida before this, and the candida led to the glandular fever? Who knows. Around this time I also started taking the contraceptive pill and had the cervical cancer vaccinations so overall I’m pretty sure it was down to something when I was 17 My symptoms: My symptoms are pretty mild overall when compared to others. I came across the candida symptoms when looking for a reason for my sudden onset of IBS symptoms. so my symptoms for the last five years are -Recurrent thrush (a couple times a year very mildly) -Recurrent UTI’s (probably around 2-3 a year for the last few years. Last one took months to get rid of) -Post nasal drip and bad breath -Mildly dry eyes, blurry vision and light sensitivity -Constipation, gas and bloating -Dust and mold allergy  -Gastritis once a couple years ago -General tiredness but nothing major -Tinea versicolor on my chest Weeks 1-5 So I have been on the anti candida diet for the last 5 weeks. The first two weeks I felt unbelievably weak and tired. Had some die off for the first couple days which was mostly feeling dizzy and sick. Started anti-fungals two weeks ago. Hair started becoming quite greasy and hair is itchy with dandruff, getting spots on my face, UTI symptoms are back, major anxiety and depression for a couple days. Felt pretty decent for a few days. Spots cleared up and hair wasn’t itchy. Then I started started taking probiotics (homemade goats milk kefir) this week. Anxiety and paranoia are back, itchiness, dry eyes, UTI still there!, itchy butt, constipation, stomach aches. Is this normal? I hope so. Anyway, will be seeing a naturopath for the first time this week so I can hopefully get some guidance on what I’m doing right or wrong! What I’ve been taking so far: Antifungals: -Coconut oil -Rutubaga (swede) -SF722 -Pau d’arco -Diatomaceous earth (not sure if this counts as antifungal but oh well) Supplements: -Milk Thistle -Molybdenum -Magnesium citrate -Aloe Vera -Vitamin C 3000mg So that’s all for post one."
1,caterina81,47,"Hiya, I am going to be doing the same with a update, its nice to see others story’s I started Saturday. I’m sure you know but make sure your Vit C doesn’t have any added sugars or worst Maltodextrin, gosh i made the mistake yesterday and my trush went mental and I was doing so well. I too feel mentally very low but then super high..its weird. Good luck! Look forward to reading your updates 🙂 Cat x"
2,maiscoutagain,47,"I haven’t been able to log in to update this, so finally created a new profile.Anyway, it turned out to be heavy metals. I have a copper imbalance and mercury. I am currently chelating so hoping my candida will disappear in time!"
3,orangestar,47,"@maiscoutagain, how are things going? Did you get any relief by working with the heavy metals? Candida is such a complex and every morphing journey sometimes. It’s fascinating what it teaches us."
0,Seashell,48,"Why I am/was on the diet: Recurring vaginal yeast infections (that hurt my relationship with my partner and even more so my self-esteem) for just over a year. Tried everything else – cotton underwear, better washing routines, no shaving and so much more – nothing helped.How I went about the diet: I tried to start with a cleanse but seeing as I had an extremely unhealthy diet before, switching to only vegetables seemed impossible to readjust to, so I budged on the first day and went straight into the “normal” Candida diet. I’m quite proud to say that I stuck to it almost without cheating for three months (there were some glasses of red wine here and there) and then I started to transition back to normal food (I’m still transitioning by the way).Antifungals: In the beginning of the diet I took an antifungal pill (Diflucan) at first three times one week, and thereafter once every week for 9 weeks. After that I didn’t take any antifungals. However I tried to be mindful of the foods with antifungal properties mentioned on the site, like garlic, coconut oil and turmeric.Probiotics: I also took (and still take) probiotics every day, mostly twice a day. In the beginning I used Probion Daily, but then I switched to Innate Flora 20 – 14. The Innate Flora ones are more expensive, but also a lot more effective. (I also got into the habit of taking a multivitamin pill every day, because hey – it couldn’t hurt, right?)My experience: In the beginning it was of course hard to stick to the diet, and the hardest thing for me was having to always plan my meals, and never being able to go out and eat with my friends and boyfriend. I had cravings in the beginning, but they got more bearable as time passed. I noticed that my tastebuds had changed – simple things like walnuts suddenly seemed to have a really sweet taste to me! A really important thing if you want to be able to stick to this diet is variation – of course you’ll feel bored and more prone to cheat if you only eat salad every day! Also, the recipes on this site is truly golden, especially all the dessert ones (and I looove the falafel recipe as well!).I lost weight also, and strangely enough some weight just transitioned from being belly fat to hip fat (I even got stretch marks) – but I like the look of big hips, so I actually liked that! My dad told me my skin looked great and that I looked really fit and healthy, which is always nice to hear.I’m now in the process of transitioning back to normal food – I eat rice crackers (made of unmilled rice), pasta made of beans and chickpeas, and I have even started eating regular nachos and crisps lately. And the best part of it all – I’ve been infection free since I started the treatment and there’s no sign of it coming back~"
0,SimonWontGiveUp,49,"I’m 38 years old and over the past few years i have experienced and array of symptoms. Jock itch, nail fungal, Rosacea, Hives, Headaches, Depression & Anxiety but to name a few. Like many people I finally realised that the doctors would only treat the symptoms with an array of antibiotics for the problems to manifest with a month or two. Why? Because I continued eating the same high sugar/carbohydrate diet that caused the problem in the first place.I was addicted three or four chocolate bars a day, four flat whites, croissants, burgers chips and bread. I would be either high on sugar or low searching for it.I drew a line in the sand when huge spots starting appearing all over my face. I went to see a nutritionist who did a urine test to check the levels of the various strains of yeast within my gut. Guess what it was some of the highest she had seen.Skeptical I did two separate food allergy tests and both came back as yeast, milk and coconut intolerant.And lastly I did some normal blood tests which came back with high cholesterol at 7.2 but everything else except Vit d within the normal range.The results were in I was in a poor state and had to do something.I was 5ft 11in and 87kg when I started. I started by juicing for three days and after the third day my legs felt as though they were on fire I could barely walk, looking back this was clearly too much strain within a short space of time. So I started eating just vegetables, brown rice and meat or fish. Coupled with some supplements i got off the Internet. Within days I was getting pains all over my body, numbness, brain fogg, I couldn’t concentrate it was he’ll. I also cheated by saying maybe I can eat normally when I’m out for dinner. I believe this made the die off continue. I was seeing progress, I had no sugar cravings, my spots died down, my Jock itch disappeared and my energy levels increased. However these were replaced by severe health anxiety because of the constant pains. For me the die off has been he’ll. But I had not been doing it properly I work in a job where entertaining is the done thing. I wouldn’t eat deserts but I would eat pretty much everything else on the menu providing there was no yeast, additionally i was still drinking two flat whites a day. I had lost weight and most of the original issues but these die off symptoms would not go away. Until three weeks ago, I got serious. I told my work, friends and family I would not be eating out for three months as I’m on a strict diet. I started the paleo diet with oregano and calpric acid supplement, coupled with specific probiotics lactobacillus GG & Saccharomyces Boulardii. Three weeks in and I’m sympton free I weigh 75kg which is about 22 bmi and my skin is looking fresh. Additionally my cholesterol is 4.8 I must have been doing something right.The key is persistence and eventually giving in, no cheating just veg, nuts and organic meat/hook and line caught fish.I have given in and now over Christmas am I seeing clear results.I have six weeks to go and I will get another test to check my 3-oxoglutaric, tartaric, arabinose and hipperuric yeast levels.I’m keen to hear anyone’s views around my experience."
0,taylorgillespie21,50,"So I have been trying to figure out what was wrong with me for a year now. I have been having a broad range of symptoms that were engulfing my life. The symptoms included dizziness,anxiety,depression,anger, mood swings, constipation,allergies,diarrhea,ringing in my ears,sweaty palms,brain fog, and many more. I went to every doctor and they all just ordered tests and the teats would always come back normal. Going to all these different doctors and hearing nothing is wrong with you is the most discouraging hopeless thing I could hear. Especially when they wanted to put me on antidepressanta or said I needed to speak to a coubselor. I knew something was wrong with me and I needed to know before i couldnt tale it anymore. I finally found out I had candida from a holistic doctor. I also found out my progesterone levels are extremely low. The combination of low progesterone and candida heightened the symptoms even more making my anxiety and dizziness unbearable. Now I am on the candida diet, taking probiotics, using drops to kill the yeast, and I’m using progesterone cream. Even though I now know I have candida it hasn’t made it any easier. The die off symptoms are brutal and sometimes my anxiety gets so bad I feel like I can’t be normal. I look back over the year and it makes me so sad how kong I’ve felt this way. Every day I have waken up and felt weird and just off and not myself. There’s days where I would rather die then be alive. Life is so hard when you can’t control your emotions or you’re health. It’s so scary not being in control. The day I feel better will be the best day of my life. But some days I just want to give up."
1,zarina,50,I understand. I have been through a lot of things like this too. It really sucks. Hang in there. You matter.
2,taylorgillespie21,50,Thank you I’m trying the best I can. It’s nice to know I’m not the only one going through this.
0,stifoo,51,"So, I just found out for sure I had a candida infection. Likely had it for 10 years! Got a blood test.I’m so excited by my results I thought I would share to encourage others. I am 35 and felt like I was 60…screw you candida. Ideas on how I got it…too much drinking, poor diet, lots of dairy, sugar and stress. Oh, and I used to smoke to boot. over 10 Doctors in a row (including emergency hospital visits)basically told me I was hypochondriac. Tried to put me on every antidepressant in the world. Left me with a UTI for 6 mos because it didn’t “show” on their new, stupid paper dip test. Finally did some research and decided to lie to new Dr. Told them I had rare type of UTI that didn’t show on normal tests and required them to look under microscope and run culture…guess what…UTI FOUND! Permanent damage to urethra. Pee just a little now when I sneeze hard sometimes (never had kids) Gave western medicine the royal finger about 4 years ago and never looked back. Give me the internet and a naturopath any day. I went on diflucan, now on nistatin and on a strict no sugar, vinegar (except for apple cider vinegar)wheat, mushrooms etc. On day 28 and here are list of symptoms (some that I had no idea were candida until they were suddenly gone!) and progress made: No more strange vertical wrinkles on chest…developed them at about 27 (now 35) and thought was very strange…2 weeks in I noticed they suddenly disappeared! WOW Face skin much less dry..still have 25% to go to feel like its better enough that I don’t have to slick down with cocoa butter every 5 min just to feel normal. Lower back pain….GONE! It came on slowly and then was almost crippling. Was saving money to go to chiropractor..thought it was scoliosis kicking in…nope Candida Weird, random neck, chest and chin acne GONE GONE GONE constant UTI feeling…GONE Vaginal yeast infection…mostly gone…no odor, almost no discharge, very little itching Strange dry, itchy rash with little bumps between and under breasts..GONE Random dandruff attacks…gone little dry elbow patches…mostly gone swelling hands…gone brain fog….THANK F”ING GOD GONE GONE GONE SEVERE CRIPPLING ANXIETY….Much better..small bouts…easily cured with 2 doses 200 mg niacin….Niacin is now my BFF…same reaction as if I just took valuim but no drowsy and actual energy..Please Please Please read up on niacin if you have anxiety, depression or OCD…Will save your life. Tired all the time…NOPE! So much energy!! Awful cuticles and hang nails…mostly gone..still have bouts Bizarre, painful eyelash follicle infections when wear eyeliner or eye makeup just on left eye…GONE Frequent, Random urge to start crying my eyes out but period not due or even close….GONE Dry feet…mostly gone but we can do better Dry hands (just on the back) still there but slowly getting better Lack of thirst…a little better but still wish I didn’t have to force myself to drink water or herbal tea…Just never thirsty..so strange…only drink tulsi (holy basil) tea now with a tiny bit of stevia. random bad breath…GONE Random episodes of hair thinning…GONE Strong/strange smelling pee…GONE Willpower/urge to fight bad habits…. 110% Strange lingering sleep wrinkles in face…much better…hoping will disappear like chest wrinkles Weight gain…NOPE…lost 15 lbs…I’m normally 5’7″ and 120 – 125…got up to 175 and so lethargic…28 days and now 160 and kicking ass..Walking everywhere like PUSHHHT..that was nothinn… urge to do dishes and normal chores – RETURNED! House is no longer a disaster 🙂 Strange lumps in lower back and one in mid back…DECREASING..but very slowly…OUT OUT damn lumps!! Dizzyness – GONE Ringing in ears – mostly gone…still happens sometimes Dark red ear wax, achy ears, itchy ears – 90% gone Aching hip joints like old person…mostly gone but right hip still a bit stiff in certain positions dry lips…this one still plagues me…still have such dry lips…want my lips back 🙁 hoping this symptom backs off soon…lips will just dry out and then i have the urge to pick and peel the skin off…over and over again…for now I just wear heavy lipgloss all the time and it keeps it ok feeling. So, i found out that the ringing in ears, earwax and dizzy were mainly from dairy allergy…no dairy, no problem…the rest is candida but the diet is amazing for my body! Gonna stay on a version of it for life. I’m NEVER going back to feeling that way!!! EVER. Ok…now that’s some progress…age 35, did feel 60, now feel 35! Headed for 20 🙂 Things I miss right now very badly… Cheese bananas raisins coffee (decaf) If anyone knows of a banana “flavor” that won’t poison me I’d love to try it. Hope this story helps someone feel less alone and less crazy. Things that make me feel better instantly if i start feeling sorry for myself: Pay it forward – Go to that coffee shop you used to love and buy a large latte for whoever walks in next. Leave before anyone comes in and don’t peek. Imagine who it was and their reaction…this is fun for at least a day or 3. Yes, I’m living vicariously. Indulge – Treat self to massage with money saved from lack of food I am now unable to eat at restaurants. Cha CHING! Sleep in, take random day off for no reason. I work for myself so it’s a bit easier for me to do but I’m so glad I did when I feel a pouty face is immanent. Make delicious food for friends or family. I know it sounds sadistic but its the vicarious thing again. Crave a food? Make SO much of it for someone. Smell all the goodness and work so hard to make it perfect get too tired to eat it when done…Works every time. Ever cooked thanksgiving dinner and then not wanted/been to tired to eat it? yea…works on regular dinner too. ok…that’s it for now…chin up and keep rockin!"
1,runmillerun,51,"your post was adorable. i am near 35 too. Can’t even begin to tell you how much I can relate. I am 18-19 days in and so many issues I had are gone, gone, gone. Thanks for your post. Just a question can you tell me more about your diet. As in what are you eating now. I just wanted to compare. Thanks again!"
2,stifoo,51,"Ok…so it’s day 60 something…had to go back on Diflucan again…5 days on Nistatin and symptoms came RAGING back…I mean like I had just somehow PISSED it off. Now, same symptoms resurging coming off diflucan switching to Nystatin. Worst, most depressing symptoms that come back are: brain fog, exhaustion, heart palpitations, dry mouth, bad taste, dry eyes and ANXIETY OH MY GOD ANXIETY… Found out I had been deficient in vitamins too that didn’t show up on blood tests. I’m thinking either dr’s don’t know how to read these things or the lab “standards” are written for a mouse. Again, the way I tell is to go off one vitamin at a time to see what comes back…here are my deficiencies and symptoms…(which is also indicative that your bowels aren’t making enough vitamins out of your food!) Vitamin B Complex – Helps energy and significant reduction in small red bumps all over back of arms, legs and butt (non itchy) Vitamin A – Hair grows back thick and shiny when on it, and all floaters in eyes disappear (another middle finger to doctors that say this is just what happens in your 30’s) Niacin 1000 milligrams per day – helps with brain fog, anxiety and dropped all belly fat…cut back on Niacin, get belly fat, anxiety worsens and hard to think. Magnesium 2400 milligrams(this is not normal but because of die-off need this much magnesium to go to bathroom normally) Vitamin D, stops ringing in ears and I cant tell what else but im always chronically low in it so i’m staying on it. Plus, it takes forever to kick in again once I go off enough for symptoms to come back…now gotta deal with constant, light, high pitched, ringing ears for like a month or two! So, clearly I had more research to do because i was NOT going to live like this while I pray that the antifunglas do a good job. It makes no sense to me to be on such a strict diet just to have symptoms resurge in DAYS. So, diet may help by not hurting but wont do it alone and antifungals clear but only temporarily. hmmmm something is still missing…give body right thing get right result…this is INCORRECT result….so this is incorrect thing. Now modifying diet on food at a time and adding LOTS of probiotics plus some other helpers 🙂 Dove into books on healing the gut. This is where I suspect these nasty little fungus are hiding and they had to come from an imbalance somewhere so why not the gut? Have all the symptoms for leaky gut, weird allergies that develop at 30 something, tired all the time, strange aches and joint pain, but NOT the classic ones like IBS or flatulence… Thinking I like this idea of going more hard core on some diet items and less on others. Gonna use myself as guinea pig to figure it out. First, I’m ordering some threelac until I get my other probiotics from Dr Ohhira (reminds me of Star Trek for some reason) in…did a ton of research on correct strains and his look awesome, plus no need to refrigerate! Then going to try (first) a juicing diet with some oils and foods to heal bowels, then, if no better will try no vegetables and mostly meat with same herbs etc…what ever i eat has to be VERY easy to digest to heal gut (I have read anyway)…All else fails I will go on tea and avocado diet for 3 weeks (plus regimen i am researching including digestive enzymes). I would just fast but I cant take that much time off work so, avocados for me 🙂 I’ll log back in next month or when someone writes for the next update…wish me luck…ugh1 user thanked author for this post.  5Roseray5"

Well, No vinegar (except apple cider), no sugar (i use stevia in crushed leaf form cuz the other stuff tastes like nutri sweet. Im also growing it…yum!)and i mean NO SUGAR, no honey, no maple syrup, no cane juice no no no. light on starches, no corn, no potato, no processed foods, all organic, no wheat, light on rice, no white rice no mushrooms no yeast no fermented food, no dairy, no caffiene. Some of this makes no sense to me so im changing it up. Been on for 60 days and no drastic improvement from diet alone. I’m researching fermented foods because if I ferment in apple cider it should make good bacteria and food easier to digest. I’m also researching coffee and caffine, sounds fishy to me…coffee is not sugar and had lots of good things for you in it and if you are as tired as me sometimes you just need your brain to WORK. So, if not abusing it then have not found one concrete reason to not…like all else, will try it…if bad results i’ll stop..no biggie. Also considering adding bananas back in because lack of potato makes me crave them for potassium and I get shakey as hell on no potassium…thinking i can eat fruit…as long as in moderation…fruit is SO good for you."
4,stifoo,51,Oh and forgot to mention lost total of 22 lbs now on the 60 day mark:)
5,runmillerun,51,"stifoo… you totally crack me up when i read your posts. Reading others issues makes me want to press on. Its a constant and relentless battIe! Perhaps I can offer some advice because it seems we have a similar situation. I can relate so much to your posts! I reasearch and experiment in my past time. Great on quitting smoking. Cigs are loaded with fungus. I would NOT add bananas if you can help it. it is like miracle frow for the candida. There are other things you can get potassium from. i know this will help you because it helped me and you get a lot of potassium from it. drink 1 TBSP of apple cider vinegar (organic and not pasturized) “with the mother two times daily. cut it wih 6-8oz water. Get the book “body ecology” by donna gates. She is so phenomonal. The book has really helped me!!!!! She focuses on the full and entire story– like the “missing piece” you had mentioned. There need to be particular steps taken. You are correct, diet alone will not work. She addresses this. Digestive enzymes help a lot. I take them before I eat anything. It helps. I have leaky gut as well and you are so correct when you say that it’s healing the gut. It took a long time to get this toxic, it will be a long battle to heal. Sucks but it is what it is. She also talks a ton about kefier and probiotic veggies… a ton about food combining which so many people don’t realize feeds the yeast too.Improper food combining makes gas and the yeast live off that too. If you have gas or bloating=yeast are being fed. Eating starch only with probiotic, fermented veggies or green vegetables (low starch vegs) only. eating 80 veggies and 20 % meat is highly suggested. Also eat meat with greens— no starch! Eat protein in the middle of your day and the safe grains (quinoa, amarth, oat bran?, millet at night/dinner) What also might help you is having a no sugar blended green with all kinds of things all under 1/2 tsp –clove, turmeric, pau d arco powder. THis is something I have done every morning for 3 weeks and it seems to be helping a ton. My rituals are the oregano oil (4 drops under tounge), apple cider vin. twice with water, coconut oil, pau d arco tea (drink this often throughout the day. It’s like you have to attack it from all angles, crooks and crannies. I am taking yeast defense which helps too. It has a combo of all kinds or fungal fighters in it. Juicing may help you because it is about healing the gut that is damaged and demineralized. I was always so constipated and just thought it was normal. Explore old dude… Norman Walker– he is incredible and wrote so so so mnay small books on juicing and live to 117 years old. There is juicer he created called the NORWALK– get it norman walker. I totally get how frustrating it is to be on such a strict diet and then with just a small slip up be screwed with all of the return of candida evil. But stay strong and journal everything you try. It is tedious but I know people that have had to heal themselves this way. I hate to mention this but enemas every few days can help a lot and I am going to be trying the sauna 4-5 days a week soon. I know that helps a lot with the detox. Well I must be going. Keep posting. Thanks for the reply and thanks for your tips. I will try the niacan. Did you get headaches by chance? Make sure you support your kidneys and liver in this whole process. Go slow and steady. It’s easy to get in a hurry as when you are feeling better you just want to feel better and better. Good luck!"
6,TheChosenOne,51,"Great post. Nice to hear that you are doing very well! Did you fix your candida in just 60 days? :p Thank you for the Niacin tip. I read the Andrew Cutler on amalgam illness, which mentions it for anxiety and depression. I should try this. Coffee can contain mold. It also drains the adrenals. But according to the enthusiasm of your post, you don’t seem to have problems with your adrenals. So, you did supplements, the diet and diflucan and nystatin. Did you try something else? Natural antifungals? It’s a very good idea to add probiotics. The lack of them might be the reason why your candida comes back so fast. Did you do a detox? It is possible that your body is too toxic to handle the candida. Also, protect your liver by taking milk thistle extract, molybdenum and dandelion root tea."

I have friends that LIVE (for many years)on potatoes,oranges,and most of all bananas….they regularly show their blood tests to prove that potassium does NOT cause problems in the form of whole foods.

I have also used it in the past to help with reflux. I’m still researching it to combat yeast, though I know it helps create good bacteria 🙂 Kiefer is also something i am researching now and I am experimenting with Threelac I bought on Amazon. Very impressed with results…took away nasty taste in mouth that I’ve been fighting for months by brushing with salt and baking soda…UGGHHHHH I’m totally down with enemas, just gotta get the stuff and, like anything else, experiment by only doing it while not introducing anything new, then taking it away. Mom has been doing it with stepdad…they lost SOOOO much weight and that plus juicing (Gerson Diet) rid my stepdad of his sleep apnea and chronic, debilitating asthma! SO I have seen it work, though it did take 6 months before all the weight came off and the apnea and asthma went away. No, I don’t get headaches on Niacin…why do you? I would like to try sauna plus niacin like the Scientology reportedly do. Not int their ways but like some of the medical ideas. I do keep hearing to eat fermented vegetables. My dr says to avoid all fermented food and I’m very conflicted about this. She says fermented foods feed yeast but everything else I read says they are amazing for building good gut health. I could use some extra help on this one…can you point me to more info? Thanks!"

I read the Andrew Cutler on amalgam illness, which mentions it for anxiety and depression. I should try this… OMG I wish I cured it in 60 Days!! But alas..this seems to be just the beginning of my strange journey. Hopefully there is a princess I can save at the end…unless…..I. am. the. princess….err whatever. Yes, Niacin really helped my anxiety. I would not say cured because the anxiety really is tied to my fungal load…did I just say that? FUNGAL LOAD…..LOLOLOLOLOLOL ok…well, I mean when I get a flush of symptoms my anxiety gets worse no matter if I’m taking the nicain or not, but without the niacin it’s constant and very bad. Oh, and don’t believe the BS about flushes only lasting 10 minutes or that you flush the same no matter how much you take. Start SLOWLY. I took a 500 milligram by accident and I thought I was going to die for like 4 hours…I repeat, start slowly and build it up…unless you like the feeling of your eyeballs being pricked by a thousand needles and then exploding in a hot fire of burning while your intestines do a death dance around your cervix…if you have a cervix that is. Yeah, on the probiotice. Threelac is working. Never had one work this fast…researching others… Contrary to my enthusiasm I actually have a huge problem with my adrenals…If I stress out at all I can sleep for 3 days straight, and coffee often makes me deathly tired. It’s like someone squeezes all my “cope” juice out and I become a cantankerous, 85 year old hypochondriac with narcolepsy…not a good combo. I’m 5 days off diflucan of 100 milligrams daily for 30 days and on Nystatin 3 times a day. Last time I did this I crashed so hard that I actually cried when I took my last diflucan pill and said good bye to my family in case the old me came back and I was out of commission for months. But the probiotics seem to be helping or easing the decent…but more likely helping. After I finish 3 months on Nystatin I will switch to natural antifungal. Any reccommendations for research? I was advised not to do a detox and to decolonize first. Can’t rememebr why. Been drinking 4+ cups a day of red clover tea to encourage light. continual detox anyway though. Will look into Milk thistle, molybdenum and dandelion root tea. Tried dandelion root tincure as a diruetic a while back with no effect. Maybe it’s better as a detoxifying agent? Thanks!"

13,stifoo,51,"Ok…thanks for all the replies. I’ll do another update since I’m here. On day 75 or so. Just cried when I took my last diflucan and kissed my husband an family goodbye incase I crashed again…then, to my amazement, here I am 5 days later and NO CRASH! 😀 What changed? I think it was the Threelac. I ordered it from Amazon after researching a particular strain that sounds like the bug that gives you strep throat. Within 4 doses I could taste food again and all bitter tongue was GONE! Can’t believe it really…still waiting for resurgence and keeping a wary eye on hope that it’s gone but after 5 continuous days of no bad taste I think maybe it worked 😀 So, a few other symptoms came back a bit but NOTHING like the last crash. Got a few floaters in eyes, lower back and right hip a little sore, still have constipation all the time and cramping after I eat sometimes but am able to pop awake in the morning instead of my usual death wish for all perky morning things and humans…especially humans. Pop awake about 7:30 am and start to get very tired around 7:30pm. good 12 hour day though so not bad. I do get VERY cranky and brain foggy if I try to function past 8pm at night. It’s like a bad Disney adaptation of Cinderella. “Every night at the stroke of 8pm, the fairy godmother’s magical dust wears off and Fungerella POOFS into her old crone self full of curses and hatred for all living things. I really get confused and overtired quickly. Last night I cried because I was cold and just wanted to get into bed but there were dog hairs on my blanket and all the blankets were in this mass confusion that made me feel hopeless in untangling them. So a quiet tear rolled down my cheek as I dutifully grabbed the sticky roller and got to work. Yes, i could have grabbed my husband but I was just too tired to walk back out and explain why I needed help again. Besides, my tired brain always decides that if he can’t figure out I need help at bedtime I will just be that angry marter and cry the dog hair off my OWN GODDAMN BLANKET THANK YOU VERY MUCH. This always makes for a funny story the next day and is infinitely better than just saying F**k it and going to bed all dirty…so there are some pluses… Weight is magically down to 150…nice lips are still peeling every day in this bizarre ritual shedding…quite like a snake sheds I think…snake lips…but my face skin is OH so much better and body skin seems to be recovering nicely which is awesome. I ATE BACON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL AND DELICIOUS. I have recently discovered hemp milk and quinoa milk. DELICIOUS in tea. Great coffee replacement. Quinoa milk reminds me of pretzels…so like, pretzel tea but hemp milk is smooth and wonderful. I love coconut milk but it always tastes funny in tea…like its too watery or something and noes nothing to smooth out or mute the flavor but hemp milk is heavenly. Made an awesome creation. !0 eggs, coconut flower, baking soda, zest of 2 lemons, one cup coconut oil, 1 cup coconut flakes (unsweetened), 3/4 cup lemon juice and 14 drops of stevia baked at 350 for 40 minutes made what i would consider the best most confusing bread cake I have ever eaten. Its not very sweet but the bit of stevia takes the edge off. Its crumbly like corn bread but a little more moist like that bread you make for strawberry shortcake. So I made backed chiken with onions and cooked down some frozen strawberries into a glaze that I poured on top. I thin crumbled the lemon cornbread stuff in a bowl and added strawberry onion chicken…PERFECTION. Strawberry shortcake chicken! MMMMMMMM I know it sounds gross but was so good…but not as good as bacon."

0,zarina,52,"Hello all. I’ve been dealing with this problem for more than 6 months–it was caused by weeks of different types of antibiotics. I wrote a long thing but am not sure if I want to write all that publicly, it feels very personal. Suffice it to say that originally the presence of 2 major infections at the same time caused a lot of cognitive problems for about a month when this first started that really took a toll on my life, that I am lucky I made it through it.I’m dealing with vag. yeast infection, oral thrush, occasional intertrigo and intermittent athlete’s foot, and I did have a navel infection but that is gone for the moment.There is weird excessive mucus/saliva immediately after I eat. I have to keep spitting it out. I guess this is part of the oral thrush, I don’t know. There is also excessive mucus if I cry. That never happened, until I got this yeast problem. Now, if I start crying, there is so much mucus I have to just keep blowing my nose for a while, it’s a real drag. If I stop crying it goes away.Also have been dealing with bouts of feeling very cold, usually at night. My body temp. has always been low (96.3-97.5) since I was a kid. I am wondering if it’s something about yeast or thyroid, or both, who knows. Also, sometimes there is weird sweating, when it’s not hot and I’m not exercising or being physically active. I’ve been tested and am not diabetic.I have been under high stress for a couple of years now. I have been depressive/anxious, although it has gotten somewhat better. I am not sure if this was caused by yeast or by other things. It could be a combination of factors. Regulating my emotional environment remains a major challenge on a daily basis. I find that meditation, exercise, being in the sun with skin exposed, and being in nature help regulate my mood.Have been treating the v. yeast infection every day for the past 5 mos, tried various treatments, both prescription and natural, that have not cured it, including boric acid, which is supposed to be a godsend but did not cure it. tried miconozole (for many months), miconozole + tea tree oil mix, tea tree by itself, diluted tea tree oil (for intert. and navel) and now trying terconozole. tried diflucan with some of these, maybe helped but didn’t cure it. I think these “it’ll be gone in 1 week if you take X” things are not really likely anymore. Am starting salt rinses for the oral thrush, hopefully will get some nystatin or something to help it.Today had a weird almost instant intertrigo flare-up because of some hidden sugar I didn’t realize I was consuming. Also I felt very intoxicated after that, which seems to confirm the hypothesis of yeast.I am following pretty much every protocol listed on any yeast site.I tried probiotics but honestly could not tell they were doing anything, and they were quality probiotics that were refrigerated and from a trustworthy source. I also tried them as suppositories, which didn’t do anything. My guess is that I still need to go through the “killing yeast” phase then later do probiotics, I don’t know. They are pretty expensive, to not be able to tell they are working. Also I am lactose-intolerant and avoid all dairy in general because it doesn’t agree with my body, which means I can’t eat yogurt at all, there is no food I can eat that has probiotics in it, and that I can only get the kinds that don’t have a bunch of milk in there. I can’t make the sauerkraut in my kitchen because stuff sort of ferments in there anyway due to the climate, and I don’t think it’s a safe type of bacteria that would result. So… this is kind of a problem since I can’t eat dairy. I am also confused by the conflicting information on the sites about fermented foods. Many sites say “yes! eat all the fermented foods you can get!” Then other sites say, “no! don’t eat any fermented foods, it will feed yeast because you don’t know their practices!” So… I still don’t know if I should be eating any fermented foods. I have been avoiding all fermented foods for the most part due to this issue.I have changed my food and quit many foods, but I think I may have to reduce carbs more. It irks me because my diet is already ridiculously strict for this anti-yeast thing, I have lost 71 lbs in the past 6 mos. I hate to lose even more foods that I can eat. I’m kind of worried about eventually becoming extremely skinny due to not being able to get enough calories from eating like this. That’s probably not a concern for another year or so, but if I keep losing weight at this rate I will run out of fat to lose. But it has been easy for me to lose weight, as long as I keep to the avoided food list.So… this is getting tiresome. I was healthy before this happened, so that is also a double whammy, it is difficult to go from “always healthy” to “ongoing health issue” literally overnight. I’m tired of dealing with this every day and having these symptoms, it is scary when it flares up because up to this point it has been at a level that was not too awful, but these flare-ups are not pleasant, it makes me worried, what kind of stuff will I have to try to withstand while trying to live my everyday life.And it is just frustrating that I can’t tell people about, there is no one to turn to because this is an embarrassing affliction that I don’t want other people to know that I have. And I don’t really have money to get proper medical care, so I have to just make do with whatever I can afford.Next I am thinking maybe biofilm-killing enzymes + rotated antifungals + some kind of suppositories. It all seems very complicated and daunting… I have no idea if the things I try are going to work or not. It’s pretty much make it up as you go.It’s just tough, because there is no real “medical plan” for how to cure this, it seems like doctors have no clue what’s going on, they don’t even know about the food thing, it’s just whatever people can manage to read on the Internet and try, and so many of the sites are just advertisements selling something, so it’s hard to tell what is reliable and what’s not. It seems very odd to me that there are so many people with this affliction, who are just having to look for stuff randomly online instead of having real medical care… this feels to me like something is definitely broken in the system if there is no real medical care available for this condition (except for very minor infections that easily go away) that so many are suffering from.Anyway, that’s my gripe for the day. Thanks for reading."
0,Sanshou,53,"My journey with Candida started a little over 3 years ago and my first noticeable signs were psoriasis. This persisted another year with no idea what it was while I got worse to the point I got pneumonia, psoriasis, a broken rib from mal-nutrition, fibromyalgia and the list goes one. After I had enough tests and doctors shrugging their shoulders; I started searching in earnest on the net and found information on Candida and the foods to avoid. But a lot of information back then seemed very contradictory so I struggled for some time. So after a lot of self experimentation I eventually found a diet and life style that has been working really well for me over the last year or more. And felt I should share in the hopes it may help someone else avoid some of the mistakes I made.After three years or more I’ve grown tired of cooking, which is why most of my main meals tend to be freezer friendly and made in large batches. Sadly not everything freezes to well but roasts and soup are easy to bang out a months worth in a day or two and always seem to taste good.Breakfast; mostly eggs with salsa “special treat; chirizo or sausage with no sugars”, occasionally oatbran or coconut/almond flour cookies because pancakes take to long “I’ve been known to pour it into pancake shapes then place the backing sheet in the oven” and of course salads with meat and salsa are good for any meal. Eggs are kind of controversial but I’ve never had an issue with them in 3 years, I do get hormone free etc, but non organic because of money.Lunch; chicken and vegetable soup “half the time with bone broth or lentils for extra protein” with the right spices it almost never tastes the same, but I do mix up the meats and vegi’s occasionally for health; for instance I add asparagus for problems urinating or beets for dark pee “liver” etc. I know lentils aren’t on the list but I personally don’t react to them like I do to beans, chicken isn’t organic but I get it from a local butcher shop.Dinner; roasts with vegetables tossed in a dutch oven smothered in gravy to make it freezer friendly, stir-fries “no noodles”, lettuce wraps or chicken/taco salads, etc.Snacks; sun flower seeds or salads twice a day with cilantro, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil, chicken and salsa can be added if you need extra protein. Garlic is a great anti-fungal and cilantro helps the body get rid of heavy metals, which will help with bone broths, etc. Using yogurt or kefir milk you can make probiotic salad dressings, cream cheese “dips, cheese cake, etc”, sour cream or popsicles etc.Treats; once every week or two and are almost always made from scratch to control the sugar content allowing me to binge with less side effects. Treats like homemade yogurt/kefir popsicles “sometimes sweetened with fruit or stevia”, homemade cheese cake, homemade chocolate mints “made mostly from coconut oil”, etc. Or my new favorite a lemon, banana cream pie with a chocolate/cinnamon coconut flour crust, using kefir grains to consume the sugar in the heavy cream and banana’s. And I personally try to time my high sugar days for when I’m active and I load up on homemade probiotics and occasional natural antifungals as well.Probiotics; fermented vegetables, kefir water/milk and yogurt. yogurt and kefir I minimize to once/twice a week, but fermented vegetables I eat as much as I want. When fermenting vegetables it’s often napa cabbage with garlic, red pepper flakes and I tend to add a pinch of brown sugar with a few TSB of kefir water to introduce bacteria that processes/consume sugars as it helps speed up the fermenting process.Anti-fungals used are garlic, coconut oil or ceylon cinnamon sticks which I eat as much as I want and try to sneak in most meals or treats. The others like cinnamon oil and oregano oil are newer to me, so I’m limiting my exposure.Beyond the diet I find it helps to keep active which is in part why I try to get 30 minutes of sunshine every 2-3 days and if I can’t; I use a 10k vitamin D supplement.Not everything on here will work for your diet, but it may give you some ideas to work with. One other thing I’ll add is it’s important to consume the proper amount of salt as it aids in digestion and of course stay well hydrated, as I noticed it is extremely easy to become dehydrated with the illness which causes a lot of problems. If you are drinking tap water you may want to mix it with distilled water and let it air for 8-12 hours to cut down on the chlorine and other chemicals in the water and if you have hard water it will improve the taste greatly and cheaply, I pay a little over $2 a month.And the last little bit of information I have is if you are really bad off like I was, cannabis may help, at the very least it should help you sleep which is essential for proper healing. But if you do partake; use a water pipe to filter the smoke or use tinctures etc.That’s about all I have at the moment, if you have question or something to add feel free."
1,Sanshou,53,"So it’s been a while now and I figured I would do a progress update. My diet is mostly the same however, I’ve added in a lot of normal foods again. And well lets just say I’m getting fat again with all the donuts, pizza and other junk I’ve been eating. There were a couple set backs and I resorted to some oregano and cinnamon oil to knock down the fungal infection that resulted in my fingernails. But overall I have more energy and feel good again.What has changed;My vegetable ferment has expanded and I now add sweet potatoes, broccoli and a few other vegetables. I wanted the potatoes for the bacteria that handles those types of starches so I could eat these foods with less issues and get the little extra energy, an added bonus is uncooked potatoes are high in resistant starches which feed good bacteria. Another prebiotic I’ve added in soaked uncooked oatmeal, soaked in water or milk for 8-12 hours in fridge. And finally I made a sourdough starter to make normal bread, donuts, pancakes etc. As the fermented breads breakdown the grains making them easier to digest and causing a lot less issues then normal breads or grains. Mostly I try to stick with the main diet then add in these less friendly foods in as extra calories when being active, but I do sometimes sub out a meal and it’s normally my soup as it has the most carbs of my traditional candida meals.I also went on terbinafine (lamisil) about 7-8 months back and it helped clear up some of nail fungal issues but didn’t help much with the candida symptoms. The script wasn’t enough to completely kill the fungal infection so I’ve been using herbs like oregano and cinnamon oil with good success to finish the job. A few other herbal concentrates I’ve been trying are basil and a few citrus. I also recently tried a parasite herbal cleanse “wormwood, walnut, clove” which seemed to help clear up a lot of my brain fog issues.So really not much has changed, I still have symptoms, but I’m eating normal foods again a few times a week and still improving and feeling a lot better if not fatter about it all. So my next goal is to add in a few more foods like cooked potatoes, rice and well lots and lots of exercise now that I can eat enough to work out properly.Tip; if you do go back to normal foods, give yourself a few days to digest grains/potatoes before stuffing your face with more. As a lot of issues seem to revolve around poor digestion of grains and starches which feed things like candida if left in the gut, so it’s good to stimulate digestion by increasing salt or other enzymes that aid in digestion, fermented vegetables seem to help eaten right before or after a big meal."
2,Sanshou,53,"Well this may be my final entry as my candida symptoms are nearly gone. Granted I still have a fingernail fungal issue and psoriasis, but everything else is clearing up, even eating things I shouldn’t.A few final words of wisdom;Chew your food, it releases enzymes which help with digestion.Do not over eat, anything, even good things “like coconut oil” over eaten will cause digestion problems. But if you do over eat, load up on the fermented foods or probiotics as they will help with digestion and are more likely to make it to your gut with the diminished stomach acids.Stay active, for me surfing has had one of the greatest effects. Not sure if it’s the sunlight, exercise or fermented bacterial soup we call the ocean, but it helps tremendously.For oral thrush, baking soda is the bomb. I started brushing once a day for a week or two then went to twice a week and it was gone, after years of trying other things.“On the baking soda note, you can make a excellent electrolyte drink if you are sweating a lot on your workouts. With a small amount of molasses, vit C “lemon/orange, etc”, baking soda and cream of tartar for extra potassium and fizz.”And to sink it in, really chew anything that might give you issues like grains or other refined carbs. If you do eat refined carbs try to eat it earlier in the day so you can burn it off more easily. And you may want to cut back on your normal calorie count for the day to stimulate your gut to utilize as much as possible. As anything undigested just feeds things like candida.“On the note of refined carbs, potatoes or rice you can cut down on the starches by allowing them to cool after cooking, which will increase the amount of resistant starches which decreases the starchy/sugar content. But as with all things don’t over do it or it will make things worse as resistant starches help ferment other types of bacteria and yeast in the gut.”Also if you cook from scratch like most of us do, don’t forget the salt it also aids with digestion.Good luck to all and get well soon."
3,Emmap,53,"Thanks Sanshau. I really like your approach. Thanks for sharing your journey. I think it’s unique for all of us, and similar in so many ways. I will come back to your records later when I feel I can introduce foods. I like how you have used this thread as a journal…top idea!"
0,Kvaso16,54,"Hi everyone, I’m brand new to the website and I have been led to believe that I have candida due to some really odd symptoms. I have extremely bad food sensitivities and they have been horrible ever since I was 16 years old. I can’t eat anything without getting a splitting migraine that persists for days, it’s so damn ridiculous. I’m intolerant primarily to gluten, fruit (not as terribly), even a lot of gluten free breads, corn, potatoes, dairy (except eggs), almonds as of recently, many other foods too including stuff like bacon. I’m down to unseasoned rice and meat for all my meals. I have dropped about 40 lbs this year, because I have cut out so many food options. Initially I believed I had celiacs, fructose malabsorption, or parasites. But honestly I don’t ever feel much abdominal pain, or diarrhea. I mostly get constipated and I get bloated when I eat something I can’t tolerate too well. Besides most of the conditions I believed I had with the exception of parasites presented very isolated forms of intolerance to certain foods; not as wide range as my symptoms. I also have many other symptoms that has led me to believe I have candida, including the fact that I have battled dry skin for years! It has improved since I’ve improved my diet but I remember one instance when I was 16 years old and my face was crusted from how dry my skin was; I also had a bad itchy rash when I was like 10 on my scrotum. I also even have some dry skin near my genitalia still, not severe though. Anyhow someone please help? Do y’all think I have candida? I’m out of possible explanations? Furthermore, what can I eat if I do have this? I don’t want to drop anymore weight, I’m already at 145 and I’m 6’0 tall. Also recently I have been detoxing with a powerful parasite cleanser, which has anticandida properties, along with diatomaceous earth and a colon cleanser. Since doing this my energy has improved and I’m on week 2 currently. Still though I would like to eat some foods! I’m starving, and I don’t want anymore splitting migraines. Anyone know of the most conservative candida diets? I have seen a lot online and they’re very contradicting, for example some recipes will include fruit, bacon and almonds. I was led to believe that this was bad, so what gives? Well thanks in advance, please I encourage a lot of commenting! I’ve been in dire straits, I’m severely depressed since restricting my diet so heavily. Thanks in advance."
1,JM1985,54,"Hi, I have had the same sympthoms, maybe not so bad. I was intolerant to most dairies and to fruits and vegatables. It took me also long to find out that it is candida, but from there it was much easier. When you actually know what you face with it, there are tons of possibilities. First, I’ve changed my diet completely. I became vegan. It is something trendy to do anyway, so it was not that diffcult. The other important thing is the inner cleansing. My doctor suggested colonix, but I could not do that. I started to search for alternatives and found these tablets: Naturalmax Enerix & Vitalix. It is a complete colon cleanse and detoxifying program, and very good. After taking these for a few weeks, some of my problems disappeared, and I had much more energy. No wonder, as my candida level decreased by 30%. So don’t worry, there is a way out…"

Probiotics are essentially a fungus (good fungus) but the grapefruit seed extract and biofilm will still target these even if they are healthy bacteria’s. Once I have kill the candida then I can begin to restore my gut again with probiotics.Exercise every day. Whether that is walking for 30mins, yogo, swimming etc. Low impact because I’m not in the healthiest state.I just started this program a few days ago so it’s early days but I will definitely update this blog. I feel like it is so important to feel like you can relate to someone going through the same things. I’ve been sick for about three years. I’ve seen GPs, alternative GPs, naturopaths, Chinese doctors etc during this time and spent about $5000 in treatments. It’s been exhausting and depressing. I just don’t feel like myself. After a referral to get a Live Blood Analysis I was diagnosed with SEVERE candida last week. I understand how things can go under the radar and, after 3 years of searching, i’m still skeptical about me having candida. I almost find it difficult to believe that I have FINALLY found what’s wrong with me. My libido has been really difficult to manage mainly because I just don’t feel like me, a sexual woman. I feel like a big part of me is in severe hibernation. Being in a relationship it awful too because sex is so much about chemistry so even with the best party tricks, you can never fake it with someone you love. They always know.I’m very disciplined with what I do and my treatment so it will be interesting to see how this progresses. Everyone is unique therefore everybody’s treatment should be unique. I’ll update in two weeks. If anyone has had experience with candida and their libido please let me know your experience. One of the main symptoms is low libido but there is very little information on this forum and google that talks about peoples experience with it. I’d love it hear.For anyone out there who is suffering from a chronic illness please don’t give up. Keep looking and looking and trying and trying. Our health is so important, don’t settle for being sick."

0,ajc,56,"I’ve just started an allergy elimination and rotation diet as the first phase of my Candida treatment. I was officially diagnosed with Candida based on an IgG blood test a couple of weeks ago by my naturopath. But this isn’t the first time I think I’ve had it; I self-treated multiple GI problems with an elimination diet almost 8 years ago and got to a point of optimal health on a diet consisting of mostly meat and vegetables, the majority raw, and almost all of my food sourced from local farms. But circumstances in my life made it hard to continue this diet after about 3 years into it, and I gradually went back to eating whatever was available. Things have flared up again now for the past few months, and I went to the naturopath for testing this time so I could be more focused in my approach.She does IgG testing for food sensitivities, and there were multiple. As well as the Candida. She recommends a treatment program for Candida which requires taking 3 pills 3 times a day on an empty stomach, but I cannot take pills on an empty stomach, and often not even on a full one. She said I’m probably just not ready yet, but to go ahead and start the diet, to include avoiding foods that support Candida and the foods I tested sensitive too, as well as a rotation diet to avoid becoming sensitive to others. So I’m about a week into my diet now, haven’t started any other Candida treatment, and am also starting treatment for low vitamin D, low ferritin, an MTHFR mutation, and low cortisol, and I am awaiting testing for heavy metals.This has been a hard week! First, because I was drinking way too much coffee (and coffee is one of the foods to which I had IgG antibodies/sensitivities). I didn’t like the coffee before; it tasted bad and felt bad in my body, but it feels good in my mind. Both in terms of alertness and also not having headaches. Headaches were really bad on the first few days of the elimination diet, and I have cheated on my diet and had a cup of coffee about 1/3 of the days. So I’m not sure I’m ready to stay away from it yet.Another challenge is the offers of free food. At work the other day, someone brought us pizza for lunch. I sat alone in my office and ate the buckwheat and broccoli and goat cheese casserole I’d made. And then a neighbor offered me blueberry biscuits she’d just made. I managed to avoid them at first, and hated doing so because I love gift of food, but as hunger struck later, I found myself gobbling a couple of them down.I am realizing that I seem t have a chronic low level nausea that I was managing with foods like biscuits or toast. It seems that that type of carb keeps the nausea in check. And when I feel this nausea, eating fruit or veggies makes me feel sicker. And I don’t feel like preparing something, and wish I just had something instant to grab.I am also realizing how little I want to spend my time preparing food. I like going out and I like having foods ready to go. Planning ahead to cook helps, but how far can you plan ahead and still have fresh, tasty food? Not very… I am spending way more time in the kitchen than I want to be, making myself these foods.Well, that’s my little rant of all the things that are bothering me at the beginning of this path to reach health again. Of course, there are plenty of things going right, like some of the amazingly yummy meals I have created over the past few days — like the eggplant and cherry tomatoes sautéed in eggplant oil with Whole Foods deli’s naked turkey breast and cayenne pepper. That was almost worth it all 🙂 There is much to be thankful for, and I haven’t lost sight of that, but the hard stuff is still hard!"
0,danany,57,"I was informed about a new drug on the market Cervugid Ovules, doctor rather defined as a new concept.! the great advantage that it works on the whole pathological genital flora from Candida albicans, including to HPV! I have no problem out of the genital area, but I know that many diseases, infections, STDs clinically unapparent works at least for a while so I’d like to follow a course of 2-3 boxes Cervugid with 7days break for safety and peace my! Now I know I would urge everyone to go to a gynecological but my belief is that we are daily exposed to an infection with at least candida..asa that no matter how diligently we present we can not at least monthly to the gynecologist !!"
0,smurfie,58,"So I guess I’m another victim of MercuryI got my test results back yesterday. I did a hair mineral analysis. And it shows I have too much mercury, and too much copper. All my vitamin/mineral levels are also really low especially my magnesium levels.At least I know what to work with now. I am however a bit skeptical about the woman I have been going to, because I have bad experience from before where a woman put me on too much stuff and being sensitive like I am I blew up like a balloon and out of nowhere she gave up on me while I was at my worst.So I am feeling some vibes that she really doesn’t get that I’m a sensitive person to A LOT of things, she clearly says she has more experience than me, but I know my body and I have been dealing with this for 8 years! And she wants to put me on a bunch of stuff right away for 4 months, which does not fit my schedule right now at all, cause I know I would be really sick from that. After this 4 months she wants me to do another super expensive test, which I think is ridiculous as it probably is gonna take a long time before my levels are good. As least if I don’t want to kill myself in the process.I got the papers and what she wants me to take (which is specific brands containing stuff I can’t have) and she doesn’t want me to take other brands, because she says «its all chemic» and how much magnesium you have have to relate to how much calcium you have. and stuff like that. But I don’t know if I should believe it is AS complicated as she says. I know I need more magnesium than calcium but I’m sure I can find another supplement that doesn’t make me sick. I honestly think she is trying to make as much money from me as possible my keeping me there, and selling me products and tests, but I know it’s gonna drive me sick, and stop me from doing other important stuff I need to do. I will put time aside for my health but I can’t do it right at this moment, and I need to do it at MY paste and my therms. I have just learned that along the way.So in addition to slowly starting to take the supplements she told me to, I will also get a juicer and eventually start vegetable juicing and stuff like that. Trying to get as much nutrition and detox the bad stuff. I am thinking I will probably go a year living as healthy as I possibly can before I get tested again. I know this is not an easy road, but I just think doing it on my own might be the safer way, and if I feel like it I will ask for help, but right now I am just seeing red flags when it comes to that lady :/I might change my mind though, who knows."

2,Rabelais,58," Contrary to what some forums want us to believe, mercury is not a problem for the vast majority of people.Of course I’m not talking about people in some third-world countries, or those who have been working in the mining industry in the 1950’s. These poor souls actually may suffer from mercury toxicity.Ordinary people hardly ever suffer from mercury. Mercury levels are simply far too low to be a problem. The occasional fish-lover who eats lots of fish from polluted oceans might have a tiny chance of having accumulated too much mercury. But even dentists who work with amalgams during an entire career hardly have any problems at all.Specifically, amalgam fillings have no measurable effect on the amount of mercury in the body. This has been proven by biopsies of all major organs, including the brains, of deceased people (who, of course, gave permission for this before they died). These are the most accurate measurements of mercury levels that are possible – yet even these measurements showed no effect of the number of amalgam fillings or the number of years these fillings have been present, and mercury levels in the body’s organs.This is the very reason why dentists don’t normally engage in removing amalgam fillings. Every needless action on a tooth necessarily causes some additional damage to the tooth. Therefore, removing an otherwise fully functioning amalgam filling is against a dentist’s moral conviction. It’s a practice that’s only being performed by those who value their own wallet higher than their patient’s health.Now removing an amalgam filling before it has reached the end of its lifespan is one thing – that will “only” cause some additional damage to the affected tooth and it will empty your wallet by a discernible amount – but the victims of the mercury scare all too often proceed with highly controversial practices like chelation. Now that’s something that has a real potential to damage your health long-term!Please look for the real cause of any complaints you may have.

3,smurfie,58,"Thanks for your input. I think I will take my test results to the practitioner I used to use and see what she has to say about it. There is no need for me to stress over this as much as I do if it’s only gonna cause me head stress and prevent me from doing my best in my studies.As for what she wanted me to take.A lot of Magnesium and just a bit of Calcium (the one she said I has to take contained fructose and lactose, which I feel is extremely unnecessary)Omega3, Spirlina, B vitamins and Enzymes… that is what she told me.The magnesium part I do think I lack, and some of these things I will try to incorporate eventually to see how I feel (just not the kind she told me to have)Green algae I have also heard somewhere will feed the candida? I have heard that is both good and bad so I’m not quite sure. "
4,AngelaL,58,Thanks for the clarification. I’ve had mercury amalgam fillings for over 30 years but not noticed any ill effects at all – I only began to experience candida problems about 10 years ago after being treated by powerful antibiotics.  I am a little wary about the whole mercury issue – for one thing the cost of removing all my amalgam fillings in the Uk would amount to thousands of pounds so it’s not a route I could even consider.  I’ve noticed that people usually have been diagnosed with mercury problems and go off in another direction hoping for a cure – but I haven’t seen much from people who having undergone the whole expensive treatment have actually experienced a great deal of relief in their symptoms so I remain unconvinced ….
5,smurfie,58,"Yes I believe antibiotics is what did it for me too. But I don’t think there is any amount of probiotics alone that will fix the problem, so there has to be something else. But I have also heard (in case mercury fillings are bad) that if you get them removed, it will actually release much more toxins to your body. I don’t have those fillings myself, but I eat a lot of fish from the north sea. I mentioned this to the practitioner and she said it’s not really a big deal, as the mercury levels are pretty low and it’s my low vitamin levels that really is the problem why my body is so out of balance (which allow the mercury levels to be high)If the my results are true my body does seem very out of balance, which I’m not surprised about cause I feel so exhausted all the time! My diet has been so limited for so long and lately I haven’t been taking a lot of vitamins either. I recently just started taking iron, vitamin D milk thistle along with probiotics and olive leaf extract (this was before I took the test). I find it hard to start new pills because my body seem to freak out. I can get swellings or an upset stomach which sometimes result in cellulites which I got a huge complex about cause I feel it’s just taking over completely.And mood swings, that I get too.I want to try and stay positive and get better, I just hate this process."
0,Yuki,59,"I posted here about a year or so ago at a much earlier point in my Candida Journey. Since then, I have come a long way. After just a few week shorts on the diet and feeling like crap, I “relapsed” into my old American diet, and I stayed that way for nearly a year. I was okay…at first. As you may have guessed, about four months ago Candida returned with a vengeance, and here I am.I started back at square one, but as usual with me, I rushed into it far too quickly. I wasn’t playing around this time, so I loaded up on as many antifungals as possible. One of those was called “chlorella.” Golly gee did I make a big mistake! I stuck strictly to the diet but over the course of a month my symptoms and die off only worsened. Die off included everything from daily headaches and brain fog to oral thrush and a yellow tinted tongue. My night sweats worsened, and I was having heart palpitations so severe that, quite frankly, I was becoming afraid.I was already taking supplements for my liver, so I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong…until it dawned on me: mercury. It was only something I’d read about in passing around here and other forms, something I never paid much attention because hey–I hadn’t had any amalgam in my mouth since I was a child! (Or, so I thought.)After eleven fillings, four root canals, gum surgery, and severe bone loss in my jaw, it turns out two of my old fillings DO have metal underneath! Porcelain over metal posts, yippee. On top of the <span style=”line-height: 1.5;”>chlorella, I eat lots of cilantro as part of my regular diet (I make my own salsa and put it in salads) so as it turns out, I was unknowingly chelating a bunch of mercury and dumping it into my bloodstream! Well, that explains a lot.</span>My symptoms promoted a visit to my PCP, who drew blood and took a swab of my mouth. Turns out I’m not quite hyperthyroid but I was well on my way. My sympathetic nervous system is a train wreck, and the stress caused a rise in my cholesterol. Here I am, $9,000 in debt later, still bed ridden, candida ridden, and apparently, poisoned by mercury. The test is still pending but now that my doctor and dentist are in communication, they both believe the amalgam to be the cause.Thankfully, my current dentist doesn’t use amalgam, and once my insurance is switched in 2-3 months, I should be able to afford having the crowns removed and remade–porcelain only. My old crowns were so poorly constructed they also caused permanent damage to my bite as well.Yup! So at last, I at least feel like I have found the “cause” of this horribleness. A few months ago I was certain I was hyperthyroid, that my immune system was irreparably damaged, and that I’d have to live with candida for the rest of my life! In combination with my PCP and Dentist, we are working on mapping out a care plan for the next two years.First step, removing and replacing my crowns. In the meantime, I have been supplementing with probiotics, a mixed mineral supplement, activated charcoal, molybdenum, and high doses of vitamins D, E, and C. I am also taking fish oil and flaxseed oil daily. I also drink detox, echinacea, and nettle leaf tea to help with die-off. Of course, these supplements are all in addition to sticking to the strict candida diet protocol. I also take one detox Epsom salt bath once per week, as well as a clay detox.So far, improvement has come in short bursts. My remaining symptoms are: yellow tinted tongue, headaches, vision loss/blurriness (especially in my right eye where the worst crown is), tooth pain, trembling hands, insomnia, and fatigue. My vaginal yeast infections seem to have largely cleared up, and my despite the very thin film on my tongue, I tested negative for Candida in my mouth. Even better, the night sweats have disappeared and I can almost think!The next 2-3 months will be spent building up my immune system while the crowns are removed, and I will began mercury chelation not long after. I am very nervous so I will be starting on the lowest dose of DMPS. I’ll be starting at 5mg and working up to 25mg over the course of about six months. Depending on improvement, I may begin adding low doses of ALA (Alpha Lipolic Acid) around that time as well.I know I’m still a long ways off, but I’m hoping that 2-3 years from now, this will all be behind me. I was depressed for a while, and though I still struggle with it I am feeling a lot more positive. I hope to be healthy enough in a few years to be able to carry a child without any complications. I will be posting routine updates here about my progress, both with the the diet and chelation. I hope someone can gain something from reading my experience.-YukiDonate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)"
1,Yuki,59,"Unfortunately, this month has been full of “cheating.” My brother in law was just married, and although I tried to stick to the diet as much as possible (we even brought our own food–but not nearly enough) we could only do so much. I figured my brother only gets married once, so I let loose. I drank alcohol, had a few small desserts, and even a quarter of a potato. The food was pretty subpar…so I’m not sure how worth it it was, lol.Since then, my fiance and I filled out our marriage licence, and in celebration went out to dinner. I ate a baked potato, and we split a small dessert.It only gets worse…this weekend we’ll be at a convention out of state from Thursday-Sunday, so I can’t imagine we’ll be able to stick entirely to the diet. We plan on bringing as much food as possible (dozen hard boiled eggs, a ton of meatballs, chicken stir fry, beef stir fry, a big old container of zucchini noodles on top of our usual spinach, cucumber, tomatoes, and celery for salads) but whether or not it will last is still up for debate. We plan on ordering breakfast every morning, so…fingers crossed!Still, once we get married on the 24th, her parents are taking us out to eat, and we’re at the very least going to celebrate for our damn marriage! I plan on eating WHATEVER I want (and reaping the consequences the next day.) Even worser, the 26th is my fiance’s birthday, so that’s another night we’ll be eating something off-diet.Blargh! So this month is pretty crap as far as my diet is concerned. Luckily, we plan on recleansing all throughout March, and we follow the diet very strictly. No soy, no sugars, no crabs, etc. etc. The only exceptions for me are Almond Butter (less than 1g of sugar per serving), nuts, and full fat yogurt (a whopping 5g of sugar per serving.) I have to eat these things in order to stabilize my weight (we’ve both been losing weight since beginning, but it’s much more dangerous for me.)So I’m hoping March can be my cleanse month, just in time to up my immune system, shit kick the candida, and be as healthy (as possible) for the removal of my crowns. To be honest, I don’t mind the diet too much, and I find plenty of ways to keep it interesting. I plan on posting some recipes later on today if I have the time.Did I mention for Valentine’s Day I got a bunch of sugar free, low carb treats? Some of the candy contains alcohol based sweeteners (ugh) but I don’t plan in indulging in much of those. From Etsy I found a nice woman who makes her own chocolate from scratch, and made me several homemade truffles, chocolates, and “cookies” all entirely sugar free and as a low as 2 net carbs per serving. I am looking forward to their arrival today, maybe I’ll post pics!-YukiDonate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)"
2,Rabelais,59," Be very, very careful with chelation! It’s a highly controversial practice. It may severely affect your health for years to come.Chelation involves adding lots of unnatural chemicals directly into your bloodstream. This messes up your electrolyte balance and it interferes with the transportation of nourishment to your cells, and with the removal of waste products from the cells to the liver and the kidneys. The body is stressed by having to remove the chelating chemicals which your are constantly adding.Note that chelation is known by medicine. It is used when it is necessary. But, more importantly: it is not used when it is not necessary! This latter thing is for good reason: chelating is helpful when the problems (a real poisoning) are severe enough to outweigh the dangers of chelation, but it is harmful when there is nothing to be treated in the first place. That’s why doctors are quite reluctant when it comes to chelation. It’s simply too risky.Rabelais "
0,Wendy_35,60," Hi all My post is going to be very similar to the others posted recently I guess. I am basically being driven crazy by Candida! A couple of years or so ago, I was having serious dental issues. I was given a succession of anti-biotics and foolishly didn’t back this up with pro-biotics. Which is why I believe I’m in this mess in the first place! Anyway, the worst part is that it was only officially diagnosed a month ago. Before that I had spent the best part of 2 years wondering what the hell was wrong with me! I also wasn’t as aware of Oral thrush/candida as I might have been, which hasn’t helped. It’s taking a massive toll on my mental well-being…as some other posters have said. For the last month I have adhered to the foods you’re supposed to eat, taken the right supplements and pro-biotics. And I don’t feel a lot better really…it’s getting me down very badly indeed. I get the feeling fixing Candida is anything but a quick fix though? Should I just try and be more patient and see where I am a few months down the line with this? Keep thinking there’s something I should be doing, or something I’m doing that I shouldn’t! Any advice / encouragement / reassurance etc etc would be gratefully received!"
1,Maiscout,60,"Don’t worry, it will get better! This may not be what you want to hear but I didn’t notice much improvement for the first 10 weeks or so. I am now around 14 weeks in noticing a difference in my symptoms. What are you doing at the moment in terms of antifungals?"
2,Wendy_35,60,"Hi, Thanks for responding! In terms of antifungals…I’m taking ordinary garlic, Kyolic garlic, Higher Nature Citricidal Grapefruit seed extract, Oregano Oil, and two lots of something called Candiclear that I picked up in health food shops. I’m taking all of this basically at the same time. I am now convincing myself that they are all cancelling eachother out or something, as stupid as that sounds! What helped with you then?"
3,jonjon,60,"Hi Wendy. I think you proabably just have to resign yourself to sticking with it in the longer-term; as well as getting to know your own body, and its specifics. In my case, I think I had candida symptoms since I was a child (30 – odd years ago): most of may family have various fungal/thyroid/digestive issues – so it seems a genetic weakness. I had a poor diet since my early teens, plus a very stressful childhood, etc. By the time I was in my late 30s I was collapsing, barely able to hold down a job, never getting any proper sleep, permanently dizzy and spaced-out with episodes of loss of vision, reacting to all kinds of food, etc. I think (and thought at the time) that I was not too far away from dying – I had virtaully every symptom of bad chronic candida overgrowth. I hit on the idea of candida about 4 or 5 years ago, then it was a learning process – trying to work out how to get in control: as I gained knowledge I have got better at understanding what I can/can’t do. For instance, I worked out that strenous exercise/saunas (internal heat) always makes me feel worse – not sure if it’s ‘die-off’ or just shaking my guts up (I had to give up my manual job). It took me about a year to see any real progress in my health and now (after 4 or 5 years) I’d say I’m maybe 70 percent better. I never feel as horribly toxic and depressed as I used to feel more or less permanently – I barely raised a smile for about ten years. I also think I’ll be on a more or less strict diet for the rest of my life – but actually I like it and have lost the taste for sweet stuff; so that’s fine. I do not drink alcohol, avoid all grains except sometimes buckwheat (easily available here in Ukraine); eat loads of garlic and veg as well as salads, meat, fish, etc., have not eaten any sugar or sweetened stuff for 4 years or so. My only ‘sin’ is about 3 coffees a day, but I seem OK with that; plus I am OK on dairy – not mouldy stuff like aged cheese or cheese with fermenting stuff; more fresh cheeses like cottage cheese; plus loads of live yoghurts. The one thing I just could not manage for a long time was coconut oil – I felt absolutely dreadful after eating it. But I’ve managed to get myself onto a few tablespoons of coconut milk a day (the stuff I use is 17 percent fat – meaning oil). I have noticed that after getting over what I think was ‘die-off’ from coconut oil I’ve started adapting to it and I get the sense it’s doing me a lot of good – the other day no candida showed up in a ‘spit test’ and the eye floaters I’ve had basically forever are disappearing. Do check out coconut oil, the lauric and caprylic acid (in the fat) are supposed to be the stuff that helps. I also eat a lot of turmeric (fresh or powdered), plus other spices of all kinds. Anyway, that’s my story – and I guess my point is that you’ll have to make your own journey; but if I can do it, and others with very bad cases, you can too – you’ll just have to stick at it. I see it as a condition I need to accept, and slowly chip away at."
4,Yuki,60,"What kind of dental work did you have done? I’ve had a ton of dental work done recently and surprisingly enough, this could be related to candida as well! In my case I had two old crowns attached to metal posts.

0,Virrago,61,"I’ve undergone several medical treatments and am currently on a strict no-suggar diet for 3 weeks. It started early June really heavy. My entire throat was sore, red and it hurt all the time, especially swallowing. It took 6 doctors and a month to finally get the diagnosis. Ever since then I have used Nystatin suspension (4 months). Today, it’s the 24th day using Fluconazol, combined with a strict suggar and carbonhydrate diet. The doctor didn’t tell me about that, I had to do my own research. Now, I eat only vegetables, meat and milk products. My throat still throbs slightly and is still as colorful and blistered as it was in June. Tomorrow I’ll see the doctor again. Any advice on what I can do differently? Or how much longer I need to be patient? Or is the diagnosis wrong? (Had 4 swabs of my throat, all were positive on candida :/ ) I’ve also tried a week of pomegrenate and take pomegrenate extract regularly."
1,caterina81,61,"Hiya, There is obviously something in your diet your body doesn’t like and candida loves. It could be anything! Maybe Maltodextrin in something you eat? Its in a lot of processed foods and vitamins (I recently found it in my vitamin C) and candida love it. Milk products? As in cows milk? As they are a no no’s apart from butter. Have you tried drinking cider apple vinegar natural with the mother? It really helped me. Personally I wouldn’t take any anti fungals but that’s just me, others swear by them. I’m not freaked out by yeast any more, Im more freaked out that im that unhealthy! I know in time and it will take time for sure that i will become healthy and the candida will naturally disappear. So many focus on the candida/yeast rather than the root problem and docs certainly don’t help with that! Best wishes"
2,caterina81,61,"A quote from another thread Quote from Dr. Hal Huggins “Strangely enough, Candida is there to save your life. It changes methyl mercury to a less toxic (but still toxic) form. Bacteria change it back to methyl mercury, and the system goes back and forth. If Candida were eliminated while you have amalgam in your mouth, your health will not be as good as if it were there protecting you. Complex, but yes, there is a relationship.” I’m sure candida isn’t just present due to mercury but either way it is present for a reason. It seems like many people on antifungals etc is the same as taking a cast off a broken leg. The cast which shouldn’t normally be there becomes the focus and must be removed. So many of us, including doctors do not understand candida and going the incredible amounts of people saying how they are still suffering years into a candida diet/antifungals, makes me wonder why! I cannot rest until I find the answers to things that just don’t add up.. i’m a little obsessed with researching!"
3,Yuki,61,I was about to ask the same thing. Try looking for the root cause. Candida is often just a “symptom” of a weakened immune system.

A huge part of this lifestyle is learning from others and helping one another towards health. I am currently re-introducing an anti-fungal regimen with SF722 (undecylenic acid) after taking a two week break from anti-fungal/anti-parasite herbs and supplements. Current Symptoms: Small acne breakout on chin area. Occasional itchy armpits. Body odor from armpits. Suspected urinary tract infection. Current Diet/Lifestyle Warm glass of fresh lemon water first thing in the morning. (Sometimes with Ashwagandha tea for adrenal support.) Meals:  5-6 meals per day spaced about 3 hours apart. Consist of roughly 2 cups vegetables, small fist-sized portion of protein, and 1-2 tablespoons of a fat. Last meal about 2 hours before bed. Between meals: Drink about 1/4 cup of homemade cabbage rejuvelac. Bacillus Coagulans probiotic capsule in the morning and at night. Ashwagandha and/or ginger tea before bed. Vegetables: I have been focusing on low-oxalate/low-starch vegetables.  Steamed: Green beans, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, onion, garlic.  Raw: Green leaf lettuce (started 12/6/14) Protein: Wild venison. Antibiotic/hormone free chicken and turkey.  Grass-fed, antibiotic/hormone free beef. Wild caught USA salmon. (Plan to add free-range eggs this week) Fat: Lamb tallow Coconut oil Extra Virgin Olive Oil Ghee Seasonings: Himalayan Salt Supplements: With every meal: 1 Digest Gold enzyme capsule 8 or 9 Betaine HCL w/ Pepsin capsules (I did the betaine challenge test but never reached a max so I have kept it at this dose.) 1 SCD Complete multi-vitamin capsule Once or twice per day with meals: 1 Pantethine capsule (detox support) 1 Molybdenum capsule (detox support) 1 Liver Essence capsule (detox support) Empty stomach: SF722 (Started 12/6/14 with 1 cap/day and will slowly increase dose) (antifungal) 1 Arginine/Ornithine capsule 2-3 times per day. (detox support) 1/2 teaspoon glutamine powder 2-3 times per day. (detox support) Detox Methods: Near-infrared sauna once or twice per day for about 30 mins. Jogging or light workout for about 15 mins. Dry skin brushing before shower/bath. Hydrotherapy in the shower (alternating between hot and cold). Yoga/stretching. Deep breathing practices. Epsom salt baths 1-2 times per week (adding powdered ginger for better detox and Vitamin C to neutralize chlorine). Spraying magnesium oil (dissolved epsom salt in water) on gut/chest/kidneys several times per day. Drinking water only in-between meals to avoid diluting digestive juices. Adequate sleep (7-8 hours). Mental: Focusing on a positive and grateful attitude.  Occasional meditation. 12/7/14: Better sleep.  Acne breakout clearing up. Improvement in energy and attitude. Lessened pain while urinating due to UTI.youarewhatyoudigest.blogspot.com"

0,catlover0329,63,"I’ve been on candida diet for a month and am still having really bad die off in the form of skin rashes and hives and insomnia. I am taking 3000 mg of vitamin C, a multivitamin, echinacea, a garlic and ginger supplement, milk thistle, multiple doses of molybdenum, Spirulina, nettle leaf tea, a strong probiotic, coconut kefir, and of course having no sugar at all. My diet consists primarily of homemade chicken vegetable soup (a little carrot, onion, and garlic) and a plate of leafy salad greens with cultured veggies and EVOO. If I am hungry I have a handful of soaked, dehydrated almonds. I take an oatmeal bath every night with Epsom salt and/or apple cider vinegar, drink lots of water, and have had 6 sessions of colon hydrotherapy and two sessions of infrared sauna. My question is how long has the die off lasted for some of you? I did the spit test this morning and was dismayed to see lots of floatey stringy things in there which tells me I still have a colony of candida in my body. I wonder what it was like when I started? I am going nuts having rashes that itch unbearably and a red face. It seems like it gets better for a little while then all of a sudden (usually at night) I itch so bad I want to die. Any advice would be helpful."
1,raster,63,"The spit test should not be used for diagnosis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6iryzPoBow If you were to sweat out the toxins by doing sauna, steam room, hot tub, jacuzzi, etc. it likely would completely reduce or eliminate die-off. The length of die-off varies person to person. I would be very careful with spirulina and would try time without it. I’ve had problems with it personally. -raster"
2,catlover0329,63,"Thanks, raster! I’m surprised the spit test isn’t valid test for candida since it seems like so many sites including Body Ecology advocate this is a cheap and quick way to test for it. I had no idea. I do have symptoms of candida overgrowth namely in the form of progressively worse food allergies. Started with gluten three years ago and eliminated it and then had to progressively cut out soy, dairy, MSG, all additives, and eat organic – and sometimes I still reacted to foods high in histamine. I have leaky gut and probably it resulted from multiple rounds of steriod creams and antibiotics plus from being on the Pill for years. I am seeing a doctor in December (one who leans toward holistic therapy) so I am hoping she can help me confirm it and make sure I am on the right track. I am curious about what didn’t work for you for spirulina. It seems to cause bad die off reactions in me when I take just one but I am not sure if that is the cause – so I am careful to take it as little as possible. I am also starting on a different antifungal tomorrow called Nutracraft Parasite Clear in case I have a parasite in my gut. For probiotics I currently take Threelac powder once per day and Jo-Mar Labs Pure Form 21 Blend amino acids to assist in digestion. I read some bad things about Threelac so am switching to Maxi 7 million Supreme Advanced Multi Probiotic capsules when they arrive from Amazon. I’m also starting Jarrow Formulas L-Arginine amino acid to support my immune system and detox my liver. I wish I had access to a steam room, sauna or hot tub. Infrared sauna costs $20 per session and I am going broke with all of the supplements I am buying. Did I mention the bentonite clay I got too? I figure something has got to help. I am gonna look for a sauna or hot tub to detox the die off. I think I get to use the pool and attached hot tub at a hotel near me for free as a result of my gym membership. Thanks for the help!"
3,raster,63,"If you want diagnosis, I would check out the candia5 test which is pretty cheap. Spirulina gave me the runs and I had bad reactions to it. Threelac is pretty weak and there are other probiotics that contain those strains in higher quantities. One is a thorne product (bacillus coagulans) and then garden of life contains the other 2 strains. -raster"
0,Gizmo,64,"I’ve had what I assume is Candida for I’m guessing about 2 years. I didn’t really have any symptoms other than a general feeling of “crapness” and some brain fog / dizzyness until about a year ago. The first symptom of something being really odd was severe hangovers from small amounts of alcohol — like a 2-3 day hangover from 3 pints. Which for me is just not right. This was put down to gastritis by the doctor, numerous blood tests showed nothing unusual, and I was given PPI stomach acid blockers. I took these PPI’s for a few months on and off, but they seemed to make no difference at all, I felt no improvement in my stomach. Eventually I ended up with quite bad acid reflux which stopped me being able to sleep as I’d wake up with a burning sensation and bad nausea which I had to sit upright to get rid of. A lot of Googling later lead me acid supplements rather than blockers, as I’d read that both low and high stomach acidity can cause acid reflux. I started taking apple cider vinegar with food, and magically (literally over night) the reflux was gone. I moved on to HCL supplements rather than the vinegar and was generally improving for quite some time up until I was feeling pretty normal. Previously I was having difficulty even telling if I was hungry as my stomach just never felt right. Annoyingly at this point I ended up having an endoscopy which had been booked some time before, which, as you’d expect, showed nothing. At this point I had a wisdom tooth infection and had some antibiotics to clear it, and about a week after finishing the antibiotics everything seemed to come back again and generally from this point got worse and worse. It got to the point I couldn’t really eat as food just sat in my stomach literally all day, I had no apatite and lost about a stone in weight. I found taking acid supplements at this point seemed to do pretty much nothing — I could take them until the bottom of my esophagus would actually hurt due to the acid levels when I swallowed and as it opened, but I could feel nothing in my stomach at all. By random luck really I ended up being in this situation of very high stomach acid and driving somewhere with no water on me, so it ended up I held this very strong acid in my stomach for about 30 minutes or more and I found eventually I could feel some warmth in my stomach. So I tried this again a few times and eventually I assume it burned the candida from my stomach lining and returned my stomach to producing acid again. This gave me a very sore stomach, but also a fair fever for a couple of days as everything in my stomach was killed off. After that I felt better in many ways, but still quite unwell. At this point I found out about resistant starch and started experimenting with that. This seemed to be the final thing that I needed to sort myself out and I was pretty much cured for a couple of months. No burping (which I seemed to get about every 10 minutes), no brain fog, good appetite, but a sore stomach. I changed doctors (I had been many times during this whole time, being completely ignored every time) and had a chat with the new one. I decided to try some renitidine to sort the soreness in my stomach. This was a bad move I think in retrospect. A few weeks ago its all come back again, so I’m now at the stage of trying to increase stomach acidity and kill off the crap in my stomach again, although as ever things are behaving differently. No matter what acid supplements I take, I basically feel no warmth in my stomach and no burning at the bottom of my esophagus, which leads me to believe this stuff is neutralising the acid as quickly as I can add it. I’ve no idea if anyone else has had any experience like this, but it really is killing me, mentally and physically."
1,caterina81,64,"Hiya, How is your sea salt intake? I’ve been added salt to every meal to help increase my stomach acid. In the programme I am following you are meant to have a teaspoon of cracked sea salt a day. I try to find the best brand that doesn’t add anything or take anything away. Also hows is you fat intake? Ive had to also up mine majorly (good fats virgin coconut oil and organic butter). Best wishes Cat"
2,Gizmo,64,"I certainly think in the case of fungal overgrowth in the stomach, which I’m pretty sure is what I have (I cant explain all the symptoms in any other way!), the more stomach acid you can create the better. I have tried things like Swedish bitters and bitter melon supplements as both of these promote digestion. Although I think the point I took these my stomach was pretty much unable to produce acid I think. I don’t know if my stomach is so covered in this fungus that it stops acid production entirely, or if just there is enough there that the process of it metabolising is neutralising all the stomach acid. But for me acid supplements were the only way to get some more acid into my system. I’ve tried coconut oil, but one thing to be wary of with oils is that they require quite a lot of acid to digest, so it does knock your acid levels. If you’re already swamped with candida this may not be helpful (lots of fat seems to make things worse for me). I’m trying xylitol and have some anti-fungal stuff (Fluconazole) from the doctor, so I’ll see how that goes. This has been going on so long I’ll be amazed if it helps, but hopeful none-the-less."
3,Rabelais,64,"  I’m confused… You are basically stating that it’s good to increase acidity when fighting candida. Yet, today, Janek testified that he destroyed his candida by decreasing acidity… It’s really confusing… Rabelais  "
4,Gizmo,64,"Candida thrives in an alkaline environment, so I really don’t understand this. It will depend on where the candida is of course. In my case my main issue seems to be candida in my stomach, which I think is a bit unusual, normally it’s the small intestine as this has a naturally low acidity (around ph 6 I think). Normally the acidity of the stomach acid kills candida, but in my case I think I must have low stomach acid, either through lifestyle, stress (which can both increase stomach acid levels so I read) or just some heredatory condition. However one thing I remember reading basically said if the stomach acidity drops, the acidity of the small intestine is increased to compensate. So this may be the logic behind reducing stomach acid — however candida can multiply down to about ph 2, which is pretty acidic. However after being on PPI’s which stop stomach acid production completely, I believe this helped candida get a hold in my stomach and certainly didn’t seem to help me. I guess every case and indeed person is different in what works for them. At the moment I’ve been re-reading about probiotics as resistant starch has been the most helpful thing I’ve found so far, however it does feed candida as well, so you have to be careful to get it right. I realised I was taking way to low a dose of probiotics before (10cfu per day) where I read it should be more like 200cfu. Just tonight I’ve tried taking about 150cfu and the results have been very good so far, so this is my latest favourite. If I can get things under control a bit more I will try re-adding resistant starch to my diet again to really outnumber the candida with bacteria. Considering how many people there are out there suffering with this, it amazes me doctors still say they don’t believe it exists unless you are immune suppressed. The lack of support from modern medicine is just astounding and massively depressing."
5,Gizmo,64,"I’ve had some more thoughts in baking soda… NaHCO3 + HCL = NaCL + H2O + CO2 Is the reaction you get when you adding baking soda to hydrochloric acid. The interesting part of the output there is NaCL, or salt. Sodium chloride is an anti fungal, so I’m wondring if this created in the stomach was beneficial? Also, the other poster mentions drinking cider apple vinegar, this is quite acidic and something I use myself to acidify my stomach. So there are a few things going on there, making the stomach less acidic may not be the key. In fact stomach acid levels will return quite quickly assuming your body is working well. I must admit the amount of conflicting information out there really does make it difficult to know what on earth to try, but I think the key is to just experiment and figure out what works for you…"
6,jameskep,64,Fungal candida thrives in a more alkaline environment. Candida in its yeast form is more suited for an acidic environment. When candida gets out of control(over-populated without good bacteria to keep it in check) it morphs back and forth and adapts to the PH conditions. The optimal conditions for your good bacteria(mostly in your colon) is slightly acidic..hence the term “acid”dophilus. Its not a good idea to be too acidic or too alkaline. Over alkalizing can cause ingestion/constipation or can buffer to much of the beneficial digestive acids. Being over acidic can lead to inflammation. It depends on the acid chemical/metabolite as some can cause more inflammation than others.
7,Gizmo,64,"Very interesting, thanks! I’ll have to do some more reading on the different states of candida. I was certainly aware of the different states, but not what conditions they thrive in. Also, the higher dose probiotics seem to have helped massively. I’ve just had the best nights sleep possibly ever."
8,Gizmo,64,"Actually thinking about it, as candida metabolises it turns its environment more alkaline and then converts to its hyphal fungal state. So all you’re doing by decreasing acid is making it easier for the yeast to convert to its fungal state, which is the evil stuff you want to get rid of. So I’m still baffled by the reducing acidity idea."
9,Rabelais,64,"  I was just as baffled by the fact that two contradicting views appeared on this forum almost simultaneously. One view advised to increase acidity, while the other view advised to decrease acidity. The proponents of each of these views backed their advice by personal experience. I found this contradiction worth pointing out. I have no opinion of myself. That’s because I know that a healthy body regulates its own acidity. Therefore, it is not possible to change the acidity of the blood, the organs, or any other tissues. It’s even not possible to speak of “the acidity” of a tissue. That’s because inter-cellular fluids and intra-cellular fluids all have their own specific acidity level. Acidity level even varies from one cell type to another. Rabelais  "
10,Gizmo,64,"We are talking about the acidity of the contents of an organ here, however. This is very easily changed. The presence of multiplying yeast will rapidly decrease acidity, the addition of acid will increase it. The whole issue here however is people with a Candida overgrowth are by definition, not healthy, and regulating stomach acid etc becomes an issue due to an outside force. One thing I can say so far is that strong probiotics seem good. Not sure if they’re decreasing my symptoms yet, but its certainly giving some good die off dizzyness etc. Could be useful to use these to weaken the fungus and then attack it with more acid. We’ll see in the coming days…. more acid on order."
11,raster,64,"What most people should be doing is increasing acidity of digestive tract while increasing alkalinity in their body just to clarify… If acidic body pH cured candida, then almost all of us would be cured of it before we even started the diet. No one really tests their pH but it should ideally be close to neutral. -raster"
12,Rabelais,64," Gizmo;60543 wrote: We are talking about the acidity of the contents of an organ here, however. This is very easily changed. The presence of multiplying yeast will rapidly decrease acidity, the addition of acid will increase it. What do you mean when you speak about “the contents of an organ”? The acidity of “the contents of” the liver is very, very constant. The acidity of “the contents of” the heart is very, very constant too. So is the acidity of “the contents of” the brain. I’m putting “the contents of” between quotation marks here. This is because the acidity of various liver cells (to give just one example) will be different, depending on the kind of liver cell. The fluid between the liver cells will have its own acidity as well. Therefore, there simply is no such thing as “the acidity” of the liver. The liver has many acidities. All of those acidities are regulated to remain in very, very narrow ranges.    raster;60544 wrote: What most people should be doing is increasing acidity of digestive tract while increasing alkalinity in their body just to clarify… Again, there’s no such thing as “the acidity” (or: “the alkalinity”) of the body. Each type of cell has its own specific acidity level. The acidity of the digestive tract can vary, but only by a bit. Any small changes in digestive-tract acidity are compensated as soon as nutrients enter the bloodstream. Rabelais  "
13,Gizmo,64,"I thought I’d report I’ve been having good results using tumeric. I’ve read a lot of people have found it very good as well. I’ve been using : 1 tsp tumeric 1/4 tsp cinamon 1/4 tsp ground black pepper 1/4 tsp cayene pepper 1g vitamin c tablet powdered All mixed in a glass and dissolved in water. I’ve read black pepper and vitamin c both increase the “bio availability” of the active compound in tumeric which is an antifungal. I’ve also read lots of medical investigations into the use of the active agent in tumeric as an antifungal as there are fungal strains resistant to nystatin and fluconazole. So there does indeed seem to be scientific rather than just anecdotal evidence to back this up. I tried this mix every 2 hours on Sunday and got die off symptoms all day. It seems to kick in about 45 minutes after taking it. I reduced the dose a bit on Monday as I felt totally crap, but by the end of the day I started feeling much better. I then slept better as well, so I’ve upped the dose again and am getting less die-off and am generally feeling better. So hopefully onto a winner here. Will report back again. Oh, and I finish the day with 100 billion CFU probiotics and 3x “Probiotic 3” SBO probiotic. I had very good results with strong probiotics a couple of weeks back, but their effectiveness wore off quite quickly. And of course keep on with acid supplements with meals too."
14,Gizmo,64,"Rabelais;60547 wrote:  What do you mean when you speak about “the contents of an organ”? The acidity of “the contents of” the liver is very, very constant. My issue is candida in my stomach. You can very easily control the acidity of the stomach. Drink vinegar, for example, or take acid supplements to increase acidity, or if you wish to decrease acidity drink lots of water or take ant-acid medication either in the form of chalk (renne’s etc) or inhibitors like renitidine etc. I agree past the stomach you cant do much. The pancreas releases an ant-acid substance as food goes into the small intestine to correct the PH for this part of the digestive tract. The keys to get shot of a fungal infection are to make the environment as inhospitable as you can. So use antifungals and whatever other means you can to starve and kill the fungus. I have some kefir seeds coming soon, so I’m hopeful that will also be good in upping my good bacteria levels."
0,Camjrcole,65,"Hello, I have had an enormous list of candida symptoms for 8 years with all tests reporting back fine. Maybe it’s MS, cleared MRI and cat scans (4 in the last 8 years). Exploratory inner ear surgery, negative. ENT says all is fine. Despite a list of 15 plus symptoms, they all basically say it is stress, depression getting older (I’m 32) hormones, blah blah blah. I started the strict candida diet 3 days ago, today I woke up with flu like symptoms, headache, foggy brain, nausea etc. (felt great for the first 2 days) these are basically my normal symptoms including ear popping, severe vertigo and reflux(reflux and burning mouth has actually gotten better in just 3 days). My other symptom today is a very bad red rash all over both of my cheeks. It is host to touch and a bit sore and almost burns when I touch it. Is it too soon to experience these die off symptoms? I really didn’t expect this so quickly. Considering I have had this severely for 8 years with no help or even a smidgen of a clue to being completely infested, I want to say that it is all die off related but it seems too soon?"
1,raster,65,"Die-off can happen after one day on the diet. If you want diagnosis I would check out the candia5 test. The inner ear problem is caused by bacteria, not yeast and you can reverse it with drops of hydrogen peroxide and a combination of kosher salt and distilled water in the nasal passages (nasal rinse). -raster"
2,tofu,65,"Hi Raster, I’ve been on the diet, antifungals and probiotics for 2 months now (following Lisa Richards book very carefully)… Is it normal to still have die off !!?? I don’t have severe episodes but they are frequent enough to pull me down… Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing something here 😮 ??"
3,raster,65,I’ve had some members have die-off that lasts for 6+ months. Typically die-off is related to liver health so something is going on with your liver. The one person who had it for 6+ months ended up having mercury toxicity. Are you detoxing the toxins? This should prevent die-off. -raster
0,[email protected],66,"I’m so happy I just had to share it with others who will appreciate it. After a round of antibiotics a couple years ago for a lung infection, I’ve had recurring yeast problems, usually in the form of vaginal infections. It got so bad that nothing was working, not even the Monistat creams. I tried everything, short of going to the doctor with this embarrassing problem. I was certain I could cure this on my own. Well, the worse it got the more research I did on Candida. I realized it not only causes horrible vaginal infections, but horrible other symptoms as well! I could check off just about every single one of the Candida symptoms. That really raised an eyebrow. After more research, I learned yeast feeds on sugar. BINGO. I eat like crap, especially lots of sugars and carbs. And when my symptoms are really bad, it’s usually after a few days of eating an overload of sugary junk food and sweetened beverages. I decided the yeast has to go, as I cannot deal with it any longer. I am following my own program, which immediately included cutting back on the sugar drastically. I’m also trying a homeopathic liquid called AquaFlora, which was overpriced and I didn’t give it high hopes, but it had good reviews on Amazon. I’m also taking YeastCleans, a blend of tea tree oil and caprylic acid in pill form, as well as some high potency probiotics, and even eating extra yogurt on top of that. Well, I started this all on Sunday night. It’s only Tuesday night, and while I’ve noticed a decrease in my itching “down there,” I’ve suddenly started feeling like crap. Flu-like, achy, and just crappy. I thought, Oh great, I’m coming down with the flu. After doing more research, I think what I’m experiencing is Candida die-off. The more I read the more it made sense, and it fits perfectly with what I’m experiencing. I think my massive “no holds barred” approach to kill the yeast is working…. a little too well. I believe the yeast is dying off at a rapid weight. I started downing lots of extra water to help my liver and organs deal with the onslaught. I think I’ll do the probiotic every other day if it gets worse, but I’m just so happy my approach is working. Even just changing my diet has made a huge difference in the way I feel, and it’s only been two days! Unreal how much chaos candida causes in the body. I had no idea. Thanks for listening…. I’m just so happy something is finally WORKING!"

0,Coopster,67,"Hello, I am a 34 year old male, very healthy in general (on the outside at least) for years. 6’1″, 175 lbs. Weight lifter. I was in the best shape of my life when 3 months ago I got a sinus infection and was prescribed a z-pack for it and came down with a yeast infection in my genital area. Shortly thereafter I developed oral thrush. Here is how my treatment has gone: Saw nurse practitioner- prescribed nystatin oral and ketoconazole for skin. One week and no change at all, so I went to my normal doctor. Doctor prescribed 5 days diflucan. Lots of greek yogurt. After five days, no change. At this point I had not changed my diet at all and was very uninformed. If I had known about the risks, I would have taken precautions. After much research I realized that the antibiotics I had taken once a year for a sinus/chest infection (on average), and before my dental appointments (had a heart surgery 15 years ago) had probably wrecked my gut flora and was perhaps causing me problems unknown. I had abdominal pains a couple weeks after seeing my doctor and the thrush and genital area were looking very bad, so I went to the ER. Blood tests all came back fine. A CT scan was performed to check out my spleen, stomach, etc. All OK. Doc gave me a 10 day diflucan prescription and a steriod/anntifungal for the skin and sent me home. I then began a treatment of boric acid, borax, and tea tree oil for the penile thrush. It slowly cleared up. I still notice a very small spots, but overall, it is fine. Three weeks after seeing the doctor, he wanted to send me to an infectious disease specialist, but there are only three in the area where I live, and the they are booked for months. So I decided to try on my own. So I cut out all sugar. I did not realize that starches are a no-no also. Tried gentian violet, with mixed success. Would lessen syptoms, but not completely clear up the thrush. Also tried lemon juice for the thrush, but my teeth started hurting, so I quit it. After the initial herx (see below)from the candida diet I retried the Nystatin. It made things worse. The sugar in it I assume. I also tried almond milk (sugar free) after the herx because I was craving milk. It also caused a mild breakout. I will be trying coconut milk next. Now I am on the following protocol: Anticandida diet- Now on third week. Had serious herx reaction after 5 days including fever, fatigue, shakes, brain fog, and incribly horrible oral thrush. I could barely move my jaw it was so bad. Unable to chew food. Severely swollen glands. This lasted for 4 days. Grapefruit seed extract- began this with the diet, likely the reason for the serious herx. Cut back on it for a week, now back on it. I dissolve 25 drops in a half liter of distilled water and sip it all day. Coconut oil (organic)- started this a week ago after the initial herx. 2 tablespoons a day. One in morning, one at night. Pau d’Arco tea- at least one cup a day. Usually two. Lemongrass tea- dosage same as Pau d’ Arco tea. Garlic- raw and high allicin tablets. sometimes more raw, other times more of the pills. But at least twice daily. Borax/saltwater- swish in mouth several times a day. I also am mixing 1/8 tspn borax in 1 liter of water and sipping it all day. Aplle cider vinegar, organic, with the mother- a couple tablespoons mixed with bottled water daily. Mezosilver collloidial silver- was initally taking a tablespoon twice a day, but have decided to only swish and spit, as it kills good bacteria along with the bad. I may return to swallowing it now that I know I am taking plenty of probiotics. Oil of Oregano- was doing three drops in each dose of coconut oil, but stopped for same reason as the colloidial silver. For cleansing- Molybdenum (daily). Phsyllium, bentonite clay (every other day). Kefir- making my own. 1/2 cup twice daily. Yogurt- Organic Bulgarian whole milk. 1/2 cup daily. Ultimate flora critical care probiotic 50 billion- one tablet daily. Acidopholus 3 billion- 4 or 5 daily. Vitamins- folic acid/b complex, C, D, fish oil, flaxseed oil, K, alpha lipoic acid, glucosamine Up next: Have ordered lufenuron (I know about the mixed reivews). Diflucan- 2 weeks worth of 200 mg. to stack with the lufenuron. Also will start milk thistle and SF722 soon. I may order Candizyme and Candigone just for good measure. I should mention that I do not have to work much right now, as my job is seasonal and I have the winters off. I can rest all I need. Otherwise this would be near impossible to implement. My goal is to lick this before I have to start working again in April. Will continue to post progress as things happen. I am throwing everything I can at the candida in hopes of simply overwhelming it, while monitoring my die off. I am going to increase my calorie intake with coconut bread, avocados, and basically anything that the diet allows, as I have lost 8 pounds in 3 weeks on the diet. (The not being able to chew did not help). I am using gentian violet right now to make sure the oral thrush doesn’t flare up before I can start the lufenuron/diflucan. I am focussing on the graoefruit seed extract, coconut oil, borax, and probiotics right now. It’s hard to keep up with it all, but at least I have the time. Mentally, I am quite spent, and have some mild depression over it all. I had big plans for the winter, but these have been put on hold until I get this under control at least. The purple lips from the GV don’t help my social life, either. LOL For all you out there in the same boat, keep fighting, don’t give up."
1,Coopster,67,"I received the lufenuron today. I took the first dose with several pieces of baked chicken (with skin), an avocado, and whole milk bulgarian yogurt. My oral thrush seems to fluctuate from day to day. I am going to stop using the gentian violet for the next week so that I can monitor developments. I am suffering from some intense gas today, which started shortly after drinking a glass of borax/lemon water this morning. So the borax is doing something (good or bad). I also have a slightly runny nose, so I will monitor that, also. I ordered candizyme, terrazyme, and candigone today. The plan is to absolutely destroy the cell walls of the candida and let my immune system, antifungals, and probiotics do the rest. I spent a large part of the day researching foods and recipes for the candida diet. For those out there that think it is hell to be on the diet- I disagree. I already feel better in general than I did before, even with the weight loss, and there are a LOT of good tasting, filling foods out there if one is willing to cook for his/herself. I am going shopping tomorrow and going to try some more out. Knowing that what I am putting in my body is healthy is very reassuring. I decided I am also going to start slowly building up my exercise routine. I simply cannot stand the muscle atrophy that is setting in. Exercise in proper amounts strengthens the immune system anyways. I will start slowly and only do anaerobic exercises (weight lifting). I will make sure that I am well rested and fully recovered after one workout before doing another. Total wellness attack here."
2,Coopster,67,"Today has gone as follows: Woke up, swished with saltwater/borax, followed by colloidial silver. Drank Pau d’ Arco tea. Took a 50 bil probiotic pill. I waited 2 hours to eat breakfast. I had a normal bowel movement for the first time since starting the diet (been constipated). Last night I took 300 mg of Magnesium to try and help. Worked great. 5 eggs, blender mix of cilantro, greens, and lemon juice. Went to gym and did a medium workout- enough to feel tired but not spent completely. Lunch- baked chicken, organic yogurt with lufenuron second dose, raw spinach. I have been sipping apple cider vinegar/grapefruit seed extract water all day. A little borax water at times, also. I just had a snack of coconut bread. And have noticed that I have a runny nose and some sinus pressure/slight headache. This may be another herx coming on. I am going to stay heavy on the water and if it gets worse start with the molybdenum. The gentian violet has worn off my mouth in most places (takes a couple days). I was initially worried about an outbreak without it, but it seems to be holding steady for now. Ordered some Candizyme, Candigone, and Methylene blue. The MB sounds promising, especially for the oral thrush."
3,Coopster,67,"I ate dinner: One half baked chicken breast, green beans cooked in olive oil with garlic, and quinoa. I also took a molybdenum since I have a sinus headache now. Took one of Ted from Bangkok’s alkalizing drinks made with lime and baking soda. I will be doing two of these daily. I am using my mouth as a barometer for the herx along with the mucous/sinus issue. I hope it gets a little worse so I will have no doubt as to what is going on. The I will treat with Phsyllium and bentonite clay along with the milk thistle. I will eat some more yorgurt before bed then brush my teeth and treat my mouth with saltwater/borax."
0,arw89,68,"Hey guys, I have been on the candida diet for around 3 weeks now… for 2 weeks I have been eating a nice probiotic yogurt and it normally doesn’t have a strong taste. However, 2 days ago the very same yogurt began to taste sooo sour!!! Ugh I just can’t eat it now! I’m not sure what changes taste buds go through when you quit sugar but do you think this is a possible reaction? Thanks 🙂"
0,caterina81,69,"Hi everyone, I’m Catherine 33 and my daughter Jessica is 8, 9 in a few weeks and live in the UK. Im a single mummy, run my own business from home and also home-school. I’ve been battling with thrush since my daughter was born in 2005, I tore at birth (only 1st degree) maybe that was the initial cause. I had it on and off, mainly after intercourse. That was how it was for many years, Id have the odd pessary and it would be ok for a while then back again. I’ve suffered with hypoglycaemia/low blood sugar all my life, pretty much everyone on my mothers side from my grandfather have it also. We have ALL dealt with it badly, basically because we didn’t know what it was. By badly I mean we dealt with it with sugar! High sugar diets not so high fat..which obviously makes it worse. In 2011 I had 3 courses of antibiotics and this is when things started to get worse. Poor diet and possibly the hardest year of my life and it just went crazy. I was in so much pain the creams wouldn’t work the pessary’s didn’t work. I was in and out of the clinic with “yes you have a yeast infection, here’s another pessary” no help at all, I told them “they don’t work!” they didn’t care. So that was that..I basically had to live with awful painful lady bits. I used way too much creams over the years. Early 2013 I had a copper coil fitted. In 2012 the doctors refused to put it in as it would push the thrust up inside my body. 2013 I guess I had a good couple of good weeks and when I asked for it in desperation for some birth control, they fitted it. Gradually over the last almost 2 years it’s got so much worse. I have thrush in my mouth too now, white tongue. I started to feel mentally not right, incredibly sensitive to everything also, touch smell etc. Anxiety, depression then major highs. Hardly any energy, poor sleep, glands (neck and groin) swollen constantly, dandruff, my hairs been falling out at a scary rate, ringing in my ears 10 times a day, heart palps, major brain fog, stars in the corners of my eyes (I think that’s a sugar low though) and always ill, I just get every bug under the sun, consitpation then weeks of diarrhoea and vice versa, bloating, and heartburn feelings. I am desperate now to get better so finally taking the plunge to love myself and my body and treat it right my whole life is suffering majorly for it. Ive been researching it for so long and time to put my health first for a change! (cant believe I joined this forum May 2013, slaps self) So then there is my beautiful daughter Jess. I actually had no idea she had candida until a couple of weeks ago, I think must be also caused by anti-b.  Jess for about 4 years has gotten ill a lot, she would bring every bug home from school and was always off with something. She had the worst ‘growing pains’ (not growing pains) her teacher was not very sympathetic and would shout at her for complaining of the pain. One of the reasons I took her out, it was torture for her. She also went to the doctors who referred her to the hospital for a check over…guess what “she’s fine, just growing pains” Poor Jess really has had it bad with her legs and recently her back too after she started a martial arts class. She would always be a little better at summer time, she would improve greatly so she joined a home school class to keep fit. I had to take her out of it too when her symptoms came back even worse than before. She also has athletes foot, white tongue, itchy lady parts and bottom, itchy skin, irritating eyes, constipation, poor concentration, brain freeze, finds it hard sometimes to think properly when speaking, constant infections, brown mucus coming from her ears, and poor energy levels when doing even a short walk. But with all that, Jess other than being in pain after walking somewhere is an incredibly happy girl, she really is, everyone points out what a pleasure she is to be around. My little angel! I feel awful not knowing Jess had it too, all this time ive been feeding the candida sweets, we actually have a normal diet just darn sweets added to it. I feel pretty horrendous about it all. Annoyed all this time back and forth to the docs and zero help, just another pill.. Anyway I always believe there’s a positive to be found in everything and here I believe Id never have gone on a healthy diet without it, so a slap in the face was needed. If you saw me and Jess on the street you would think we were very healthy beings, both slim and good skin tone.. funny that! I haven’t gone full into the candida diet because for one im worried about the die off and I am a single mum running a business and have zero help. Two I don’t think I could mentally cope with cold turkey style and 3 I’m worried what they say in the gaps vs candida diet about cutting out all sugars may be true. It really is incredible the amount of conflict on every single thing about the candida diet. Its hard enough having candida but omg researching it is a killer. Many say its acidic, others its alkaline. Some say cancer cant grow in alkaline conditions, cancer docs say it starts in candida alkaline conditions and the cancer makes it acidic (so that worries me a lot), others say take vits then others say dont it feeds the candida, some say eliminate all sugars, others (gaps) say this is the worst thing you can do.. its mentally destroying just looking for an answer. I guess thats why we are all here to help one another find the RIGHT answer. So basically at the moment I have thought to myself to get healthy anyway, its a start at least! So since Saturday we cut out the sugar as in white sugar so far and bread. When i get sugar lows I go for a cracker with organic butter and organic peanut butter. Were basically eating healthy rather than a candida diet as such with added supplements. I’m taking a 14 strain Probiotic twice a day, 100mg Chlorophyll, 400iu Vit E, 500mg Neem Leaf and 150mg Oregano Oil twice a day and just started also taking Candiaclear (calcium octanoate, magnesium octanoate which generate 265 & 290 octanoic acid, pau d’arco, thyme, rosemary, lemon balm) I also had my copper coil removed Monday! So we are basically eating a normal healthy diet 99% organic. There are lots of thing we eat that are not on the candida diet but im seeing how this goes by just cutting out the crap and taking supplements. I’m also drinking cider apple vinegar, kefir and night, docuhing with coconut oil and a few ess.oils and scrubbing my tongue with bicarbonate of soda and coconut oil. In the mornings I drink hot water with half a lemon, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, 1tbsp grated ginger. So far the first day i woke up feeling amazing, I think possibly for once i had a great night sleep. But since then Ive felt poorly, worse than ever, my upper body hurts, very sore throat, jelly legs and no energy. Mentally on edge, but that comes and goes, like im bipolar! Next minute i feel ok again. But my lady bits are fine though! Yesterday I decided to add Vitamin C to my diet which was a big mistake as I didn’t check the ingredients. Just an hour after and my lady bits felt itchy, my tongue fuzzed up like never before, its not ever been that white before! The darn tablets had Maltodextrin in it, I’ve read they are even worse than sugar for candida! So anyway i scrubbed my tongue, ate a raw garlic clove, took my usual tablets and drank some cider vinegar which all very much helped. Im buying some Grapefruit seed extract for Jess also as other than the diet, she is only taking the probiotic and only 1 a day. I heard its good… I’ll update maybe in a week or so 🙂 look forward to reading others updates as they get well. Good luck everyone, we can do it!! Cat x"

My daughter certainly has been, she wont walk anywhere far due to her leg pain. Its obviously due to the candida wiping her of vitamin D. She took vitamins and it was much better but then they seem to make no difference again. It worries me that it if anything helps the candida by feeding them more by taking the suppliments. Moving to a hot country would help lol but I sadly cant do that and I cannot stand the heat since my overgrowth got worse. We’ll get there! 🙂"

Hi Solarspirit Thanks, yes I agree slowly rather than diving into it. I’ve been eating healthy for a week now however I see what items I still need to remove as they cause my tongue to flare up. Im constantly in the mirror before and after meals now checking my tongue haha. I felt terribly about day 2 and 3 all the die off symptoms but I think with not going cold turkey Im still feeding the little buggers. I still dont feel well but not so bad I cant leave the house etc. I read about the biofilms yesterday and will look further into thanks and see how i can kill em off the best way and not like many have a flare up soon as they eat something not on the candida diet. Cheers 🙂"
0,slinky,70,"Hello there. Im new to this forum…. here’s my candida story… Throughout my life suffered from yeast intolerances/food allergies and bouts of thrush. When i have had thrush i have been able to treat it with boric acid pessaries and ketaconazole. 7 years ago i had chronic fatigue for three years and managed to beat most of the symptoms with a thing called the lightening process. Many of my symptoms have gone i.e. the tiredness etc, but I still have a very weak immune system, frequent sinus infections etc. After the chronic faitgue i developed hip problems and have had 3 surgeries on my hips, each time taking anti-inflmmatories (with no instruction to take PPIs at the same time). On top of this I had two other operations in the same time (more private). At the end of last year I went through a horrible situation at work – I worked in investment banking so very stressful and ended up having to sue my company for harassment. This was at the same time i broke up with my long term boyfriend, and had a hip operation so was on anti-inflammatories. I also had a severe sinus infection so was on antibiotics for 2 months also. Anyway, that was when I finally broke my system I think, since then I now have chronic thrush, bad gastritis and stomach ulcers and just discovered i have some type of parasites. Did i mention im only 35 lol. Since March I have been on the following protocol with no success (as well as not working so my stress levels are normal now); Strict Anti-candida diet. Ketaconozaole (2 month stint) Sporonox (take 2 once a week) GSE Candex Colliodal Silver Paul D’Arco Probiotics x a lot Mag, zinc, vit z Digestive enzymes Garlic Oil Of oregano Caparylic acid (i rotate this) I fell off the diet wagon four months in as I had no success and had to have another hip operation – needed a stiff drink to perk me up. Anyway I a am now back on the wagon being even more strict and 4 weeks in and I am not feeling any different. I’ve just started a parasite cleanse too. Does anyone have any advise? Im looking at trying to take lufernuron too and just stick to what I am doing. Its pretty depressing, ive had 7 years of bad health problems and this just takes the biscuit to have this on top of everything. Not to mention I have three weddings coming up and i would love a drink but i know thats not allowed! One other question – could my gastritis be related to the candida and parasites? My gastroent is at a loss why I still have it as im off the NSAIDs and eating very healthily. tips or words of wisdom much appreciated…."
1,slinky,70,"forgot to add, I am resistant to all the topical creams, boric acid is the only thing which keep sit at bay but obviously dont want to take it long term…. Also want to try and get pregnant at the end of the year so really need to rid myself of this candida before then…. thanks"

(Yes, I know these have carbs. But your body comes first. It makes no sense to starve yourself in the process of starving a fungus.) Go and see a chiropractor or naturopath trained to use standard process supplements and they can prescribe you the right glandulars to build your immune system back up again. Then rent your favorite funny movies, drink that glass of alcohol, and get back on the lightening therapy."

Sorry for the mistakes, Iam in the hurry… IRDK, I believe heavy metal toxicity is far more common then people believe. Initially, I assumed this condition was for those with dental amalgams. I was very wrong. Dysbiosis + fish diet is dangerous. I would start chelating with DMPS first. It’s proven both effective and safe for mercury chelation. There are a minority of people that have serious reactions to DMSA. DMSA is effective, but should be the 2nd choice. I think Andy Cutler’s Protocol is great.  Except I DO NOT agree on people chelating with ALA alone. Are you familiar with this protocol? -D"

Sorry for the mistakes, Iam in the hurry… Hey IRDK, I’m really glad you’re looking into chelation. It has helped me a great deal thus far and I continue to feel a bit better after each round. I’m not sure if you’ve read my post history or not, but I also became mercury poisoned after bodybuilding, eating lots of salmon/tuna etc. More than a couple of users on this forum have reported a similar thing happening. Our health history sounds pretty damn similar plus we’re both around the same age. I think you’ll respond positively similar to how I did. A couple of things: Andy Cutler’s chelation protocol is by far the most safe and effective chelation protocol out there. The most important tenet of the protocol is taking the chelator, whether it is DMPS, DMSA, or ALA, according to its half-life. This means taking the chelator every so many hours (each chelator has a different half-life) for several days (a typical round is 3-4 days) and then at least as many days off so that your body can recover fully. I highly recommend you get both of Andy Cutler’s books which explain how you can get through the chelation process as smoothly as possible, what supplements to take for different symptoms etc. I believe I shared this link with you previously, but this site breaks down how to chelate very well and is something that you should go by: http://www.livingnetwork.co.za/chelationnetwork/chelation-the-andy-cutler-protocol/ Since you don’t have any dental work to be cleaned up you can start chelation any time. You might want to get on some basic supplements first and/or clean your diet up some first though. I agree with Danny33 that DMPS chelation is a safe-bet and is a great way to get started removing mercury without introducing too many side-effects that ALA chelation might bring on. My rounds with DMPS are pretty much symptom free at this point and I actually feel quite good while I’m on round. That said, at some point you have to introduce ALA because that is how you remove mercury and other heavy metals from the brain and internal organs. This is the most important step and where the real problem lies. DMPS and DMSA are used to assist the chelation process when taken with ALA and when taken alone help to lower the body-burden of mercury and other heavy metals. I’ve been chelating with DMPS alone for 6 months now and I’m actually starting my first ALA round today. I’m very much looking forward to seeing how it goes. If you have a facebook you should join this group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/acfanatics/ Also, this forum is dedicated to those chelating using Cutler’s protocol and people there will be happy to answer any questions/concerns you might have: https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/frequent-dose-chelation/info"

Mercury chelation is only useful if you have a mercury poisoning. Luckily, various posts in this forum indicate that it’s quite simple to determine if you have mercury poisoning. So please, have some reliable measurements done first. I’m writing this because chelation has lots of disadvantages. That’s no problem if you really have a mercury poisoning, because in that case removing the mercury would be so important that you would accept the toxic effects of the chelators. But if you have no mercury poisoning, you would be stressing your body with the toxic effects of chelation, and there would be no advantage at all. Please remember that chelation has an effect on many aspects of the body because it interferes with basic cell metabolism. So use it if you need it, but stay away from it if you don’t need it.

Dysbiosis + fish diet is dangerous. Correct. There is no relation between dental amalgams and the amount of mercury in the body. This was measured in various organs of volunteers after they died – so this is the most reliable measurement possible.Danny33;58793 wrote: I would start chelating with DMPS first. It’s proven both effective and safe for mercury chelation. These last three words are the key. Only, I repeat: only, use DMPS if, and only if, you have a proven mercury problem. Not a suspected one. Have a measurement done. Measurements are possible and not too hard to perform. DMPS has disadvantages. Only use it when you are very certain that you have mercury chelation. Otherwise, you are accepting the poisonous effects of DMPS without any benefit. Rabelais"

8,Rabelais,71,"  Sorry, but “the internetz” is not a reliable source. You probably know that you can find anything on “the internetz”. I sure hope you don’t believe anything you find out there. (Note: I’m not defying or denying your statement. All I’m doing is asking for a source.)   I don’t understand your reply “most”.   You state that the chelation chemicals can pass the blood-brain barrier. Once again, I’m not defying or denying your statement, I’d just like to have some source. I’m fine to believe this statement, it doesn’t contradict any current knowledge. I’d just like to know whether it’s true. A good source would help me more than “because TCO says so”. Rabelais  "

Once again, I’m not defying or denying your statement, I’d just like to have some source. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-lipoic_acid Okay, thanks. I read a few interesting things here. One of these is that DMPS, which is often advised on this forum, does not cross the blood-brain barrier. If most mercury would indeed reside in the brain, as you state, then chelating with DMPS would be useless, right? Another thing is that ALA, wich does cross the blood-brain barrier, may cause headaches, tingling or a “pins and needles” sensations, skin rashes, and muscle cramps. It may also result in the occurrence of a normally rare condition called insulin autoimmune syndrome, which causes hypoglycemia, and which produces antibodies that attack the body’s own insulin. In addition, the safety of ALA in people with kidney or liver problems is unknown. This is the very reason why I so strongly advise against using chelation “just for the fun of it”. It has side effects. There is a risk. Especially if your health isn’t top nodge to start with, you’d better avoid yet another blow to your body’s balance. Finally, I’ve asked for a source of your statement that most mercury would settle itself in the brain. Perhaps you forgot, anyway you didn’t provide a source yet. Rabelais  "

13,Rabelais,71,"  I am not criticizing chelation. I am criticizing chelation without previously measuring whether or not you are poisoned.   If I understand correctly, both DMPS and DMSA are unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. None of these chemicals can therefore reach the brain, which is where most of the mercury hides itself (which is, by the way, still an unproven statement because you still haven’t provided a source). This is my current knowledge. If you can enhance my limited knowledge, please do so. Rabelais  "

0,LHM,72,"I have had candidate issues for 25 years after a long course of antibiotics to treat a staph infection. I am now working with a functional medicine practitioner and have made LOTS of changes. I was treated for parasites, I had significant bacteria overgrowth. For 8 weeks I’ve been on a pretty strict anti-candida diet, meat, non-starchy vegetables, nuts and nut products, few beans as prescribed by my doctor. I am taking strong probiotics, G-Microb X, digestive enzymes, Vit D (all prescribed) as well as garlic, pau d’arco. I still drink a little black coffee. I went on an elimination diet before the candida diet so I am aware of my food sensitivities: grain, gluten, dairy, strawberries, wheat, quinoa. My issues are that I am still often constipated and that I am really frustrated with my food options. I should probably be drinking more water. I guess I don’t know if I am making progress. My rational self knows that I have to be patient, that this is a short time given the long duration of my illness: I just need an attitude adjustment, I guess — to hear from people who have worked on this alone and feel like they got somewhere."
0,CandidaTeen,73,"Alright so let me start by saying that there is no way to keep this short. The story I will tell in this post will be very long and will cover many years of my life. I will sometimes mention the years as school years (2010-2011) instead of 2010 for example, since that’s mostly how I remember them. Some of you might think “We don’t need your life story”, but I believe that my full story is relevant to my situation. All of the symptoms I mentioned here have accumulated over time and have not gone away (unless stated otherwise). Also, I will talk about a lot of personal things in my life and I describe some embarassing symptoms. So I ask for your full respect when reading this as most of you have been through candida or are going through it right now and you might know how it feels to have certain symptoms which you don’t want to talk about. I won’t hide any of my symptoms or anything about my story as I feel like this could delay my recovery, so some of the things I describe may be just normal things that happen to everybody instead of actual symptoms. If that is the case, please let me now. Finally, please don’t treat me any differently just because I am a teenager. I am sick of doctors and other people who have ignored and not given my case any attention simply because I am not an adult. I am a 15 year old male, born on March 1999 in Lisbon, Portugal (so please forgive me if I make any stupid typing mistakes as my browser does not correct text in English). You can call me JC if you want. Atleast that’s what my friends call me. Before I tell my story: I am almost entirely sure at this point that I am suffering from a systemic candida infection. Pretty much all of my symptoms and health problems match this condition ever since they began, and I have also been subjected to some things which make a candida infection more probable in my body. For example, I know that my mother had a lot of mercury fillings when she was pregnant of me, and I think that I might possibly have some level of mercury toxicity. I also had a lot of stressfull events happen in my life in the years in which my symptoms got worse. Please do not call me a hypochondriac or tell me it’s all in my head since I don’t have an official diagnosis from a licensed doctor. I have heard that from a lot of people ever since I started suspecting I was ill. I am absolutely sure that there is something limiting my health, and I am 99% sure that candida is that thing. As a child I was always very energetic, athletic, and happy. I would wake up every morning full of energy and I could run around and play for the entire day without getting the least bit tired. At night when it was time to go to sleep, I would always fall asleep very quickly and I would wake up the next morning feeeling rested and full of energy again. I remember that for whatever reason I was always constipated as a child. I only went to the bathroom to defecate every 3 or 5 days. On the other hand, I was always thirsty and I drank lots and lots of water all the time, which made me urinate very frequently. For some reason I was never able to satisfy my thirst, and I still can’t do that today. I feel like since I was a child I have always been constantly thirsty no matter how much water I drink. I remember having somewhat frequent muscle twitches all over my body ever since I’ve been a child too. Also, my mother tells me that I frequently had ear pains as a child (although I don’t remember this since I was too young when this used to happened). Fast foward a few years and some real health problems began to develop (although nobody realized that back then). When I was about 8 years old I started having panic/anxiety attacks frequently. I would obsess over some illogical fear to the point in which I would freak out and hyperventilate within seconds. I always thought that I was going to die because I had caught some sort of rare disease or I had been infected by some tropical parasite or whatever. I would obsess over my heart rate and my blood pressure and everything of that sort, even though I was perfectly healthy on that level back then. I had no real psychological reason to have these attacks. My life was great, my family was loving and wealthy, I had plenty of great friends, and I had been quite healthy up until that point. Nothing was wrong in my life on an emotional level, but I was still freaking out about these illogical fears that I came up with. Then about 1 year later something weird started to happen. You know how during the day you don’t really notice your breathing, it is something that your body does naturally and automatically. But for some reason that year, I felt like that automatic body function had stopped working for me. I became fully conscious of my breathing and I was obsessing over it all the time which made me hyperventilate frequently even more. I told my parents about this and asked to see a doctor. I went to the doctor and I ran some routine tests. The tests came back all normal and the doctor said nothing was wrong with me. I was put in counceling. The counceling didn’t really do much. As far as I remember, all I did was go into the councelor’s office and play with toys during the entirety of the appointment. However these irrational fears and obsessions eventually went away with time and I was mentally/emotionally healthy again. I feel like my breathing became sort of irregular after that year, although I stopped being conscious about it. There was one other thing which changed in my body that year but I never had considered it a symptom: My joints began to crack really easily. I now could easily crack my knuckles, or my jaw, or my knees, or anything at all. Pretty much 90% of my joints became “crackable” in that year but I never saw that as a health problem or anything of that sort back then. Little did I know that that was just the beggining of some very bad years health-wise. 2009 came around. I remember this year as a dark year in my life. The company which both of my parents had worked in for almost their entire lives was going broke and they became depressed. Their marriage got worse and they would fight and argue constantly making me very stressed and worried all the time. This is the year I remember in which all of my main symptoms developed. During the summer of this year I randomly gained a lot of weight even though I didn’t change my diet or exercise. I went from being quite a skinny child to being an overweight child with 2 chins and a giant belly in the short space of 3 months. My heart rate got a lot faster and I started having palpitations. I could feel my heartbeat all over my body (and I still can) with such force that it felt like it moved me from side to side whever I sat down. I became tired all the the time. I always felt exhausted and i already woke up tired in the morning. I had terrible sleep and I would wake up frequently during the night. I felt like no matter what I did, I could never refill my energy. My vision started getting blurry and odd. I felt sort of disconnected, like if I was seeing the world through a camera. I was there but I didn’t quite feel like I was there. Once again I asked my parents to see a doctor and once again they took me to one. I went to a GP and talked to him about my symptoms and that I was feeling tired all the time. He did some basic blood tests on me and told me that I was perfectly fine, and that I just needed to lose some weight. I then went to an ophthalmologist because of my vision. He did the simple eye test in which I just had to read some letters at a distance and told me that I was fine, since I did score 25% above average in the test. I don’t remember him having me do any other vision or eye tests. I also noticed that in that year I always had this sort of slight white/gray coating on my tongue as well as always having bad breath and a dry mouth, although I didn’t think any of this was a symptom of anything back then and I just ignored it. I figured that my symptoms were due to my recent gain in weight (I know it sounds extremely stupid to think that such symptoms can be simply caused by weight gain, but I didn’t know any better at the time). I did what the GP told me. I got determined to lose weight. I stopped eating sweets (especially cookies, which for some reason I started to crave a lot at the time), I stopped drinking soda and I only drank water, and I started doing more exercise. It worked. About 1 year later, in the school year of 2010-2011, I was back on a normal weight for my age and I did feel a bit better in some ways. I was sleeping better again and I was slightly more energetic, although I did still feel “ill” or “sick” in some way. I always had that feeling of malaise and I was still chronically fatigued, although less than the previous year. However, I just pretty much ignored all of my symptoms since doctors had always told me I was fine. Then something else started to happen. It was like my nostrils had closed. I could not breathe easily through my nose anymore and I was always congested there. I could never pull anything out of there when I blew my nose, and it did not run naturally down my nose either. I felt like someone had just stuck two wine corks in my nostrils and there was nothing I could do that would fix it or simply help it. I also started to have terrible headaches every day that year. I would feel the pain from the top of my nose all the way across my forehead and it would start almost every single day in the evening, sometimes even in the morning. Whenever I had a headache I would take an Iboprufen or an acetaminophen, so I would take atleast one of these almost every days. These drugs did nothing though and the only way I could make the headaches go away was by sleeping. At the end of this same school year (2010-2011) I remember that I was very frequently having very lose or separated stools and that many times this stool had mucus with it. However, I never payed much attention to this back then and I didn’t tell anyone. Some cognitive problems started happening that year as well. I had always been a very smart child with very articulate speech. However I rememeber that in that year I started having a sort of difficulty in talking sometimes and I would frequently mess up words or syllables and switch them around in sentences. I also lost another automatic body function similarly to what happened a few years before when I became conscious of my breathing. This time, I became conscious of my eye contact and I had no idea where to look when talking to people. This made me somewhat socially akward and I couldn’t hold conversations for very long anymore. This symptom would come and go (and still does) as I went through periods of feeling better or worse. Also, it turns out I had been anemic for most of that school year (proved by my blood tests of that year), but my GP at the time did not notify me since she didn’t even notice, which just proves that she really did not care about me (I only found out about this last year when I changed my GP). Then came the school year of 2011-2012. During this year I pretty much completely lost my sense of smell as my nose continued to be constantly congested. My sleep quality was terrible. I would take hours to fall asleep, and when I did, I would wake up all the time during the night. I became sleepy during the day on top of the chronic fatigue I already had back then. I started having what can be described as brain fog, although I had never heard that term back then. My concentration went down the drain and I could not focus on anything. I would procrastinate all day long at home and I would end up doing my homework past midnight, which made my sleep quality even worse. My biological clock was completely out of tune. I would feel more energetic at 3 A.M. at home then I ever did during the entire day. My short term memory also became terrible, and I could not remember what I had done the day before or even what I had done 1hr before. School became a lot tougher that year for me and I had to spend a lot more time working to maintain good grades since I could not concentrate well anymore. When the next school year came (2012-2013) I was still feeling terrible. I had abandoned the idea that I had some sort of illness or sickness as all the doctors I went to told me I was fine. . I just thought that I felt that way because it was normal and everybody felt that way too. I remember that in a particular normal check-up appointment in September of that school year, it was discovered that I had high colesterol, which I found odd considering that I had been having quite a relaitevely healthy diet back then (I avoided eating sweets or fat foods and only ate “normal” food). The GP just told me that it was probably something genetic or whatever and didn’t pay much attention to it. I kept on feeling terrible that year. I thought that maybe doing more exercisee would make me feel better, and so I joined the school’s basketball team. I did a lot more exercise that year than I had ever done before and I thought that that would help me feel more energetic. it didn’t quite work that way though. I felt so much worse. My muscles were constantly sore from all of the exercise, and they would never recover no matter for how long I rested. My joints which already cracked easily, started cracking involuntarily with every day movements. Whenever I put my foot on the ground a toe would crack. Whenever I turned around, my back would crack. Whenever I stood up, my knee would crack, etc. My chronic fatigue stayed the same and didn’t improve at all. I started having aches in my heart every once in a while like if someone was squishing it, and sometimes when doing sports, my heart rate would become erratic and spring up and down regardless of the level of physical activity I was undertaking. I became quite gassy after each meal (the gas was mostly released in the form of burps) and I would feel bloated whenever I ate a main course. Whenever I sat down and stood up again, my belly skin would have red marks form where it folded when I sat down. I began catching common colds and other mild diseases very easily and they would take much longer to heal than normally. I also had athlete’s foot this year, but I thought it was normal since I did make the mistake of walking barefoot in the locker rooms. I also started sweating excessively in my feet. I became intolerant to low temperatures, and I would start shivering very easily. My speech problems which had temporarily improved came back in full force, and I had trouble forming simple sentences both when talking and writing. My overall body feeling began to vary very quickly without reason. One moment I was feeling extremely light heaeded as if I was about to faint (I also always felt like I was going to faint whenever I streched or stood up quickly) and the next moment I was feeling extremely angry or excited (I now attribute this to irregular blood sugar levels). I developed a constant pressure in my head, and I could no longer place my head underneath my body for more than a few seconds as it felt like it was going to explode. Most of my cravings also developed at the beggining of the school year. I started craving raw bread. I would constantly eat loafs of raw bread with nothing else. Additionaly, I also started craving bread and cheese, of which I would always eat a bunch of it every day. And finally, I also began craving vinegar, which was odd since I didn’t like its taste very much. Because of this vinegar craving, I would eat pickles all the time (sometimes I would even wake up in the middle of the night, go to the kitchen and eat pickles, even though I despised their flavour). I developed severe acne on my back, shoulders, arms, and chest. This sort of acne was not just pimples. Every single pore of my skin in those areas was either red or filled with a greasy yellow substance that would turn into a pimple filled with pus if not removed. One other thing which developed during that year was problems “down there”. However very mild ones at the time. The only thing that changed was that I was having some difficulty initiating urination (for some reason it felt like something was clogging the way or something like that). Then came the school year of 2013-2014, which was last year. This school year was probably the worst of my life health wise. In the first semester (2013), my chronic fatigue became intolerable. I couldn’t take it anymore. I was sleeping through all my classes but I still couldn’t sleep well at night. My sleep quality got so bad that when morning came I wasn’t even sure if I had slept at all during the night. My memory completely died, I could not recall things which had just happened seconds ago. My brain fog became so bad I couldn’t do simple 1st grade math without having to double check everything I did. I felt lightheaded and dizzy frequently. My muscles became weak and I was trembling all the time. My libido died completely, and sexual feelings and thoughts just disappeared which made me develop erectile dysfunction (at the age of 14 which makes me feel extremely frustrated). My body temperature was always off. I always felt either extremely cold (shivering) or extremely warm (sweating). I became depressed without even realizing it. I wasn’t exactly sad all the time, I was just emotionally dead. I couldn’t feel happiness, or excitement, or love, or compassion, or anything at all. I was like a robot when it came to emotions. Stomach aches and irregular bowel movements became part of my routine. Random muscle twitchings became much more frequent and intense. My joints would ache all the time, and I developed a constant dull pain on the right side of my abdomen (that would sometimes shift up and down my abdomen, and I could feel it almost all the time). Then came the second semester of that school year (2014), and my symptoms got worse than ever. I started drinking occasionally (yes I began drinking at 14, get over it, it’s normal in my culture) and I feel like this might have made the candida quite worse. I did stop already, as now I know that it makes candida worse. My eyes lost the ability to focus easily, and my peripheral vision was gone (I felt like I was seeing everything in tunnel vision all the time). On top of this, my eyes also became intolerant to light and I could not stand outside during a sunny day or look at a tv screen as my eyes would start hurting immediatly. My ears started ringing frequently and would ache every once in a while. I developed these two lumps on the side of each of my feet, and I still don’t know what they are today. My blood circulation became terrible (atleast that’s what I think the problem is, I’m not sure though, maybe it’s LGS?). My extremeties got numb very easily all the time, I could not be in any position other than standing up or sitting straight down without feeling some part of my body going numb within seconds, and my hands and feet were always cold. My throat became chronically sore and I always had mucus on the back of it. The skin around my lips became bad and dry all the time, and the thrush in my mouth (what I called the gray/white substance) got a lot worse, and I also developed some small white bumps on the back of my tongue. I also started having pains in the bone in the middle of my chest, which now I think is due to a candida infection in my windpipe. My problems down there got a lot worse during the second semester of last school year as well. Not only did I lose my ability to have frequent erections, but also my penis decreased significantly in size and density when flaccid. i can still have erections if I try veeery hard (which shouldn’t have to be the case), and when I do, my penis is mostly back to the size it was before my problems started in that area. However it is a lot softer and not nearly as hard as it was, even when erect. My foreskin became red and infected and the head of my penis went from purple to a pinkish-red color and began flaking off. These problems make me extremely frustrated, especially considering I am only 15 years old and that I should not have to worry about anything like this until I am an elderly man. At the point in which these more worrying symptoms developed (from February to June this year) I became more depressed than I had ever been. I was seriously considering suicide a few months back and I even had a plan of how I was going to do it. Luckily I do not think much about that anymore. Up until the beginning of summer this year, I had no clue what was causing my health problems. After researching a lot during these last few months (and trust me I did my research very carefully and didn’t just believe everything I read on the internet as some might think), I found that candida is probably the cause of my symptoms ever since they began 7 years ago. Everything from my illogical obsessions, to my chronic fatigue, and to my sexual problems can be mostly explained by candida (and the resulting symptoms of other conditions it causes such as OCD, adrenal fatigue, and leaky gut syndrome). The problem is I’m having a hard time finding anyone in the medical field who even believes in systemic candida. I went to a couple of different doctors this summer, of which none considered candida as a a cause of my symptoms (they didn’t even consider systemic candida existed at all). My parents didn’t believe me either when I told them that candida was probably the problem. In fact, they don’t even believe I feel ill at all since all doctors I go to seem to say otherwise, and so they just think I’m obsessing again like I did when I was 8 years old which makes it extremely hard for me to convince them to take me to doctors, especially now they are not as well off financially as they were many years ago. It is extremely frustrating to not have anyone believe me, having in mind that pretty much all of my symptoms can be explained by candida (and having in mind that some of my symptoms can ONLY be explained by candida). I cannot treat myself as I am just a teenager and I don’t know much about medical treatments, and it would probably be hard for my parents to treat me too considering that most candida products are not sold in Portugal as far as I know. I have convinced my mother to schedule an appointment with an alternative medicine practicioner who i think treats candida but the appointment is only in November, and I just can’t stand being in this condition for another month anymore (even though I’ve been feeling terrible for a very long time). I just don’t know what to do now. I’m desperate. I’m only a teenager and so I do not have the independance to take care of myself. Everything I do has to be approved by my parents, but they don’t even believe I’m ill. If I want to start seriously treating candida, I’ll have to wait until November, but even then I don’t know if this new doctor will believe me, since none of the other doctors I went to before did. And I can’t stand to wait until November. Every single day since about July of this year has been hell for me health wise. I can not take it anymore. I need help now! If you have any suggestions or tips of what I can do for now to ease my symptoms or to start treating candida, please tell me. I hate having to be in this condition. Thank you if you actually read all of this, it would feel great to have someone listen to me for once.1 user thanked author for this post.  5Roseray5"
1,raster,73,"My suggestion is to prove you have a problem and then you can get treatment. Check out the candia5 test, its pretty cheap. Additionally I would consider getting checked out for diabetes because this is often associated with constant thirst. Another problem is that you likely have a histamine intolerance issue which can be reversed with both natural and medicinal drugs…this is what can cause the anxiety and panic attacks. To me it sounds like you have a histamine problem that has been left unchecked and has caused a variety of other health problems. If you can travel to spain, I would consult with Dr. Prada Pascual. -raster"

I will try to get the candia5 test so I can prove to other people that I do have a candida problem (how reliable do you consider this test to be?). At first when you suggested I might have diabetes I wasn’t very convinced since I thought that if that was the case, it would’ve probably have been picked up by some routine blood test already. But I’ve done a bit of research and it seems like it is a strong possibility (type 2 especially), considering how my symptoms developed and considering that diabetes also seems to be linked to candida. Not to mention that my granddad also had diabetes. I will try to look into the histamine problem as well when I meet with my GP. I guess it’s not time to give up on the GP’s yet. Speaking hypothetically: Imagine I did have diabetes (along with candida). Would treating just the diabetes be enough to eliminate the candida problem and make me feel healthy again? Or would I have to treat both simultaneously? Finally, I don’t think I have much of a chance of traveling to Spain for health reasons until I can prove to other people that I do have a health problem indeed. So for now, whoever I can get in Portugal will have to do. Once again thank you, I truly appreciate your input!"
3,Danny33,73,"JC, Being constipated most of your life suggests you’ve had dysbiosis (crippled gut flora) most of your life. Gut flora is what makes your stool robust and hydrated. Remove that flora and your left with dry, undigested, and hard-to-pass stools. The majority of stool by weight is indeed bacteria, not food as some would suggest. I would assume your mother also has digestive or allergy complaints since that is who gave you your initial flora. Also, If you fed formula as an infant then you never really had a chance anyway. Forget the Candida test, you almost certainly suffer from the yeast syndrome + severe dysbiosis. I would also not be the slightest bit surprised if you suffer from toxic metals (Aluminum, Mercury, etc.). I share and have had many of your symptoms in the past.  I really feel sorry for people who have never had a chance to enjoy a healthy life. I enjoyed 23 years of perfect health until my 3 month adventure with anti-biotics back in 2008. What I can tell you is your fixable but it’s going to take time and a lot of work. Rule of thumb. If you suffer from severe dysbiosis you need to stop consuming toxic metals, this is important. Stop consuming mercury (Fish, seafood, etc.) as your body cannot excrete it properly without healthy flora. Stop using and consuming aluminum (Deodorant w/ Aluminum/Alum, aluminum foil, Aluminum pans, etc.) Baking powder with aluminum, coffee creamers, table salt, etc. Many of your symptoms mirror toxic metal sufferers, I have read hundreds of stories. Take it seriously. Keep asking questions and research as much as you can. Good luck. -D"

6,raster,73,"One thing you could do is go to an allergist and ask them to test to see if you are allergic to candida. If you are allergic to candida, it means that your body isn’t fighting it. You then could get prescribed candida hypersensitization shots (costs about $750/6months US) which then increase your immunity to yeast. It might be the closest thing to a diagnosis out there other than the candia5 test. Another thing you could do is go to a GI doctor or allergist and get some of these test done (but at european labs): http://www.candidaplan.com/store/Candida-Testing/ The problem with these tests is the cost and you might need a combination of 2-3 of them for positive diagnosis. Additionally they may not be conclusive. -raster"

Your best bet might be to research Gastroenterologists and/or Infectious Disease specialists since they are typically more familiar with yeast. The internet is going to be your best tool to find a knowledgeable doctor. Also speak with people who may have similar issues, they might be able to recommend somebody. Being near Lisbon you have a good chance. I can browse some literature to see what I find but I don’t speak portuguese so my tools are limited. -D"

I think a hair analysis + matching symptoms + personal history should give you a good idea. -D Yep, this is the way to go. For anyone thinking that they might be mercury, lead, aluminum toxic etc. check out both of Andy Cutler’s books. As far as dealing with heavy metals specifically I don’t know of anyone more knowledgeable than him. His protocol has recovered and improved the health conditions of many. A lot of people have had their yeast/digestive issues go away after following his chelation protocol for a long enough period of time. His two books are “Amalgam Illness” and “Hair Test Interpretation.” Both can be found on amazon, although if you’re really strapped for cash here’s a torrent of his first book: http://kickass.to/andrew-hall-cutler-amalgam-illness-t6533350.html Check out the reviews on amazon if you want confirmation as to the quality of both books and for how grateful people are for his protocol. I’m currently chelating with a good amount of success. Lots of problems have cleared up and I continue to improve. I highly recommend investigating this avenue of treatment!"
10,Rabelais,73,"  Do not believe random reviews from random (and unknown!!!) users on Amazon. Sure, for ordinary books suchs reviews may be useful. But for medical books, especially those books that go against accepted medical knowledge, reviews are to be distrusted. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that many such books are published in order to earn money. Earning money, either directly through selling the books, or indirectly by making more people visit the author for a (paid!) consultation. The second reason is that people whose health happens to improve after following some of a book’s advice, tend to write a positive review, whereas those people who experience no change at all happen not to write anything. So, even if only 5% just happens to feel an improvement, they will write, and you’ll read nothing from the other 95%. This way, 100% of reviews will be positive – even if 95% of people experienced no improvement at all.     Then, of course, there’s the chelation issue. As you can read elsewhere on this forum, chelation has negative side effects. The chelation chemicals may even directly endanger your health. Chelation does have its uses, and that’s why hospitals do use it – but only after making sure that the advantages outweigh the impact on your health. Using chelation “just to try” is therefore very risky business. If your health is already compromised, you’d better steer away from such experiments. Rabelais  "
0,shroomy dophillus,74,"Yo! Introduction I’m a 27 year old Economics master student on my final year. I’ve never paid much attention to my health. Sort of had the “if it’s not broken, don’t fix it”  mentality. I’ve been smoking and drinking more than what is healthy ever since I turned 18.  Couple that with a shitty diet containing a lot of refined sugar, and you have me. Well, at least the old version of me. Diseases, signs & symptoms I’ve been having Pityrosporium Folliculitis (Malassezia) for at least 10 years, although I suspect longer. I haven’t had this documented by a dermatologist, but judging from my symptoms and rash I am 99% confident that this is what I have (Pityrosporium Folliculitis – it’s as if they used pictures of me, and wrote about my symptoms). White, acne-like pimples that release a clear liquid if I pop them on my stomach, over-arms, chest and neck. Moreover I get an insane itch after taking a hot shower, sauna or sweat a lot. I’ve also been plagued by athlete’s foot for more than 10 years as well. Lamisil applied topically would lessen the symptoms for a while, but it has always returned. Furthermore I’ve had dandruff for as long as I can remember, and also I have white thrush on my tongue. Just did the infamous spit-test this morning, and while I could post a picture, I just think it looks gross. Spore-like strings hanging down from the top of the water. However, the bumps on my belly, and the itch from showering or sweating was never enough alone for me to harass the doctors with it. Nor was the athlete’s foot (lamisil is sold over the counter without the need of a prescription) or thrush. I’ve also been having IBS-like symptoms, but since starting probiotics I have been consistent, plus I’ve even been able to drink coffee without exploding! Coffee used to be the equivalent of liquid black death to me, resulting in stomach cramps, diarrhea and sweating. After a trip to Thailand with my ex in january 2012, my ever-so-stable vitiligo (description here) became active again. I’ve always had this panda-like spot on my belly, but since Thailand it’s been spreading, and I’ve been getting new spots on my upper body, as well as some of my eyebrow being affected (it’s called leukotrichia when it affects hair). Tried a topical ointment containing tacrolimus (x%), didn’t help at all. I’ve also bought a narrowband UV-B lamp (~$800 on ebay), which I’m using in combination with PC-KUS. White eyebrows, while making me look like a wizard, just isn’t the look I want to sport at 27! Following a bad breakup and an intensive exchange semester in France this spring I developed alopecia areata (AA). Literally the day after our last exam we were having drinks at a club, when I headed out for a cigarette. When I got up and turned around one of the guys exclaimed “Shroomy Dophillus! What have you done to your hair?!” – they took a picture, and much to my dismay I got to see a completely bare white spot, the size of a coin, at the back of my head. I did what any man would have done, and ordered lots of shots, and just wanted to drink myself to death right there and then. The AA has since been spreading, I’ve lost ~50% of the hair on my scalp, I’ve got a couple spots in my beard and pubes, and I THINK I have a tiiiny spot in my left eyebrow to go with it. So far I spent 30 minutes convincing my GP to prescribe LDN (read about it here). Been on it for approximately 2 weeks. Not noticed any effect so far, it is a long-term treatment though, so I’m planning to stick with it for at least 6 months. I have also started a new and healthier lifestyle, involving quitting soda, not drinking as much as I used to, and incorporating multi-vitamins, fish oils, ashwaganda, gingko baloba and probiotics (Dr Ohirra’s). The whole patchy hair loss situation interferes tremendously with school, social life, sex life and basically everyday life, as it affects my self-esteem so much. Don’t really like showing off the leopard hairdo, so you won’t catch me without a beanie or caps of some sort these days. Hence, ever since getting AA I’ve been spending hours googling every single day, trying to find out why the hell my immune system hates me so much. After I stumbled upon information about candidiasis I’ve finally grown optimistic! I’m thinking this might very well be the link explaining both of my auto-immune diseases, and all of my candidiasis symptoms. Is it possible I could be onto something here..? How I’m going to get better E-mailed one of the few nutritionists in my town, and booked an appointment tuesday. Also have an appointment with a dermatologist in the middle of october (been waiting 2 months, my issues are “only cosmetic”, so I have zero priority). I also just got back from my GP. After explaining my theory he agreed to prescribe Diflucan (6x150mg), on paper for my recurring athlete’s foot. Popped one as soon as I got home, planning to take twice a week until I run out, and observe the effects. I’m planning to do the candida diet for the rest of my life, if that’s what it takes. Was thinking I’d start off with the detox, after consulting with the nutritionist. I’ve gone on a shopping spree on Iherb, below follows a list of supplements currently being shipped:  1) Now Foods, Organic, Fiber-3, Powder, 16 oz (454 g) 2) Yerba Prima, Great Plains Bentonite Detox, 32 fl oz (946 ml) 3) Now Foods, NAC, (N-Acetyl Cysteine), 600 mg, 100 Veggie Caps 4) Pure Essence, Candex, Yeast Management System, 120 Veggie Caps 5) Life Flo Health, Collective Wellbeing, Detox Soap, 5 oz (141 g) 6) Now Foods, Candida Support, Intestinal Health, 180 Veggie Caps 7) Now Foods, Gr8-Dophilus, 120 Vcaps Furthermore I plan to order: 8) Abkit, NatureWorks, Swedish Bitters, 8.45 fl oz (250 ml) 9) Now Foods, Silymarin, Milk Thistle Extract, 2X – 300 mg, 200 Veggie Caps 10) Now Foods, L-Glutamine, Double Strength, 1000 mg, 120 Capsules As well as the ones I’m currently taking: 11) Nature’s Way, Alive! Whole Food Energizer, Multi-Vitamin, Max Potency, No Iron Added, 180 Tablets 12) Now Foods, Ashwagandha, 450 mg, 90 Veggie Caps 13) Doctor’s Best, Extra Strength Ginkgo, 120 mg, 120 Veggie Caps 14) Natrol, Biotin, Maximum Strength, 10,000 mcg, 100 Tablets 15) Tran, a norwegian fish oil, rich in omega-3 and so on and so forth yada yada. So yeah… I can start my own pharmacy soon!  Amazing jokes aside, 1 & 2 from the list are to be used for a detox smoothie. 3 is to be used to lessen die-off symptoms. Apart from 5, which is a soap, all the other ones I plan to use continuously throughout my journey towards getting my hair back, my candida in check and feeling healthy. I do realize that with the kitchen sink approach I might not know what it is that has cured me, should I one day succeed in reclaiming my life back, but as of now I’d much rather just do whatever I believe could have an effect, and then eliminate supplements one by one afterwards. Thank you for reading, any and all response would be appreciated! TL;DR Hank Moody-esque (minus all the women) lifestyle up until recently, diagnosed with alopecia areata and vitiligo, suspicions of candidiasis and possible link between the auto-immune diseases and said candidiasis. Bought a ton of supplements. Seeing a nutritionist soon, and a dermatologist next month. -S"

I’ll certainly do the test diet first! However, I figured I could just start with a detox, seeing as you’re supposed to wait 8 days before starting the provocation tests either way. Also, I’m currently on Dr Ohirra’s probiotics, and waiting for a new (and a bit cheaper) one to arrive in the mail, it’s called Gr8-Dophilus by Now Foods. From the information I could gather online, diflucan/fluconazole is an even stronger anti-fungal than nystatin. Definitely not looking to approach this half-heartedly, and I sincerely doubt eating healthy food, in addition to anti-fungal supplements and various herbs could hurt my body more than my previous diet would have."
3,shroomy dophillus,74,"Tiny update: Been staying off gluten for the last week or so. Today after school I went to my mom’s and had dinner, thinking I’d be fine with lamb, cabbage and potatoes (a norwegian traditional dish). As she was making it she told me the secret was to add white flour, and asked me if I could have that. Weeeeeell, after thinking it through I decided what the hell, might as well try and see if I get a reaction from it. Got bloated pretty much instantly, and still am 3 hours later. A couple of years ago I did a blood sample, testing for celiac disease. Test came back negative, but after today I’m feeling pretty sure I should stay away from gluten. edit: come to think of it, the whole hairloss thing started on my 4th month in France, where I was eating crazy amounts of white baguettes. How I didn’t make this connection sooner is beyond me. Well, bye bye gluten!"

Back then, when i should have been a little, curious and funny guy, insted of this i was trapped in horror becouse of constant and very strong headaches, vomitting, feeling totally spaced out most of my childhood. There also was lot of days when i was pain-free, but it was a prrety much nightmare too, becouse i felt like it could begin any minute, and i dont even know why… I definetely remeber cravings for sugar, all the cookies, bread and etc..Once at a kirdergarted they called an ambulance, and in the hospital they told that they didnt found anything exept enlarged stomach acidity. But i dint give up back then, I felt like one pretty, sunny day I’am gonna make it, no matter what it takes to, becouse its like a life and death meatter . My mother didnt looked at my seriously ( i cannt tell how mad i am at her now ), and my father was never at home. As i attended school, my pains continuend to couse a hell for me up until 9th grade, when i started to smoke pot. After a little smoke of pot everythings seems so delicious, especially sugar. So two and a half years i smoked pot by daily bases and ate a lot of sugar every evening. I dint even noticed how i reached the hell, but after 2,5 years marijuana and sugar in daily bases i felt tottaly like i was in hell. I didnt understoood whats going on but i remeber very strong sugar cravings all the time and felling spaced out, depressed, I even tought i might be demon regarding to my hard past. When i stopped marijuana, and started reduce sugar (that was hard) i started to had constant stomach pain, bloating, constipation, sugar cravings. Now two years have gone and nothing changed. My constant abdominal pain and depression drives my crazy. I have been done endoscopy, blood, stools, sugar and sugar test. Everything seemed normal but they found a little blood in stools. She tought i had ibs, but still send my to the other hospital to do a coloscopy. I didnt go there becouse i dont have money, and i dont want to ask for, becouse evybody from my family thinks that i am crazy egoist, yah, pretty much that. So i recdently started research on the internet and i think i have ibs with candida. So as they advised i started to follow candida diet, after 5 days i felt significantly better, basically i never ever felt so good in my life but i broke,becouse there was no food i could eat, and i dont have my money to buy some, so started to eat sugar again. All the relief gone and now i am depressed spaced out, without a hope as i was previously. But now i know when ill have a job and my money, i will conquer my candida at any cost.  Basically i need to know does it sound like candida? And what could you advise to me in my case? I just need some hope that this is possiblle, to overcome this and finally feel freeee. Thanks."

1,lolcandida,77,"Low carb will never beat candida because candida can metabolize ketones. To beat candida you need to eat a decent amount of carbs to strengthen your adrenals as well as your bacteria which are the bodies main defense against candida overgrowth. All carbs are not the same, find the sources of carbohydrate that improves your condition and does not cause you problems. Most likely you will be able to tolerate one or more of: peeled potatoes, sweet potatoes, sprouted beans, possibly white rice, and any other source of starch that is mainly comprised of glucose as opposed to fructose. Begin by eating these sources without added fat and by themselves if your digestion is weak."

3,Walshh3,77,"Hi I’m new to this site and new to candida diet. I’m only on day 5 of the anti candida diet.  I’m taking activated charcoal to help with the die off symptoms. Maybe they could help you?  I’m also taking oregano oil as an fungal and just drinking lemon and ginger tea and chicory root instead of coffee. Yesterday was my first day of feeling good and I feel even better this morning. On tuesday I will start to introduce the probiotic. If die off symptoms are the issue I think the charcoal is great.  Also I am attending NAET (allergy elimination therapy) and it was here that I was diagnosed with systemic candida, which is in my brain/liver/large intestine/small intestine and uterus.  Naet would be great for you too, it identifies what you’re intolerant to and clears you!  Hope things get easier for you,  I’m still unsure how long I’ll have to do this for etc but the benefits are motivating me."
4,Angelreader,77,I am only just beginning to consider the candida diet as my first attempt’ some months ago lasted 48 hours. I’d never felt so unwell in my life and the thought of embarking again is already making me feel tearful. I don’t really know how to start.

About other’s I am just lowering my expectations about what I’ll get from them– I make a joke of nightshades and am now trying to explain Histamine– might as well just not expect people to understand. I remember when I did not understand. I was extremely healthy all my life until about 10 years ago. It was not until I suffered that I learned empathy for others and developed my own a strong interest physical health. I so relate to another posters fears and tears. I think gene wise I am very sensitive to pain – my twin is exactly the opposite! Maybe many folks here are extra sensitive to pain… But I think it is suffering for years that takes a toll, an emotional toll and just not wanting to suffer on top of suffering. But I do believe that perseverance and shaking off the emotion and cleaning out candida is my only option. Got to take responsibility mentally and spiritually. No more excuses like being distracted about the differing candida approaches and opinions. And all the food and supplement choices etc. I must learn to listen to my body, and keep claiming that I am fearfully and wonderfully made. No more just getting by and doing what is convenient. I only know one hope and it is Grace. I always failed on diets to lose weight… liked an old book called “Diets Don’t Work” by Bob Schwartz. But I read it back in 1996 along with so many more diet books and I still never lost weight. It was only the Grace of God that I lost 100 lbs and only the Grace of God that have kept it off for 4 years. Now it is Candida I need to lose. I pray you and the others here find ways to stay motivated and curtail the really bad die off symptoms."
0,mamasez,78,"Hey everybody.  I’m a mother of four small children, living in New Zealand.  My struggles with candida overgrowth and yeast infections began when I was first married, 7.5 years ago.  Since then, I’ve seen doctors, gynaecologists and homeopathic practitioners, with no success.  I’ve had yeast infections (‘down there’) for most of the time I’ve been married, it tends to come and go with flare-ups when I indulge in too much sugar, sickness, antibiotics etc. Since I’ve been pregnant or nursing pretty much for the last 7 years or so, it’s been really hard to try and get rid of the candida altogether. I have tried the Candida Diet before, several years ago when I had just the one toddler, was making good progress but then became pregnant again so had to abandon it. I have made adjustments to my diet so that now I eat low-sugar and low-wheat but have just had a hideous flare-up again so in desperation I’m turning to the Candida Diet on this website – think I’m ready to commit for good! Since this horrible thing has started to take over my life and affect my marriage (no ‘Quality Time’ with my husband because it is just too painful and itchy) I have decided I’m not going to let it beat me! I think it will be pretty hard because I’ve always loved food, baking and cooking, especially for my family, so this will require a bit of a mindset adjustment (to say the least). Oh and also, as to antifungals, a lot of the ones that are mentioned on this site are not available here, but I have found Kolorex cream and capsules (with the antifungal oil of native horopito) made in NZ are really good. 🙂 Sarah"

2,raster,78,"You can still bake and cook but you’ll just need to find new ingredients and recipes. There are tons of gluten free safe recipes for the diet, you just have to find them. Your family will likely like them too! -raster"
3,Paperstars,78,"You can definitely bake gluten-free. If you can tolerate teff flour than that flour is probably one of the best gluten-free flours resembling regular wheat flour with regards to helping the product ‘glue’ together. If you cannot have teff flour like me, you can try adding some rice bran or hemp protein into the gluten-free flour mix and the fiber will help attract the moisture and hold the product together. Xanthum gum or psyllium husk is also popular in the gluten-free community because without it, gluten free products tend to crumble, but I don’t think either of these two are good for people with leaky gut like me, so I like rice bran."
4,surfside949,78,"Hey there down under~ I am also fairly new to this and yet, have already learned so much!! Yes, I am seeing some positive results!! My feeling: The war on Candida is an overall extreme make-over of the body. In order to be effective, it is essential to use each product appropriately or it’s just a waste of time and money. For example; to achieve optimum results and benefits from a probiotic, it should be taken on an empty stomach and with nothing else. Anti-fungals interfere with their job and accordingly, in order for anti-fungals to work, you need to be taking a digestive enzyme. After all, our bodies played host to the “perfect storm” and provided the ideal setting for yeast overgrowth. Due to it’s mutation and ability to change, we have to go on the offensive and hit it on all fronts. I also wanted to mention, from what I understand: Men can also carry the Candida Albicans and perhaps you guys are passing it back and forth without really curing it??? I am not an expert but, you might want to study up and ask you Physican (specializing in Candida is best). Re; Herbal regiment: Based on documented research, in order to achieve a BALANCED EFFECTIVE herbal regiment, it should include first and foremost: DIGESTIVE ENZYMES. As well as… ANTI-FUNGALS, DETOX CLEANSERS FOR THE LIVER, PROBIOTICS and IMMUNE BOOSTERS. They all serve a specific purpose and when used correctly, they will combat the yeast by breaking down the cell walls and degrading its compounds. As you may have heard and seems to be controversial, the anti-fungals need to be rotated about every 10 days but, that’s seems to be something to do based on individual results. I found that it is also just as imperative that the “digestive enzymes” you purchase are the ones that actually combat “CANDIDA ALIBCANS.” DIgestive Enzyme product working great for me: “Candidase” with Cellulase & Proteases (there are others out there but, this one has had some awesome success) I am also dealing with vaginal issues and when selecting a probiotic, I am using one that also has targeted strains to rebuild vaginal environment. “Vagcare” is a raw probiotic with 50 billion live cultures and 38 strains. Depending what your local health food store offers, you should be able to find something that will target this issue. This product will also help to re-establish intestinal tract but, has more specific strains specific to our need. Cheers to your health and you will find lots of fabulous information on this forum. Also, just in case you want to reach out, I found a couple Candida BLOGS if you want to utilize additional resources… perhaps you might find someone near you that can help with purchasing herbal remedies locally and if not, you should be able to buy most products on line. Best of luck & cheer to your health! Mess at the beach~"

I feel like he needs to rest now and just do the diet but we are very new at this .

3,raster,79,"Ya you guys overdid it. I recommend liver cleansing and some of the detox stuff mentioned in that post. One way he can feel better immediately is if he did some acupuncture, hot springs, or sweating out the toxins by doing hot tub/sauna/jacuzzi/steam room, etc. I wouldn’t consume more than 1-3 tsb of coconut oil starting out per day. I would get some food into him like pumpkin (which is a really good detoxing food). Soups are another thing to look into. Tons of veggies too. When he is ready, he can heal faster by giving his digestive system a break by eating smoothies, etc. That might be overdoing it right now though. -raster"
0,nicole13,80,"This is my first day back on the cleanse/diet in over a year. I honestly don’t remember being this HUNGRY the first time around. I’ve already found myself thinking…”how in the hell did I go two months eating like this before?” I am writing this while I choke down my green smoothie consisting of swiss chard, cucumber, lemon, and ginger. YUMMY!Not even seven hours in and I have already had a fiber and bentonite shake, two cucumber, two bowls of steamed veggies with avocado, a green smoothie, and about 50 ounces of water. The hunger is REAL! Not going to lie I’m already craving fruit but I will NOT give in. I’m wondering how many people spend the first days of this cleanse shoveling greens in their mouth. I have a feeling I will be paying for this tomorrow if you know what I mean. So far I’ve only experienced a mild headache on and off. I assume the rest of my day will consist of more steamed veggies, water, and another bentonite shake along with the recommended liver flush. BLEH! Enough of my mindless ranting.

2,gladsome,80,"Hi Nicole, I began my diet 2 weeks ago, leaving the health food store (after spending a bundle), ripping open a package of dried seaweed. At the time I thought it was the most delicious thing in the world because I felt like I was starving. So, I can relate. I found a good recipe for almond muffins on Elana’s Pantry that satisfy. I think they are gluten free only and call for honey (if I remember correctly), but I just put stevia in instead. I also love her avocado dressing for my salads. SO much better than just vinegar and oil. I have even put it on my chicken and broccoli at dinner. Even my husband likes it. I am quite sure it is OK, and you may have to test it first, but my favorite smoothie is a must for me in order to make it through the afternoon. It is simple. One scoop of NOW egg white protein powder [eggwhite powder (Instantized), Xylitol, Natural Vanilla Flavors, BetterStevia, Natural Citrus Flavor and Soy Lecithin (<1%)] with one cup of Living Harvest unsweetened vanilla hempmilk, 3-4 drops of stevia, and as much ice as you like. Put in the blender and enjoy! I use the hempmilk just for the smoothies, because it has more fat (8g) than my coconut milk and that makes the smoothies better. I have made some recipes that went in the waste basket. I have never been much for cooking and baking (so no surprise to me that I finally have to pay the Piper!), but I am learning now. I am trying and spend a little time every day researching or trying a new recipe. Oh yes, almond crackers. Also I believe on Elana’s website. I think almond flour will be my lifesaver…along with avocados! I hope this helps. God bless!"

A lot of people also refer to the candida5 test, which can be done by yourself. It’s nice to have some confirmation, but don’t get your hopes too high.

There is no such thing as a quick fix for a candida overgrowth. That’s why I’m against the use of pharmaceutical antifungals. Candida is a chronic disease and it should be treated that way. You should try some natural antifungals like caprylic acid, extra virgin coconut oil, oregano oil and red thyme. Caprylic acid and oregano oil are good antifungals to start with. Antifungals will not cure candida. It will only be able to keep it at bay.Alexisrichardss;58692 wrote: And, is it possible to have a mild form of candida?

0,Jaredxtr,83,"Hello All, Background Last November I began feeling a strange sensation of what felt like a rod stuck in my penis. I could feel pain spread to my groin, testicles, pubic region and lower abdomen as days went on. I also noticed my semen was very stringy, noodle-like, and thick. It was almost like there was a blockage and my semen took a couple extra seconds to come out. I also noticed my symptoms would get worse after I peed. Peeing itself felt fine but the five minutes after were the worst. I wouldn’t classify the pain as severe or even burning at all- just uncomfortable. I went to the doctor and he immediately said I had chlamydia or gonorrhea (based on my sexual history this was unlikely). I got tested for both and UTI (twice for my own piece of mind) and everything came out negative. The doctor suspected it was prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 10-days then 30-days. I responded extremely well to antibiotics experiencing almost no symptoms after 48-hours. However towards the end of my treatment I felt the same symptoms coming back. I went for a second opinion and the new doctor checked my prostate, visually inspected me for a hernia or any other STD’s, had me do an ultra-sound (kidneys), and sent me for PSA tests- once again everything good. He put me on short stints of Vibramycin and Flagyl to see how I would react. I reacted positively however not as good as the initial Cipro. He referred me to a specialist who I don’t see for another 6 months (God Bless Canada’s Health Care haha). I continued to experience symptoms however what’s strange is that my symptoms became limited to this slight and uncomfortable pain in my urethra (no spreading to the groin, pubic region, or testicles). I began experiencing new symptoms (likely as a result of my antibiotics). I am unsure what symptoms are from the initial illness, the antibiotics, or both. Moreover, I hadn’t even heard of Candida overgrowth until recently and wasn’t looking for other symptoms. In my defense I thought this was case closed after I responded so positively to Cipro. I went to go see a natural path and told her this and the new symptoms (which are below). She said, with pretty good confidence, that she believes I have textbook case of Candida overgrowth. She also said that it may have at one point been bacterial based (hence my positive response to antibiotics) but is Candida based now. She also brought up a good point in that when I was on antibiotics I wasn’t consuming/consuming small amounts of alcohol. I want to be very detailed so that anybody with a similar situation can relate. This has been one of the most mind-bending few months I’ve ever experienced but feel like I’m on the “up n’ up”. This site has been a god sent and I’m committed to contributing back in any way that I can. If anybody has any questions please feel free to post. I’m smart phone enabled with email notifications so can respond shortly. I can only provide insights on my experiences and I am in no way a substitution for a trained medical expert. There’s also a lot I’m still trying to figure out on my own which I’ve highlighted in RED. Symptoms November/December – Slight discomfort in urethra (very mild) – Aching groin (mild) – Pain in pubic bone (medium)  – Sore testicles (medium) – Stringy, thick, noodle-like semen (off and on, worse on days when symptoms bad) – Low libido – No discharge – No blood in urine or stool – Symptoms come and go in strength but are always “there” Note: Antibiotics taken in December and January. January/February/March – Slight discomfort in urethra (very mild, more sporadic) – Aching groin (extremely mild, and very sporadic) – Stringy, thick, noodle-like semen (off and on, worse on days when symptoms bad) – Low libido – No discharge – No blood in urine or stool – Symptoms come and go – Athletes foot – Itchy anus (and I mean itchy) – Jock itch – Weird almost “film” like layer over head of penis. It’s most noticeable after I cum and the erection is dieing.  – Very subtle white “blotches” on head of penis when I have an erection. Almost looks like its dry skin or something. I’ve heard this can be the yeast (also it doesn’t happen all the time). – Erections take longer to get, and die quick (almost like I have to really focus haha. – Foggy head – Random sweating episodes. I’d have sweating arm pits almost constantly – Extremely gassy, almost like clockwork every afternoon Other Notes of Interest – In March, I read up on the Spit Test (look this up if you don’t know what I mean) and failed it miserably. – In November, this started on a Monday. The Friday before launched the start of an incredibly stressful relationship situation. – My current stress level is very very high. I’m moving cities, switching jobs, aforementioned relationship mess, etc. – Out of complete blind-luck (once again, I had no idea Candida existed) I discovered that White Rice (sushi), alcohol (especially beer), sugar, and poor sleep were aggravators whereas Garlic, Vitamin C, and pure homemade juices were relievers. (Note: at night I would eat a raw clove of garlic and would be symptom free within five minutes and it usually bought me an hour).  – I’m not circumcised – Generally very healthy. Run about 120km/mo, before diet the Candida diet I would drink 4-6 drinks per week, rarely eat fast food.  – The Candida Diet sucks. There’s no two-ways around it, but it wasn’t a crazy adjustment for me as my diet is already quite healthy so my progression might be quicker than others. – I have not had sex since this started (no coming off the bench until I’m 100%) Because of the long-wait to see the specialist I booked an appointment with a Natural Path. She put me on the Candida Diet (almost verbatim to what’s on this site) plus extra strong probiotics. I’ve also been eating about 3 cups of 0% Organic Plain Probiotic Yogurt (Is this okay? It says there’s 12g of sugar/serving but I can’t get any better than this stuff?) its been 10 days of 100% strict and here’s what I’ve experienced: Day 1: Almost no change, kind of felt the same Day 2: Symptom of rod in penis felt worse than ever and felt hung-over (die-off). Craved sugar and carbs like crazy, was super irritable, couldn’t focus, just wanted to sleep, depressed, low energy. Day 3: Same as Day 2 Day 4-5: Symptoms marginally better, hung-over feeling subsided. Athletes foot began to go away, jock itch went away, no more afternoon gas, became EXTREMELY regular in my bowel movements (almost to the half hour every day). However still had feeling of pain in urethra (but definitely better). I also noticed a slight rash on the head of my penis (very similar to athlete’s foot) but then it went away after a day or so. Day 5-Day 10: Same as above however noticed that the pain in the urethra is very specific to after I pee. About 5 mins after I pee it kicks up, then goes away (any thoughts?) Overall Notes from Diet – I’m 5’11 and 167 lbs and fell to 159 lbs after about 10 days – Notice my veins are really visible in arms and legs (this could be completely unrelated) but I’m a fan. Makes me look way tougher than I am. – Feel very “calm”. I find I don’t react too high or too low to things. I just kind of take them as they come in this stressful time in my life (which is NOT my character whatsoever).  – Sleeping way better. I rarely take longer than 15 mins to get to sleep – Tip: Make sure you get Pure Organic Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar. Not only do I find I respond better to it, but it tastes way better (I crave it now). I have purchased Canestan however was told not to take the tablet until two-weeks in. I have however been using the cream. I just rub it on the head of my penis at night, role my foreskin up, and wash it off in the morning. I have found this does provide a great deal of relief. I also use Gold Bond powder every morning all in my crotch region. I don’t know if this even makes a difference but I feel like it helps. The Questions I Have 1. Green Tea, yay or nay? I’ve read caffeine is a no-no but I’ve also heard Green Tea can be super powerful. 2. Almonds? I’ve heard nuts are bad but almonds are okay, thoughts? 3. I’ve noticed that my primary symptom of the rod in penis/inflamed urethra feeling is worse if I don’t ejaculate for a couple of days. Then when I do it’s almost like instant relief. Does anybody have any insight on that? I’ve read Tartaric Acid is emitted from yeast. I’m not sure if that’s in my urine that’s causing the pain after peeing or something in the pre-cum or semen kills the fungal growth? 4. Is this a back and forth battle or is it sudden death (figure of speech)? What I’m asking is that if I slip up and have a piece of bread of a beer does that mean I have prolonged my recovery in that the Candida gains some power, but I’m still winning or should I essentially start from square one, in that one beer is all Candida needs to come back in full force. Once again, I hope this provides value for anybody who is going through something similar. I’ve gone from thinking I had an STD, to potentially prostate cancer, to Candida and finally am feeling better. Any insights, criticisms, questions, and answers are welcome!

1,Able900,83,"In March, I read up on the Spit Test (look this up if you don’t know what I mean) and failed it miserably.

That depends on your particular infestation. “Cheating” on the diet with such foods can set you back a couple of days or more; but I’ve also seen sufferers go back to square one because of the heavy increase in symptoms.

2,usedhplc,83,My first journey was i do not remember.My Mom told me that i was first went with my mom to mom’s mom house in Texas..
3,raster,83,"One thing I would consider doing is testing your liver to see whether it is damaged or not. I had UTI like burning after ejaculating and urinating a few months ago and then it went away as quickly as it came. I did some testing at that time and learned my liver was slightly damaged. Once I started to heal my liver, my symptoms improved. Beer is just about the worst thing you could have; I wouldn’t plan on drinking for a long time. I haven’t drank for about 14 months myself. If you do drink, beer/wine is the worse and potato vodka is the best. I would not start to cheat on the diet until you are nearly symptom free. I wish you luck on the diet! We have a very strict forum diet if you are interested (email able900) where we don’t even eat rice or nuts. -raster"
4,addyroo6,83,"Wow. Your story is very similar to mine: I was sick this winter for 2 1/2 months straight (probably because I work in a restaurant where I’m exposed to lots of people and their ailments). After I was feeling better, I went out for New Year’s Eve, and the next day had the worst hangover of my life! That’s when the burning penis sensation started. Just as Jaredxtr described, it felt like a rod had been inserted in my urethra, and the pain extended down the shaft, especially when I had an erection, and the burning during urination was terrible. I went to Planned Parenthood, and they gave me a one dose antibiotic because they thought I had the clap. It seemed to clear up briefly, but then my anus became extremely itchy. This symptom was by far the worst, and most difficult to deal with. My girlfriend told me I might have a yeast infection and/or UTI, so I started taking an hearbal anti-yeast supplement, that contained grapefruit seed extract, and some other beneficial herbs. It helped, but the pain came back as soon as I went through the bottle, and it never fully went away. I was NOT on the diet at that point, and in looking back, the supplement did not contain a very strong dosage. Eventually I found my way to the Candida Diet website, and ultimately this forum. I’ve been on Able and Raster’s strict diet for 2 weeks or so, and a less strict version for 2 months before that (the Candida Diet Website’s version). I’ve been rotating anti-fungals (Oregano Oil, Grapefruit Seed Extract, Liquid Black Walnut/Wormwood Complex) every 2 weeks along with daily consumption of raw garlic and coconut oil, and taking MegaFlora probiotics for the last few weeks. Last week I started making my own Kefir at home with an “heirloom variety” of Kefir grain that I purchased from a goat farmer in Ohio. The homemade Kefir has helped my energy immensely, and I think it may be the missing link for my full recovery! *A quick note on the term “Heirloom Variety” for Kefir Grains: Apparently commercial yogurts, kefirs, kombuchas, etc. use just a few isolated probiotics in their products, so that the products stay more consistent in large batches. Heirloom varieties of kefir grains, kombucha mothers, yogurt starters, etc. are varieties that have been kept alive over many years of fermentation (in most cases centuries of fermentation!) and passed down from person to person. These varieties have much more complex probiotics and more powerful health benefits than those found on the shelves in grocery stores. If anyone is interested in the specifics of the various fermentation processes, check out Sandor Ellix Katz’s website: http://www.wildfermentation.com He has a couple books with a wealth of information on fermentation, which is very helpful if people would like to incorporate fermented foods into their diet permanently. There is also a great website on making Kefir by an Australian man named Dom: Dom’s Kefir Page For the last few weeks, I haven’t experienced any symptoms except lethargy (from die-off I suppose) and a mild burning sensation at the tip of my urethra. I have felt a little more like myself lately, which is awesome, but I haven’t kicked the Candida just yet, it seems. The thing I can’t figure out is how this happened to me. I very rarely ate anything with sugar in it. I ate a diet that mainly consisted of whole, organic foods, including pastured organic eggs, meat and yogurt, and home-made kombucha and Kimchi. I drank good quality beer, wine, and liquor a couple times a week, and I’ve always been active, and gotten plenty of exercise and sleep. The only thing I can think of is stress. I’ve had a very stressful few years, and I’ve probably been drinking too much coffee, which I’m sure didn’t help. But honestly I don’t see any obvious connections, other than stress and 2 straight months of being sick (weakened immune system). I’m really hoping this doesn’t come back to haunt me someday after I’ve fully reintroduced fruits, cheeses, and starchy vegetables. Thank you Jaredxtr for sharing your story. It’s great to have solidarity. I think it is really important to see the differences in how this condition affects different people, but it’s especially important to see people going through the exact same thing, and see signs of improvement, so we can all have hope for the future."
5,paulkur89234,83,It’s just so good to see people in my same boat. I feel like I’m not alone experiencing the same thing.
6,gv,83,"Jaredxtr;18704 wrote: Hello All, Background Last November I began feeling a strange sensation of what felt like a rod stuck in my penis. I could feel pain spread to my groin, testicles, pubic region and lower abdomen as days went on. I also noticed my semen was very stringy, noodle-like, and thick. It was almost like there was a blockage and my semen took a couple extra seconds to come out. I also noticed my symptoms would get worse after I peed. Peeing itself felt fine but the five minutes after were the worst. I wouldn’t classify the pain as severe or even burning at all- just uncomfortable. I went to the doctor and he immediately said I had chlamydia or gonorrhea (based on my sexual history this was unlikely). I got tested for both and UTI (twice for my own piece of mind) and everything came out negative. The doctor suspected it was prostatitis and put me on Cipro for 10-days then 30-days. I responded extremely well to antibiotics experiencing almost no symptoms after 48-hours. However towards the end of my treatment I felt the same symptoms coming back. I went for a second opinion and the new doctor checked my prostate, visually inspected me for a hernia or any other STD’s, had me do an ultra-sound (kidneys), and sent me for PSA tests- once again everything good. He put me on short stints of Vibramycin and Flagyl to see how I would react. I reacted positively however not as good as the initial Cipro. He referred me to a specialist who I don’t see for another 6 months (God Bless Canada’s Health Care haha). I continued to experience symptoms however what’s strange is that my symptoms became limited to this slight and uncomfortable pain in my urethra (no spreading to the groin, pubic region, or testicles). I began experiencing new symptoms (likely as a result of my antibiotics). I am unsure what symptoms are from the initial illness, the antibiotics, or both. Moreover, I hadn’t even heard of Candida overgrowth until recently and wasn’t looking for other symptoms. In my defense I thought this was case closed after I responded so positively to Cipro. I went to go see a natural path and told her this and the new symptoms (which are below). She said, with pretty good confidence, that she believes I have textbook case of Candida overgrowth. She also said that it may have at one point been bacterial based (hence my positive response to antibiotics) but is Candida based now. She also brought up a good point in that when I was on antibiotics I wasn’t consuming/consuming small amounts of alcohol. I want to be very detailed so that anybody with a similar situation can relate. This has been one of the most mind-bending few months I’ve ever experienced but feel like I’m on the “up n’ up”. This site has been a god sent and I’m committed to contributing back in any way that I can. If anybody has any questions please feel free to post. I’m smart phone enabled with email notifications so can respond shortly. I can only provide insights on my experiences and I am in no way a substitution for a trained medical expert. There’s also a lot I’m still trying to figure out on my own which I’ve highlighted in RED. Symptoms November/December – Slight discomfort in urethra (very mild) – Aching groin (mild) – Pain in pubic bone (medium)  – Sore testicles (medium) – Stringy, thick, noodle-like semen (off and on, worse on days when symptoms bad) – Low libido – No discharge – No blood in urine or stool – Symptoms come and go in strength but are always “there” Note: Antibiotics taken in December and January. January/February/March – Slight discomfort in urethra (very mild, more sporadic) – Aching groin (extremely mild, and very sporadic) – Stringy, thick, noodle-like semen (off and on, worse on days when symptoms bad) – Low libido – No discharge – No blood in urine or stool – Symptoms come and go – Athletes foot – Itchy anus (and I mean itchy) – Jock itch – Weird almost “film” like layer over head of penis. It’s most noticeable after I cum and the erection is dieing.  – Very subtle white “blotches” on head of penis when I have an erection. Almost looks like its dry skin or something. I’ve heard this can be the yeast (also it doesn’t happen all the time). – Erections take longer to get, and die quick (almost like I have to really focus haha. – Foggy head – Random sweating episodes. I’d have sweating arm pits almost constantly – Extremely gassy, almost like clockwork every afternoon Other Notes of Interest – In March, I read up on the Spit Test (look this up if you don’t know what I mean) and failed it miserably. – In November, this started on a Monday. The Friday before launched the start of an incredibly stressful relationship situation. – My current stress level is very very high. I’m moving cities, switching jobs, aforementioned relationship mess, etc. – Out of complete blind-luck (once again, I had no idea Candida existed) I discovered that White Rice (sushi), alcohol (especially beer), sugar, and poor sleep were aggravators whereas Garlic, Vitamin C, and pure homemade juices were relievers. (Note: at night I would eat a raw clove of garlic and would be symptom free within five minutes and it usually bought me an hour).  – I’m not circumcised – Generally very healthy. Run about 120km/mo, before diet the Candida diet I would drink 4-6 drinks per week, rarely eat fast food.  – The Candida Diet sucks. There’s no two-ways around it, but it wasn’t a crazy adjustment for me as my diet is already quite healthy so my progression might be quicker than others. – I have not had sex since this started (no coming off the bench until I’m 100%) Because of the long-wait to see the specialist I booked an appointment with a Natural Path. She put me on the Candida Diet (almost verbatim to what’s on this site) plus extra strong probiotics. I’ve also been eating about 3 cups of 0% Organic Plain Probiotic Yogurt (Is this okay? It says there’s 12g of sugar/serving but I can’t get any better than this stuff?) its been 10 days of 100% strict and here’s what I’ve experienced: Day 1: Almost no change, kind of felt the same Day 2: Symptom of rod in penis felt worse than ever and felt hung-over (die-off). Craved sugar and carbs like crazy, was super irritable, couldn’t focus, just wanted to sleep, depressed, low energy. Day 3: Same as Day 2 Day 4-5: Symptoms marginally better, hung-over feeling subsided. Athletes foot began to go away, jock itch went away, no more afternoon gas, became EXTREMELY regular in my bowel movements (almost to the half hour every day). However still had feeling of pain in urethra (but definitely better). I also noticed a slight rash on the head of my penis (very similar to athlete’s foot) but then it went away after a day or so. Day 5-Day 10: Same as above however noticed that the pain in the urethra is very specific to after I pee. About 5 mins after I pee it kicks up, then goes away (any thoughts?) Overall Notes from Diet – I’m 5’11 and 167 lbs and fell to 159 lbs after about 10 days – Notice my veins are really visible in arms and legs (this could be completely unrelated) but I’m a fan. Makes me look way tougher than I am. – Feel very “calm”. I find I don’t react too high or too low to things. I just kind of take them as they come in this stressful time in my life (which is NOT my character whatsoever).  – Sleeping way better. I rarely take longer than 15 mins to get to sleep – Tip: Make sure you get Pure Organic Unfiltered Apple Cider Vinegar.

I went from an perfectly healthy young man with unlimited energy to acquiring 30+ health conditions in a matter of months. To top that off, I could relate to nobody and doctors told me I was too young to have so many health problems and my IBS was likely due to stress and I was to just live with it. I have been through so much pain, depression, misery, loneliness, and suffering with this condition it nearly killed me.  It wasn’t until I starting reading the books and literature on this disease, reading works of doctors, microbiologists, toxicologist, stories of those who are suffering, and the cure stories did I find a path to getting better. Coffee is not an issue for most people, myself included. There was a time when used to believe most of the misinformation and myths of this syndrome, it only made my health decline faster. What are your symptoms and whats your health history? We will try to help. -D"
2,Lora Jayne,84,"Thank you so much Danny. Appreciate you sharing your story. I’m sorry you’ve had to struggle with this all as I have. I dealt with IBS as well as stomach ulcers AND gal stones… It took years to get to where I am today. In that sense I should be thankful.. That they narrowed my problems down to candidiasis and celiac disease. As far as my past health history…My mental health issues started at age 10. Anxiety, OCD, depression and paranoia. Then at age 15 the physical health issues started. It started by getting mono. Then things like the flu, fevers, and every single sickness you can imagine. It ranged from ear infections to pink eye, CONSTANTLY. And then at age 20 I had extreme iron deficiency and had to take iron shots. Granted, I didn’t eat healthy… And after getting mono the 2nd time, I was just DONE with life. My depression was worse than ever and so was my anxiety. So was my health. But I also started to wonder if food could have been the problem all along. So even though I hated my life and part of me didn’t care, I started to see a homeopathic doctor that a friend recommended to me, in order to get a different point of view. That’s where I discovered I had candidiasis as well as celiac disease. It was a relief to get diagnosed with those at the time, because I thought i’d get better once I ate the right things. And in some ways, it HAS gotten better and i’ve seen how i’ve healed. I lost 20 lbs and am now at a healthy weight, my skin cleared up, and i don’t have itchy skin anymore or as many yeast infections. My ears don’t ring anymore, (candida symptom i experienced frequently) and my muscles don’t constantly ache at night. I had every candida symptom you can imagine…And although a lot of the bad symptoms have gone away, i can never get the “spacey/foggy brained” feeling to go away…. Or the extreme fatigue… I have read a TON on it, and that does help. As well as seeing these stories on this website… But what frustrates me is this.. What treatment do I know to take? I know diet alone can’t do it.. I’ve not only heard doctors say that, but i’ve experienced a diet alone, not being able to cure it… But everyone says something different as far as treatment… Right now i’m on candex and a pro biotic.. As well as the vitamins C,D, fish oil and garlic. I also take apple cider vinegar and coconut oil daily. Money is very limited so I can’t afford much more. Is there anything else you’d suggest? Seems like you’ve come further than I have. What treatment did you use? And how do I have hope during detox? It’s good to hear that about coffee…. I cut off of it worrying it was effecting the yeast, but honestly, I AT LEAST need my cup of coffee! I’ve been cranky without it. I will try doing a cup a day again, but continuing to detox with other foods and such. Thank you again. Sorry this post is so long. PS: Also, I know this is gross. But does anyone know why there are specks of white in my urine? Everytime i get a urine sample the doctor just says it’s excess yeast… But does that mean it is leaving my system or that it’s taking over again??"
0,Riti,85,"Hi Everyone I’ m 25 years old and Back in November 2013 I got really sick… flu,ear infection etc..for this reason I was prescribed different antibiotics. The doctor asked me if I had a yeast infection before as from all the antibiotics he gave there could be a reaction. I said no so he told me to get some probiotics small dosage. I got better but I got a huge yeast infection. 5 months later and the infection doesn’t want to go away! The itching is the worse part! I went to my gyno and she prescribed pills and creams. I had to go back there 5 times in total and i never got any better. to make things worse it was around christmas time.. I ate a lot of sugary stuff around that time… I researched online about candida diets and found Lisa Richards books. I’ve been following her diet for 50 days! Eating the right food (i hope) and taking probiotics and anti fungals. Do you have any suggestions that can help me ? I can use all the help that I can get! When I read her book it said that after 60 days I can start re introducing food but the way I’m going I don’t think that I’ll be able to re introduce food for at least another 6 months!!! I’ m feeling very discouraged at the moment. I’ll be going on vacation in a few weeks, what am I going to do than?? I am not going to be able to follow this diet! If someone has similar stories please share  or any suggestions! Thanks in advance!!!"
1,raster,85,List the supplements and diet please… -raster
2,Riti,85,I started the diet with one week of detox. Eating vegetables the whole week and taking NAC. The second week I started eating organic meat. Mostly chicken because I read that you should avoid red meat. I do eat other stuff but all recipes from Lisa richards book that are ok for the candida diet. I started taking probiotics too. The third week I started taking the anti fungals. I take these at least two hours after taking the probiotics. I take Candida Support and Caprylic Acid. Thanks!!!
3,raster,85,"I recommend an anti-inflammatory diet and/or one that involves taking fatty acids (also known as biofilm protocol) that will slowly erode the candida down. I also recommend getting strict with the diet and reduce starchy items like rice and reduce red meat consumption. Certain food items might be problematic for you such as eggs and you might not know it, so I recommend testing each food you are eating in your diet for a week to see whether its a problem for you or not. Caprylic acid will only be effective for 6 weeks, so I recommend rotating to another antifungal at that point. I would try SF722 as a potential replacement. Also for probiotics, the best one I tried was HMF neuro which is the only human derived probiotic on the market. I rotate HMF neuro with other high count high strain probiotics. You also don’t have a detox plan it seems and if you don’t, then the yeast toxins will remain in the body causing problems. I recommend taking liver cleansing herbs that will aid in your detox. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9434_Die-off-remedies-post–will-edit-more-in-time.aspx http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst3698_Biofilms–Possible-protocol-for-a-faster-recovery.aspx?= -raster"
4,glen,85,"CANDIDA FREE AT LAST!! I TRY EVERYTHING THAT CAME IN THE MARKET PILLS DIET ,COLONICS MEDICINE… FOR AT LIST 15 YEARS. All came with horrible died off very sick for weeks thinking always that these time I am going to be Healthy at last. But always come back. These days I was reading about Archangels that they are always there for help if we call, and mention that Archangel Raphael is for medicine. So I ask him for guidance. Now I am CANDIDA FREE. I am going to share with you. I boil a cup of water ad 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon let rest 10 minutes. Sieved with a colander ,I ad 1 teaspoon of raw honey MUST BE RAW.(do not put the honey in boiling wait always to be warm). I drink 1 cup in the morning with empty stomach 30 minutes before Breakfast , and prepared another one before to go to bed always with empty stomach.Also I start to have fruit like pineapple that the Doctors o The MENs in Candida say no fruit. My stomach started to move a little more than usual but from the start of the colon, much better than colonics to me. I start filling the difference in a few days. Because my case was very severe once or twice a day I will have a glass of water with 1 tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar. 1 capsule grapefruit seed after lunch and one after dinner. “IN a WEEK I am CANDIDA FREE”. No one told me that all that I need was a GOOD STOMACH CLEANING. YUST FOR SAFETY CONSULT YOUR DOCTOR FIRST. IF YOU HEAL THANK ARCHANGEL RAFAEL.(i am not religious only believe in one GOD and now in His Helpers.)"
5,Rabelais,85,"  Honey is almost pure sugar. If I am to believe what many contributors to this forum say, sugar is the stuff from hell and candida thrives on sugar. Looking at it from that perspective, it’s amazing that a regular intake of honey has cured you. On the other hand, bees ad lots of antifungals to honey. They have to, because if they didn’t their entire beehive would soon be covered in mold and fungus. So obviously, observing that beehives are free from mold and fungus, the antifungal properties of honey are stronger than its fungus-feeding properties. Should the guidelines perhaps be altered? Maybe we should advise: do not consume sugar, unless it is from unprocessed honey. Anyone else have similar experiences with honey? Or perhaps contradicting experiences? I find this quite interesting. Rabelais  "
6,glen,85," I do not think that was the honey alone that cure me, I think was the combination of the honey with the cinnamon that help me to eliminate the waste that was building up for so many years in my digestive tract. I try so many laxatives all these years, I even have colonics that some how help me but not cure me. Let me tell you some hard black staff came from my colon, an after that I start to fill much better. Now I eat regular diet except sugar. I stop the grapefruit seed pills that make me headache. I do not understand that so many pills for candida in the market that on top that make you feel more seek , waists your money and not cure you. If your stomach is not clean and they give you on top staff that make you more seek it weaken your immune system,all your organs suffer ,special your liver,and with time you only get worst."
0,sauce,86,"It all started in summer of 2010 — I was away on vacation in Tennessee to visit my brother, and after a night of eating tons of carbs and drinking alcohol, I went into a panic attack. I thought it was from withdrawal from marijuana (which I was used to smoking at the time), but this attack was crazy. Anytime I would eat anything, it would send me into a crazy attack. My adrenals must have been super exhausted by the time I got home. I was prescribed Xanax and that was that. I tried switching my diet to a “healthy” diet, but nothing really seemed to work. Eventually, I found that fasting and removing alcohol completely made me feel tons better. I thought I had been cured. This lasted for nearly a year. The very next summer, the same panic happened — after drinking alcohol and eating very poorly for a long time (you thought I would have learned my lesson). I changed my diet again, eating celery and peanut butter, and eggs. Things started to get better. A beer would send me into a full-blown episode. Fast forward to a month ago. I had been drinking nightly for nearly 3 weeks due to a breakup, and was again eating sugary junk. Boom, major hypoglycemic episode. On top of this, my stomach was churning and it felt like I was having major IBS. I had done some research and found out about hypoglycemia and the symptoms, and they absolutely matched mine to the T. I went to doc the last week, and she did a glucose tolerance test. Sure enough, my blood sugar dropped to 48 after two hours. Reactive hypoglycemia. Over the last week, I have entertained the idea that I have candida, but was uncertain, so I decided to make a food journal. Even on the ketogenic diet, I’ve had issues with some of the items I’ve been eating. I ate some raw cashews last night and felt like hell, even though they were recommended. I ate a slice of cheese today (just as a test) and again could feel my stomach cramping and churning. It’s only when I’m eating low-glycemic vegetables, fresh eggs, and pasture-raised meats that I feel fine after meals. I’ve steadily started incorporating coconut oil (two tablespoons a day) and probiotics over the last week. Good news is, my poops have returned to their normal color, and my gut is feeling much better overall! After noticing that a general ketogenic diet does not help, I have decided to take on the candida diet. So far, it’s working. My hypoglycemic episodes are gone as of today, and my adrenals feel like they can finally start healing. I plan to follow this forum until I’ve conquered the candida, and my adrenal fatigue — I shall be victorious."
1,stitcherman,86,For most of my life there was so much enjoyment in a few beers after a days work. Those days are done after a few beers for a couple days do I ever pay! I have been sharing symptoms with doctors for years & they never mentioned candida. When I started to look into candida it was like throwing a jigsaw puzzle up in the air & having it land fully assembled. I have finally put the pieces together! So many symptoms all together. Candida it is.
0,AngelaL,87,"Well I’ve just entered my 7th week on the LR diet and it was all going pretty well but now I’ve reached a stage where I crave carbs constantly. I woke up today ravenously hungry and even my usual protein shake couldn’t satisfy me. I feel utterly disgusted at the thought of eating meat or eggs and I don’t want to eat a single vegetable ever again. I made some almond flour bread and even though it’s a bit dry, I’m more or less surviving on this for the time being – well until I get round to making some almond flour cake. Anyone else reached this stage and did you ever get past it?"
1,raster,87,You need carbs on the diet and you shouldn’t fear them at all…this isn’t a no carb diet. -raster

I asked him because We were maybe going to have sex..He then asked to see my tounge and said mine had white on it I said yea I hope it’s not yeast.. And I never told him then that I thought he had a yeast infection but I was thinking he did! Well he flipped out at me and yelled at me that he was grossed out that he never wanted to talk to me again and that I am a disgusting person. He said I told him I have a yeast infection… I said no, I said that you have a yeast infection!"

0,jotun,89,"Hello everyone, I have been suffering from ‘something’ for the past year, something that no doctor or test has yet been able to diagnose. It all started with a sudden onset of ‘flu like’ symptoms, primarily sore throat, intestinal gas & constipation and white spots & patches in mouth & cheeks (candida). I never did anything to expose myself to any sort of dangerous virus, so to get this in the middle of summer last year was extremely suspicious. I immediately noticed all my symptoms relate 1:1 to an HIV acute infection. But from where ? Never had I been exposed to te virus. I even went as far as suspecting my gf of cheating on me. I tested negative to HIV 5 times in the following 8 months. I was told to stop testing, as my gf is anyway also negative & feeling fine. But the symptoms and primarily the oral candida & stomach problems never went away, one year after this madness started. I have crazy amounts of gas / burping, my stomach hurts A LOT after every stool, all my stools are very inconsistent in fact. It’s never a relief to go to the bathroom anymore. Moreover, the white spots & patches in my cheeks and on my tongue keep reappearing all the time. They start like little pimples and then degenerate into this white circle or patch that leaves a red surface behind when my body clears it. My gums have receded a lot. What I’m sure of is that this is oral candida. But is it because of a candida overgrowth ? Is it from an immune system collapse ? What can I do and what should I do next to get to the bottom of this, as it is affecting the quality of my life tremendeously ? Hope to hear some suggestions and many thanks in advance."
1,HeatherJ,89,"hello from Culemborg! Yup, sounds like candida. You may want to start by going on the diet outlined on this site. Zero sugar, which no beer during soccer season. Sorry. I will leave all of the advice to the very experienced experts. But I will give you a few shopping tips. You will read a lot about anti-fungals. You can buy good quality coconut oil at AH. BTW, you can also great coconut milk at Tokko markets (Aroy-D)-the diet calls for elimination of dairy and coconut milk is a great replacement. Raster is very fond of SF722,a powerful anti fungal, and it is available online (75 Euros for 250 gel caps). You can also find good quality Oil of Oregano (my favorite anti-fungal). When you can, go with Solgar brand as their supplements are free of fillers. You can buy Pau D’arco tea (or capsules) online, or at Erica-an organic market in Utrecht. their staff is very helpful! There are quite a few product recommendations here that are either impossible to find in NL, or very expensive. Try Amazon Germany or France-I’ve had a lot of luck there. You may hear a lot about 3-Lac. You can buy it online (also 75 Euro). Many people, myself included, have had bad experiences with it. Tread carefully. The most basic approach would involve naturally occurring probiotics. Bio zuurkool is full of them! Also, you can go onto Marktplaats and order kefir grains so that you can make your own kefir. Yes, you can buy kefir, but what you buy in the store isn’t nearly as potent as what you make at home. If you find a doctor who is familiar with Candida, please pass on the contact info. So, you will have to cut out the chocolate sprinkle sandwiches, shoarma and all that good stuff. But it sounds as if you are catching this relatively early. You are lucky that way. Don’t hesitate to contact me for shopping advice. Good luck!"
2,raster,89,"Your immune system likely was compromised in the past via antibiotics and/or vaccines and the pathogenic yeast took over. One thing is you likely have co-infections including other bad bacteria that have overgrown. Sore throats are a strept throat and mono symptom so don’t rule these out. There are a lot of things similar in symptoms to yeast overgrowth including sibo (small bacteria overgrowth), h. pylori, strept, etc. so be sure to get proper testing before embarking on this journey. Candida isn’t something you can get over quickly from my experience, and so plan on a 6-18 month recovery to get over it. The gas problems are likely related to deficiences in stomach acid: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6027_Hydro-chloric-Acid-and-Health–written-by-Dr–McCoombs.aspx If your are deficient in stomach acid, then bad bugs and bacteria and yeast can take over. -raster"
3,jotun,89,"Hi all and thanks for the replies. How nice to find someone from the Netherlands. I am goign through serious depression and that’s why I didn’t reply. I can’t even get my work done properly anymore.  It’s all colon pain all day long and white patches in my mouth, I am going crazy. To some of the above comments: I am not a drinker, do not crave sweets, and have never been sick a day in my life : I have almost never taken pills, never taken antibiotics or anything like that. This whole madness started abruptly with those terrible flu-like sypmtoms and then candida and stomach troubles that don’t go away. I am totally confused, so are all doctors. I just don’t understand from where I could get something like this, the first thing I am looking for is a source. Then a clear diagnostic…are there any clear cut tests to confirm the diagnostic ? PS: have done over 100 (!) tests for any pathogen you can imagine (heliocbater, salmonella, and any other thing under the sun)…all negative. I am truly lost."
4,HeatherJ,89,"Jotun- I’m sorry that you are feeling so blue-especially when the weather is so lovely. Regarding the doctors: if you can find a huisarts in NL who will run the following tests http://www.thecandidadiet.com/testingforcandida.htm, let me know. But the thing is, these tests might not confirm anything and may lead to more waiting and more confusion if the results don’t match your symptoms. And good luck getting a referral to a specialist given the new guidelines… The absolute best thing you can do is within your control: change your diet. Cut out all sugars. Recipes are given, as are guidelines for supplements and eliminations, on this forum and on the main site. Today, go to a natural vitamin store and buy maridstel and molybdenum to prepare your liver for detox. Start taking them now. Also, begin to wean yourself from coffee, sugar and dairy. Totally sucks but cold turkey is worse. Then, this weekend, take three days to yourself-keep your agenda clear-and try a detox. If you feel horrible, YAY, you are expelling toxins. The diet guidelines also suggest detox water: water, lemon and cayenne. Bleck! You can also find detox capsules-they seem to do the trick, but the water is cheaper. An important side-note: you can’t be constipated while on a detox-you will make yourself sick(er). Over the weekend, purchase the book offered through the site, read it, and make a plan. You can also find many recipes on Pinterest. This forum offers a ton of support and people willing to answer questions as they arise. Scan through it and find what applies to your circumstance: You aren’t alone. And look for a mesolog (alternative medicine dr) near you…you might strike gold and find an expert, or at least someone who can recognize and confirm your symptoms. Traditional medicine doesn’t usually recognize Candida… In the end, it really doesn’t matter how this happened, only that you have to face it and be strong. Knowing how it happened won’t cure you, and the stress related to anxiety is only making things worse. And this is tough (the toughest part for me quite honestly) but cheer-up and find comfort in the fact that this is something you can control. Holland offers some the best-and freshest -produce in the world. The summertime is the best time of year to begin the diet because there are so many fresh veggies and the Dutch diet is much lighter; no stompot. Good luck! And, again, so sorry this falls in soccer season."
5,jotun,89,"Hi Heather, Well depression affects me mostly because I am uncertain of the diagnostic. Yes, I can see white spots in my mouth and I feel terrible with my colon, but then that’s it ? Well I can always try out the diet and see if it works. Btw, have you experienced similar symptoms or maybe these exact ones ? I’ve read a long list of symptoms this can cause, but for me it’s really just the mouth inflammations and colon troubles. My huisarts has been really great. Now he won’t send me to a specialist to save his life, but I understand him. He sent me to the KNO, jaw surgeon, of course to gastroenterology (endoscopy didn’t show anything of course), infectious diseases (I have been at a HIV specialist in Slotervaart / Ams). He ordered a billion tests, including multiple HIV test when I was coming up with different reasons why I’d be infected (including an assumption that a nurse at the hospital might have used a contaminated needle). Overall, he’s done a lot and they spent a lot of money on my tests. Nothing was ever found, not a single trace of a single pathogen.Some of the docs I’ve seen multiple times. I am really a well known presence in a couple of hospitals here. Nothing ever found. Funny thing, 2 weeks ago I had a cold. It took about 3 days to recover, but in these days, as my immune system became engaged, all the candida in my mouth was gone. In fact, it was gone for almost 10 days. Now it’s back. It’s as if my immune system just passively watches all this, that is so frustrating. In the past I have tried coconut oil, vitamin D supplements, probiotics of course, some other light meds (esomeprazol for example). Sometimes I feel a lot better with my colon, but for very short periods of time. I have never a full week or so when I feel fine. This has been going on for A YEAR, which fuels the frustration so much. A friend of a friend went to these guys at http://www.ah-shi.nl. I know it says accupuncture, but he swears they proposed a diet for him with all sorts of detox elements and he felt great. Apparently he had some sort of leaky gut, and doctors were at a loss as they couldn’t find anything that works. After he visited these guys he said he struck gold, and after their diet, he feels fine now. I will give them a call and report back to you as well. Thank you for all the support."
6,HeatherJ,89,"hi Jotun- My symptoms are crazy and wide-ranging. They began over ten years ago. Sometimes they would subside and then I would have a flare-up. Moving here was pretty stressful and that stress made me sicker than I have ever been in my life: weeks of constipation, insomnia, depression, panic attacks, unexplained weight gain…the list goes on. I was on the verge of starting a small baking business, serving the expat community, and all of that tasting & testing sent me spiraling. (BTW, I was really strict about calorie intake and exercised regularly. My caloric intake did not add up to significant weight gain.) Then I prayed on it. I know that isn’t big in these parts, but the next day I remembered a suspicion I’d had a few years earlier of Candida and it all fell into place. I began the diet soon after and felt a lot of relief from many symptoms. I envy you for your huisarts. Mine is nice enough, but I feel as if he is just playing along…in his defense, I’m pretty American in my approach: I have no hesitation in self-diagnosis and asking him to confirm or prove me wrong. I’ve explained candida to him, shared articles and demonstrated progress; I still don’t think he’s a believer. I think the fact that I look just fine while telling them my long list of symptoms seems to discredit me. I mean, who can’t have a BM for three weeks??? I’d suggest you ask you huisarts to run the tests. If he can find a measurable, that would be great in helping you measure your progress. Then share his contact info with me 🙂 With all of the things you tried, did you also change your diet? When this all began, I would have similar flare-ups. The doctor said I had IBS…I had the worst cramps. It was as if something would just wash over me and I felt all kinds of yuck. I couldn’t find a pattern, and it wasn’t with every meal. I would go for weeks and feel just fine. Then I began gaining about two pounds a month for no reason. I was super thin, so Drs just thought I had an eating disorder and dismissed me, not realizing that as a former bulimic I know the calorie count to almost every food and am expert at keeping myself within normal range. When all is said and done, looking back I would say that stress made everything worse. Going to doctors with my lists and feeling the scorn of their rejection was totally not fun. Having tests done that only rendered normal results, while I could feel something brewing, was dismal. You are right-totally call your friend’s clinic. But the regimen given here is full of all kinds of natural detoxing elements-garlic, oil or oregano, coconut oil, onions. The diet is limited and eliminates almost all allergens-unless you are allergic to vegetables, meat and every form of coconut you can imagine. And leaky gut is not uncommon with Candida-you can have both. I have seen all sorts of plans on line and this is the strictest and, I think the best. Initially, it doesn’t call for a lot of supplements. As you follow this forum, you will find ALL kinds of suggestions for supplements. But don’t bite off more than you can chew-detox first and see what happens. And I don’t know what level of insurance you have, but I know the highest level covers homeopathic massage-rather it covers half of the cost of an approved provider. I found this kind of treatment to be very helpful. I have noticed that the Dutch like to have confirmation from doctors…but that isn’t always possible. The easiest way to confirm this is to go on the diet for a month and see how you feel. Trust yourself… And have you tried oil pulling? If you use coconut oil, it might help your thrush. Either way, it gives you really white teeth."
7,HeatherJ,89,"Hey Jotun- So, did you do it? If so, how are you doing??"
8,jotun,89,"Hi Heather, Much to my shame, I didn’t do anything. I am so depressed about this and in a state of total confusion. I feel like starting any sort of regimen or treatment without some specialist support is not good, but I had another thrush outbreak this weekend and it’s not pretty. My cheeks look like someone punched me in the face repeatedly (on the inside I mean). I have arranged for a dermatologist and infectious disease dr visit, and I actually found a doctor in my own country that not only acknowledges candida, but he said is treating many ppl for it. Thing is, he said I should have this insane crave for sugars if I had candida. But I don’t crave sugar at all. It does seem that after eating cakes (I had one at the Dutch game on Friday) I get thrush almost overnight. Still, I crave nothing and eat a very balanced diet. Very rarely I have smth sweet. So do I have it, or not ? Do I have another underlying cause and we are not finding it ?  Totally confused. I suppose one way to go is to actually start a diet & antifungals like oil of oregano. But everytime I want to buy some, I’m thinking if this is really what is bugging me or I should be treating smth else. I hate medicine !"
9,HeatherJ,89,"Okay, you don’t have to go crazy about buying antifungals and starting a regimen. You said that you wanted some sort of confirmation; that you aren’t sure if you even have candida. So, I suggested that you begin the diet and see what happens…if you want to keep it simple, omit sugar, buy some good quality coconut oil ( http://www.kokosolienederland.nl) take some with every meal. I would suggest 1 tsp with every meal…but others might say more. Basically, eat non-starchy vegetables and organic beef & chicken. Almonds are okay, peanuts are not. No green beans. No bread…no cola or juice. No fruit.  No coffee or caffeine. And no snack bar food. It totally sucks at first, but you get used to it. See how it goes for a couple of days…and there is the detox drink. Check out the recipes on Lisa’s sight for the exact recipe. I take detox supplements to detox. But, when all is said and done, if you feel like absolute rott, you have some sort of confirmation. If you wanted to ease your discomfort, you could buy some supplements. But if you want confirmation, this is the way to go. Of course you aren’t craving sugar-you haven’t stopped consuming it, silly. And be careful about the “experts.” I live in a medium sized village, centrally located, and I just met with an “expert.” She’s written a book with recipes that include brown rice, wheat and fruit (pineapple of all things!). She’s cured her candida with this diet…but everyone is different. She did not recommend the use of probiotics and said that the whole gluten-free thing is a trend that has no bearing on Candida sufferers. Whatever. For some people, not necessarily you, she couldn’t be more wrong. Anyway, whether you know it or not, the Dutch tend to be a couple years behind America in almost everything. I’m not criticizing Holland-that is just the way it is. I’ve read a lot about Candida, seen many plans and spoken with a few local “experts” and the advice you get on this site-once you begin the program-is the best you will find. No one is selling you anything. There are no billable hours. People just want to support others as they struggle. And everyone takes personal responsibility for their health… I would love to know who Candida expert is? I am at a disadvantage with Google because my Dutch is so poor. I have only found the guy, with the baby face, who will test your blood and does some sort of radiation treatment and the seemingly eccentric (but very nice) man who will test your hair. Then has been some Candida research being done by doctors in NL and I plan to track these docs down: http://www.narcis.nl/search/uquery/candida/Language/EN/coll/person/pageable/0  There are several mesoloogs around…one in my village claims to be an “expert” but his protocol didn’t make as much sense; Vitamin C and omega 3s won’t cure Candida alone. So, be careful about what advice you follow. I hate to break this to you, but many Dutch doctors aren’t very good. I’ve been in NL for three years and literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON I KNOW has some sort of medical horror story that was a result of a doctor’s incompetence. In all honesty, your initial doctor should have recognized the Thrush (candida) on your tongue and given you Nystatine. If you end up going that route, you will serve yourself best by still cutting out the sugar. At the end of the day, if you have Candida you will have to stop the sugar. May as well save yourself a lot of time, and drama, and just give it a go. It doesn’t have to be this complicated. You can do it!!! Good luck!"
0,Fungaway,90,"4 years ago my candida took over all of a sudden, like overnight. It took me this long to figure out that it’s probably candida. The closest thing I could find until now was hypothyroidism, and nothing I was doing was helping. It was tough for me because some of the symptoms hit me really suddenly and it was actually when I was probably the healthiest I had ever been, just lost a little weight, stopped eating as much bread. I thought I was just getting old. So now after 2 weeks on the diet and supplements I’ve lost a little fat, and the bloating, itching, dry skin, foot fungus, sugar/starch cravings, back pain, constant thirst, sensitivity to bandaids, and dandruff have all lessened. That’s a lot of stuff! I’ve never had so many symptoms, that I didn’t even know were symptoms until they lessened, start going away like this. And for years I’ve been messing with apple cider vinegar, epsom salt/baking soda baths, iodine, massage, and many other supplements to try to reverse whatever condition I had, with little sign that any of it was working. And I have a bit more energy, and I’m not as hungry. I didn’t really eat anything today until the evening, and I was fine. The hunger now is more subtle. I’ve even been eating some beans without any noticeable bad effects. I’m finally transitioning to using food as an energy resource, eating what I need to depending on how active I’m going to be, instead of using food to satiate myself. It’s funny, many years ago I intuitively knew that eating mainly raw veggies was the way for me to go, and I could sense the cleansing and better health it would give me, but I just wasn’t ready to do it. And this started before the diet, but I’m also getting really good at telling whether food is going to give me energy. I could tell right away the wild caught salmon I baked was good, and yet the salmon burgers I broiled made from the same salmon dropped my energy. It turned out the burgers had wheat mixed in them! I had been aware of candida for years but never was sure enough about whether I had it, or I wasn’t willing to really go full bore by giving up so many foods. I don’t plan on going back to eating most of those foods. Well I could go on and on about more stuff, but let’s call that good for now. Thanks for the great site and diet plan!"
1,Fungaway,90,"CRAP! I posted a long reply and hit the wrong button. I’ll summarize. False alarm on the dandruff clearing up. It’s still there. I ate a bunch of rice crackers one day for a sudden binge and really quick got bloating, itching, achy muscles, had no energy for exercise, until about 24 hrs later it went away. I won’t do that again, at least not for a while. I’m discontinuing kombocha, kefir, beans and yogurt. It turns out they all have sugar. They’re all pasteurized. The kombucha I thought was ok, but I got a bunch of plaque the next morning after drinking it. In addition to the food and other stuff mentioned last post I’m taking nascent iodine, Candida Support by NOW Foods, fresh garlic, 300 billion CFU probiotics per day, coconut oil and olive oil. If this doesn’t work nothing will. I’ve read about people finding some limit on these supplements, but I have never hit any kind of limit that I can feel, even with very large doses of probiotics and iodine and other stuff I’ve taken in the past. I assume I’ll get nauseous or something?"
2,Fungaway,90,I just read another article and learned that I’m supposed to take the antifungals and probiotics at different times of the day! I’ve been taking them all at once. Better late than never I guess. But I think my dandruff is starting to slow. I did some head and feet baths in apple cider vinegar.
3,Fungaway,90,"So I found out the white tea I’ve been drinking 5 cups of a day is loaded with caffeine. Here and I thought Trader Joe’s would label it “contains caffeine” like they do some of the other teas. So back to day one. I’ll try this starting again. I am not a caffeine person, so I didn’t know the extra warm feeling I got was from caffeine. No evidence of any candida coming out in my poop yet, and it’s not surprising given the massive doses of caffeine I’ve been taking. I’m also still getting lots of brain fog and tiredness throughout the day, so it may be safe to say I’m still on day one, trying to do it right. I’ve been taking some blueberries occasionally, which help a little with the dreadful taste of raw vegetables. I didn’t mind the veggies at all at first, but when it’s every meal for 2 months it starts to get really old. Another problem is if I start eating one handful of blueberries I’ll eat the entire container. I also started eating some meat and eggs. I’m not really worried about protein. I’m just so sick of veggies that I’m eating that other stuff just to get a break from the veggies. I’d love to eventually go to a mostly fruit diet once I oust the candida."
0,wrfortiscue,91,"Ok so I have been having bad anxiety for about 3 years plus a mirage of symptoms. I used to take a lot of antibiotics when I was younger, and I just took some for my recent prostate infection. I experience fatigue with back pain, constant shortness of breath(worse when hungry or if eating a lot), always craving carbs, exercise intolerance, numbness and tingliness when i cross or bend my limbs even for seconds, all sorts of stomach problems. So I decided why not try this diet! First things I noticed were the first couple of days I have been breathing better. My stomach has been feeling better as well. Other weird things is that my symptoms are jumping all over the place. It has only been 7 strict days but some days I wake up with achy legs(used to before) some hours I feel shortness of breath, and every night when I get sleepy about to fall asleep my anxiety goes through the roof! Is this normal to experience? Also, what are the stages of the diet and how do I do it? I don’t know what to eat for breakfast lol. Thanks"
1,raster,91,"So the first stage you should focus on is stage 1. Check out my food list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9282_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx You need a detox plan: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst9434_Die-off-remedies-post–will-edit-more-in-time.aspx If you don’t devise a strong detox plan, your liver will become damaged by the yeast toxins and will need to be fixed at a later time. The basics to get better involve taking antifungals and probiotics. The safest antifungal I recommend are fatty acid derived antifungals…the one I recommend most is SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne. This will slowly erode the walls of the yeast and cause the pathogenic form of the yeast to morph back to the non-pathogenic form. As far as probiotics, I recommend starting out with human derived probiotics. The only one available in the US is HMF neuro, and you might want to consider HMF forte starting out which doesn’t contain as much probiotics. If you overdo things at first, you will feel like crap. There a variety of other products I can suggest but these 2 are the most important imho. -raster"
2,wrfortiscue,91,I really don;t mind the die off symptoms just want to get rid of this. Where can I find info on the amount of time on each stage and explains each stage in detail. Thanks!
3,raster,91,"There is no time period to plan on for each stage. For me, I was on stage 1 for about a year and then stage 2 for about a year and stage 3 for the last 2 years. It’s taken me 4 years to become symptom free pretty much. I tell most forum members to plan on a 6-18 month recovery time to get over CRC (candida related complex). -raster"
0,Cancan,92,"Ok, so it seems that these symptoms have been hell for all of us. I have tried everything possible to reduce these dreaded albicans: Probiotics, diet, grapefruit seed extract, oregano oil etc… the list goes on and I do not want to bore you with the experimental history. However, I noticed that every time I ate garlic my symptoms would gradually improve. Noticeably, I realized that after consuming this stenchful herb my stomach would be making noises as if something was actually taking effect. So I have started dicing up 3 cloves of garlic and squeezing half a lemon. I put the diced up garlic into a glass, then adding the lemon and topping up with a little bit of water. Like a quick shot, it is easily swallowed. Just after a couple of days of doing this has caused my most annoying symptoms to abate. Has anyone else tried this?"
0,AlexDAK,93,"Hi. I had many strange symptoms for 6 years. Now I am 29. It begins with anxiety and ibs with diarhhea, but 5 years ago they become severe and many other symptoms added. My symptoms are: 1. Chronic fatigue 2. Brain fog, derealization 3. Anxiety 4. IBS-D 5. Light, sound sensitivity 6. Afterimages, visual snow 7. Constant ringing in ears 8. Cold hands 9. Gas, bloating 10. Hair loss 11. Weight loss 12. Feeling my heart beat in my head 13. Cracking joints 14. Many others, that are gone In the beginning my symptoms were so worse, that I stayed at home for 3 month. I usually had a panic attack, when I came out my house. Then, after 1 year my symptoms became less severe. I have much less derealization, panic attacks, no skipping heart beats, no cold feets. So, my worst symptoms are fatigue and brain fog. But fatigue is not as much physical, but mental. I can ride my bike for one hour, but I can’t think clearly and do some mental work (even speak) for a long time. Much of my symptoms are constant. I don’t have days when I feel normal. I had many bloodwork done and made different tests. It’s all ok, except this: My billirubin level is 40, it’s 2x higher, than normal level. I was tested positive with Gylberts syndrom and my doc said it’s nothing to worry about. My cholesterol level is high. HDL is normal, but LDL is 180. My vitamin D is very low. It’s 13, normal level is >30. I tested negative for: celiac, lyme, theroid, EBV, CMV, HIV. Many docs say my symptoms are anxiety related. I read a lot about candida, because my symtoms are very simmilar. I have very strong cravings for sugar. When I had a gluten free and sugar free diet, I had some relief. Also 2 months ago I started to take probiotics, and my IBS-D is 90% better now. So, I made a blood test for candida antibody IgG and it came back positive. I read, it can be positive with systemic candida, but also it can be positive in 10% of population. So, I wonder, if a can have a candida owergrowth problem."
1,TheChosenOne,93,"Hi. Welcome to the forum. It is hard to proof that you have candida. My IgG test was also positive, but my stool test was negative. Thet best way to discover if you have candida is trying the diet and taking antifungals. If you experience die off, you’ll have candida. Most people with candida also have oral thrush. The cause of candida can be diet related, but most candida sufferers have taken antibiotics in their life. Another cause of candida is heavy metal poisoning. Your bilirubin is high, which can indicate impaired glutathione conjugation. This can impair the livers ability to get rid of heavy metals. These people might benefit from NAC supplementation. I also see you have gas. This can be related to enzyme problems. The solution here is to chew your food well and take some enzyme supplements combined with hydrochloric acid (very important!). If your stomach doesn’t make enough stomach acid, a lot of pathogens and parasites can enter your intestines. I recommend you to do a ‘burp test’. This test is easy to execute and very cheap. Most people with chronic fatigue, candida, … have adrenal insufficiency. This is an adverse stress reaction where you adrenals cannot make enough cortisol. This can lead to anxiety and brain fog. Most people with adrenal insuffiency will have recurrent migraines, have a distorted sleep pattern, low blood pressure, high LDL/low HDL, weight loss (inability to gain weight). Adrenal fatigue can be solved by taking vitamin C, B5 (pantothenic acid), adrenal cortex/glands and a bunch of herbs. People with adrenal fatigue usually are hypoglycemic, which means that their insulin levels are too high. A low carb/high protein diet is adviced. Cortisol also increased the body’s resistance to yeast infections. Adrenal fatigue is one of the precursors of thyroid problems. Typical symptoms are cold hands/feet, depression and hair loss. Thyroid problems can be solved by taking iodine and supplement with T3 and T4 hormone. There is no good medical test for thyroid problems! Measuring your T3/T4 or TSH levels will only discover an almost diseased thyroid. Real chronic/systemic conditions are not reveled in this kind of tests. The only way to discover them is to look at the symptoms, administer some supplementary hormone and see if the situation improves. Be careful! Thyroid hormone will increase the metabolism of steroids (like cortisol). Administering thyroid hormone without fixing your adrenals can make adrenal fatigue worse! The fact that you can’t think clearly is related to your brain fog which is a physical and not a mental problem. Most people with candida have low vitamin D. Mine was 19. The normal levels of vitamin D are generally too low. Low vitamin D can be related to bad fat uptake (lack of the lipase enzyme). You should take high doses of vitamin D3 with fatty meals. You may safely take up to 10000 IU/day. YOUR SYMPTOMS ARE NOT ANXIETY RELATED. Docs are so ignorant. It’s the exact opposite. Your anxiety is a symptom, not the cause of your problems. Anxiety is most likely relieved by fixing your adrenals. I have the most success with adrenal cortex extract. Heart palptations and light sensitivity might point towards mercury poisoning. I advice you to read ‘Amalgam Illness, Diagnosis and Treatment’ by Cutler. It is very usefull even if you don’t have mercury poisoning."

1,TheChosenOne,94,"Are you doing a strict candida diet? If so, it seems like you need to slow down. Feeling bad is normal while on the candida diet. Personally, I never cried while on the diet, but I did feel really bad. Sometimes I felt anger right before a meal. Did you do a detox before starting the diet? Forgetting things can be very annoying. I have a similar problem, but not as bad as you. Forgetting things can be a neurological problem which can be related to a lot of things. Do your hands tremble? How do your bowels look like? Does your liver hurt if you push on it? Do you eat enough fats? Are you sometimes feeling anxious? How did you feel before starting the diet and before having candida? Did you feel/act different than other children? How do you sleep? When do you go to bed? At what time do you get up? Are you just feeling sad or is it because you feel tired all day? Do you take supplements? If so, which ones? Have you ever done a blood test? Sorry for all the questions, but this is the only way to figure out what causes the problem. In the meantime go slow on the candida diet and take some rest."
2,befreenow,94,"Hi Jenny, I have faith in you. You can make it through this. First, I would stop smoking marijuana so often. We humans often use drugs like these to medicate and suppress. But, it actually worsens lots of things in the body and mind. Have you tried visiting with a counselor or therapist? Have you tried meditation? Perhaps, you could take some long walks in nature. Get out of the house a bit. Exercise a bit more. It’s good to remind yourself “life is a long journey, and I am at the beginning of it. Right now I am experiencing pain because of things I have thought, said, and done in the past. I accept fully the present moment and am determined to focus on the positives in life.” Maybe write some of your thoughts down. Writing can be therapeutic. Life is about taking responsibility for our thoughts, words, and actions. When we start taking responsibility we realize we have control of our destiny. The victim mindset will keep us from making good decisions for ourselves. Peace and Joy, dear."

8,mash2100,94,"Heyy girl! I know EXACTLY what you’re going through with the yeast infection and the relationship troubles. I’ve been with my boyfriend now for two years and sometimes I feel like I could lose him at any second. My mood swings have been crazy and I’ve been going off on people too.. just constantly irritated. Have you spoken to him about what you’re gong through with this infection? If not, you MUST. I spoke to my boyfriend so he understands my situation enough to where he doesn’t take the things I do to heart.  As far as the infection and the diet goes, I know how hard it can be to eat healthy and maintain a strict candida diet. I’m about to enter my 2nd year in college so you already know I’m broke. I use the little bit of money I get in school refunds and from my parents just for food and it fucking sucks. I can’t go out with my friends or eat at restaurants or buy anything I want. If I want to get christmas or birthday gift for my boyfriend, I struggle for weeks in advanced just save up enough money. This is diet is like a rich people, no joke. BUT, you HAVE TO stick to it as best you can. No matter how hungry you get you just cannot slip up and eat bread or icecream or drink milk.. nothing. That happens to me a lot. My mom will come from grocery shopping with all these sweets and breads and they’re just in my face every time I walk in the kitchen so I slip up and eat a little bit, thinking it won’t do any harm and it does. One little bite and it sets me back about a week!!  I also can’t have sex with my boyfriend because every time I do it just irritates me. We had to start using condoms because I would be so dry or my natural lube would be sticky and white (the yeast) and it would chafe his penis and hurt my vagina. In fact, he has a mild male yeast infection which causes his penis to be slightly sore constantly and have little bumps. Another reason for the condom… to prevent the back and forth spreading of the infection. Still however, sex has become an occasional thing between us and when we do have it, it usually doesn’t feel as good as it should.  I used to cry all the time and I constantly lost hope. I felt so alone in this.  You have to push through it though. It’s not going to be easy and it might take you a while to truly be on a strict anti candida diet. Anyways, just wanted to let you know you’re not alone and that I know this situation feels unfair because you’re young and you’re in a long term relationship but you can take control of this. Don’t let this rule your life. 🙂 If you ever need any advice or someone to talk to, definitely hit me up!"
9,jenny,94,do you live in fl?
10,mash2100,94,"Yeah, are you from fl too?"
11,jenny,94,yes i live in plant city fl
12,kmcheney48,94,"I know how hard it is too. You have come to the right place you are definitely not alone. I thought I was going to push away my boyfriend when I was at my worst but thankfully he has stuck by me. I was crying almost all day everyday, to the point where there were no tears left for me to cry. It would happen out of nowhere too and I was very on edge, not acting like myself. I was snapping at everyone. And if youre like me, when I’m upset I reach for the cookies and ice cream, which I cant do anymore. Cant even go out drinking with friends but I would give all of it up to feel good. True friends will stick by you whether you can go out or not. Also its so expensive maintaining a diet like this I have been struggling with that. You have to be stronger than the Candida. You are so young and have a life to be had. I know its easier said that done when you are mentally and physically drained, just stick to the diet. Try and keep a budget of money that you can only spend on food. youre stronger than you think, dont let the Candida take a hold of your life, were all here to help you"
13,joe,94,"This sounds exactly like me…I was nervous had anxiety issues. I couldn’t even call my bank to ask a simple question without getting nervous and panicked. I went to my dr. to get anxiety pills…didn’t work. I finally saw something on Facebook out of the blue ( well maybe it was all the praying I did at church) I saw a page for the symptoms of candida and my head exploded. Yes that’s it! I have never been lactose intolerant, gluten intolerant, food was making me sick. I’m convinced it has to do with GMO’s but that’s another post. My slurred speach and eye twitching was so bad I couldn’t even look people in the eye and avoided any type of conversations. Now that is all cleared up thanks to the diet, it works great. My advise is follow Lisa’s plan as close as possible and the issues will clear up, make sure to take some good liver and lung support supplements."
0,kmcheney48,95,"I dont even know where to begin. What a hell of a ride this has been. So I guess the story begins of me at 8 years old. I had a condition Vesicoureteral reflux which is a backflow of urine into kidneys. I was born with this but it was not apparent until I was around 8. After extensive testing and hospital stays and blah blah blah I was put on antibiotics to control the infection and constant UTIs and kidney infections which cause scarring as well. I was on antibiotics everyday for about 3 years. When I was on antibiotics for a while into it my mother asked many doctors if there was anything else I could do besides take long term antibiotics and they told her that I would die if I did not. Eventually I outgrew this condition thankfully and my bladder and kidneys became healthy. After being on antibiotics for about 3 years I had no immunity to anything. I was getting sick with everything left and right constantly when I was 11-13 years old. My mother took me to an acupuncturist/herbalist to possibly help. After seeing this Dr for about a year I was healthy as an ox. I never got sick anymore and I finally felt normal. Skip ahead to when I was 20 years old. I thought it would be a good idea if I got the HPV vaccine for my own safety. I received the vaccine and a few hours later I became severely ill. Severe dizziness, nausea, extreme low body temperature. The next day I felt better, but a week later I started getting numbness and tingling in my arms and legs, I was so weak I could barely walk across my room, my friends told me my skin looked gray, the worst headache ever, extreme fatigue I could sleep all day and still be exhausted, no appetite, etc. Went to all sorts of drs and specialists. They thought I may have had MS. Had every test done in the book, blood work, stress tests, EEG, EMG, brain MRIs, etc. They found absolutely nothing wrong with me. It felt as if I was dying. Over months i had slowly started to.recover. I had to learn how to keep my balance again while walking. I had a headache for about a year straight. I wouldn’t say i was exactly the same person I was but I bounced back to myself again. No one ever figured out what was wrong with me but I was so happy I was better. Now skip ahead to today. I am 25 years old. I’m very active and have a very demanding job on my feet all day, and I always did fine. Several months ago I notice I am constantly getting sinus infections and being put on antibiotics and steroids. I then notice I am very tired all the time, and no matter what I eat or drink I am getting extremely abnormally bloated with lots of gas and acid reflux. I am nauseous after I eat and just don’t feel right. I remember a night I drank 1 glass of wine and I was so weak I couldn’t move, but I honestly just thought I hadn’t eaten much that day and I was just feeling it more. I’m getting weaker and more tired and dizzy. I go to my Dr who does blood work and it comes back fine. Tells me its probably allergies and sinus issues and gives me nasonex. I then go to an ENT who gives me more antibiotics and steroids since now my nasal discharge is bloody. A few days later I am beyond exhausted, I get a yeast infection despite my efforts not too since I always get them on antibiotics, my vision is now blurry, I am extremely dizzy, spaced out as if I wasn’t really awake, nauseous, weak, sensitive to the light, and I have a headache. All of this was eerily similar to 5 years ago from the vaccine. By that night my headache got so bad and my right eye was in severe pain, I had to go to the ER. They found nothing after a CT scan. Weeks later I am just getting worse and Dr after Dr no one knows what’s wrong and I am freaking out because it feels like I am slowly dying. My skin was pale as a ghost and I could barely move. Got more extensive blood work, another brain MRI, allergy tests, etc, and nothing except for some disc herniations and I am now nearsighted. I lose all hope. I then notice the right side of my face is swollen. A mass in my face that was painful. I am a complete mess and I am afraid to sleep at night because I feel as if I will pass away in my sleep, so I can’t sleep more than 3 hours a night. One day I see my aunt and thank the lord I did. She had said to me how she went through something similar. Candida overgrowth she said. She told me about what happened and how every test she took came back normal and how many visits she took to the ER because it felt as if I was dying. She told me about this Dr in my area that diagnosed her and treated her. I then think to myself about how similar this is to the vaccine, and wonder to myself if this is what happened to me 5 years ago. I go onto the Merck website and in bold letters on contraindications of the vaccine it says that people with yeast hypersensitivity should not receive the vaccine. I immediately called this Dr and he fit me in the next day. I wake up the morning I’m supposed to see him and I can barely move and feel as if I’m going to faint. I really feel as if I’m dying. I’ve never felt so awful before. My boyfriend drives me to go see him and as I am called into the room I start bursting out in tears. I feel broken and that even though this may be the answer, that nothing would help. My boyfriend starts to talk to for me about what has been going on as I try to compose myself. I then explain everything going on and all of my history. He is 110% sure that I have Candida overgrowth. He puts me on the Candida diet and gives me to antifungal medications. He also told me to buy the book The Candida Cure, which is an amazing book for people with Candida overgrowth. I also stopped taking my birth control that I had been taking for 7 years. The next few days I still feel awful, which is normal. My body is in so much pain everywhere and I’m exhausted but can’t sleep and I have my period on top of everything. I go through some die off and I am so nauseas and cannot eat. I almost vomited once but never did. This all started a few months ago and today I am almost better. The growth in my face ended up being nothing and it is almost gone. Still following the diet and still on Nystatin and taking supplements, I am slowly getting better. I would say 2 weeks ago was the first day I was really able to be active all day. I am still more tired than usual, and still feel a little spaced out but that’s about it. I am hoping with more time and working at this problem I can be back to my normal self again completely. What a crazy road and I am SO LUCKY that my aunt told me about this. If she hadn’t I would have probably declined for a very long time without any answers like some other unfortunate people. I also had support from my whole family, friends, and boyfriend which I am lucky to have. It felt like it happened overnight out of nowhere, but who knew that this has probably been going on for almost my whole life. I hope that if anyone needs help or someone to talk to I am here to help! We are all candida survivors."
1,raster,95,"I recommend talking to your ND about detoxing because this should make you feel better. You are at a very delicate state right now so it could cause problems, so I would consult him. When you kill yeast you need to detox, its the most important thing to do! -raster"

3,kmcheney48,95,Thank you!! What exactly does the detox entail???
0,astnr1,96,"Hi everyone, Today was my second to last day of detox, and I feel I am having scary die-off symptoms and need someone to help me rationalize. At first it was physical; hot and cold flashes, nausea, aversion to food, extreme fatigue—my oral thrush seems to have gotten worse, as well. Now that these symptoms have waned somewhat (apart from the thrush), it is starting to manifest psychologically. In addition to the anxiety and depression, I am now having episodes of paranoia that are affecting my sleep. I just started taking a supplement called CandiZyme to improve my detox symptoms, as I already had Lamisil in my system and it was pretty hard on me. Could the two be having adverse effects to each other? Or is this psychological issue just another symptom of die-off? How do I cope? I wake up with my heart racing if I do fall asleep, but for the past two nights I haven’t really been able to sleep deeply anyway. When will these bad symptoms start to clear up? 🙁 Am I crazy?"
1,raster,96,"What is your detox protocol? If you are not detoxing the toxins from the dead candida, then they will recirculate in the body causing damage to a variety of organs including your brain. If it damages your brain then you get anxiety. Fatty acids likely will help prevent the anxiety and a good one to try out is flax oil. Lamisil is a prescription antifungal product and you need to detox from it imho. -raster"
2,Vegan Catlady,96,"If your not excreting the toxins (even small amounts of them)then circulate and can cause anxiety,paranoia, suicidal depression. I had this happen, I got through it and im fine. I dont believe anxiety comes from brain-damage at all, or I would not be functioning right now. Toxins might be your issue, or it might be that you have conflicting things in your system. Either way, it wont last forever and you’ll be okay, but you need some relief. For relief you might want to slow down down with whatever your taking, do some hot lemon-water upon waking and before bed, and make food choices that encourage easy digestion and fast elimination."
3,BeccaJR,96,"When I first started taking anything that chelated or detoxed (even chia seeds and beets) I had the same symptoms as well as other neurological symptoms (loss of depth perception, clumsiness, numbness in legs). An iridologist told me part of it is the body not being able to dispose of everything that is dying off or getting stirred around. It’s like taking the garbage out of all of the rooms in your house, but because it’s not garbage day you put all of those bags of garbage into your kitchen, and it gets in your way and slows things down. Hopefully this isn’t too personal, but how are your bowel movements? Other signs of inadequate bowel movements and the body not being able to handle toxicity include breakouts of acne. Doing things to support your liver like milk thistle or a warm glass of water with a freshly squeezed lemon might help you as well. When I get these symptoms I also drink aloe vera juice mixed in with something else (it’s horribly bitter) to soothe my stomach and promote bowel movements and take long hot detox baths, here’s a good link on how."

0,mash2100,97,"I apologize for the length of this but I just joined the forum and felt the need to get my story out there because I have no idea as to what else I can do. My story begins in the fall of 2012, a couple of months after having met my current boyfriend. When we first started dating, we would have sex all of the time, sometimes two or three times in a row. We would get creative from having sex outdoors, to the pool (happened twice), or in the bath tub. All was well until I began to feel dry down there. I also suffered from two UTIs so I took some antibiotics for that. Sex was no longer fun, it just became this dreadful and painful thing for both my boyfriend and I. I’m ashamed to say that I tried toughing it out for several months, thinking it was just some phase or that I needed to drink more water, etc… Because we didn’t use condoms, he began feeling the effects of my dryness as well, often complaining that he had a chafed penis. For months I thought I was suffering from vaginal dryness and we tried using condoms again and all sorts of lubes, but to no avail. I finally visited the gyno in October of 2013 and told them my problem. They checked me and voila! I had a mild yeast infection. Mild or not, the thing was persistent. It just wouldn’t go away. There was never any itching or redness, just a constant, thin, sticky, white discharge. After telling my boyfriend, he began suspecting that he might have a yeast infection on the head of his penis since it always felt sore. We both have tried monistat and coconut oil and I even underwent a course of diflucan but nothing helped. It took me a while to figure out I needed to make some serious lifestyle changes. I started the Candida Diet in December. Needless to say, it was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be. I didn’t get really serious about it until maybe two months ago. I just recently started taking Healthy Origins probiotics and because I go to college in my hometown, I go home every weekend to bake snacks and make food to bring back to the dorm with me for that week since my school’s cafeteria options are not very candida-friendly. Almost always if I do eat at my school, I get a grilled chicken salad. But even then I’m afraid because I know their meats aren’t organic and probably contain antibiotics. I try so hard to stick to the diet and the probiotics and I often find myself buying monistat 7 over and over again. It’s exhausting and costly, and it doesn’t even seem to work. My boyfriend has been so good to me and supportive throughout all of it, especially since he’s still suffering from soreness and redness on the head of his penis. I know we brought this upon ourselves for not practicing safer sex. And now we just can’t seem to get rid of it. I haven’t had sweets or bread in months and my boyfriend and I rarely have sex. My social life has gone completely out the window… I feel so helpless! Candida is ruining my relationships and I keep reading stories about how people suffer from it for years and years and it makes me just want to break down and cry. I have no clue where else to turn or who to turn to. My fear is that I will be left penniless from all the trips I make to whole foods just to bake a f***ing loaf of coconut bread and that I will lose the love of my life because I don’t know how much longer our relationship can withstand this. It’s not normal for two 19 and 23 year old college students to be going through this and especially so since we have NO ONE else to relate to."
1,HopeSprings,97,I wish I could give you GREAT advice. Although not knowing I have suffered from Candida for 10 yrs I am just on my third go around of trial and error to get rid of it. Is that ever possible? Some say yes. I feel for you as my daughter is in college and your age so I know its hard. I believe she has Candida issues as well but doesnt want to acknowledge them. At least you are. Try your best with the diet and make sure to stay faithful with the probiotics and anti fungals. I am way older then you and I slip and cheat on the diet too. Its hard and expensive for me. Hang in there. I hope things get better.
2,Jessgentry26,97,"Girl, I hear you. I’m a college student as well-20 years old. I have tested negative constantly for candida and recently my health got SO poor that I couldn’t even get up from the couch. I recently went to a doctor in NYC who is an infectious disease specialist (i had to withdraw from college–this is after eating fish and veggies for months otherwise the bloating would be too severe) and my parents are desperate to want to get me better. I gave up alcohol, bread, anything starchy, grains, fruits, the whole nine yards. This doctor in NYC actually found an amoeba called E. Histolitica that no other doctor found in stool tests or anything. I’m on a two week treatment of paromicin and he also said he didn’t see any signs of candida…yeah. I’m skeptical though. Maybe i’m over paranoid because i’ve been sick for so long, but I’ve tried eating sugar while on the paromicin and still no change, i begin to swell all over, and i can feel my stomach get SO tight and the bloating gets severe 🙁 I’ve never had a white tongue and even when my gyno cultured for yeast it came back negative. So idk, maybe these meds take longer to work. But I do know that it could be something other than candida. You could have a parasite of some sort. Just something to think about..and trust me i DO relate to you entirely. It sucks being a sorority sister and an average college student and feel like your missing out on the best 4 years of your life…its complete bull shit. I wish you the best of luck and let me know if you need any advice! I’ve been through a shit ton of testing."
3,raster,97,"My ND feels that anyone who has candida in their sexual organs likely has it in their kidneys, so it might be difficult for you to treat this on your own. He has some specific remedies to clear it out of the kidneys and sexual organs but I just don’t know what they are…but you can get better if you find the right ND in my opinion. His treatment costs a few hundred per month typically plus appts. so it might not be feasible. Additionally, a proper treatment is expensive and it might be hard for you guys to treat this while in college. I graduated 9 years ago and I understand what you are going through and imho its very hard to treat this while in school mainly because of financial constraints. I ended up getting a job working 20+ hours per week and got on food stamps and this helped me a lot financially (but I wasn’t treating myself for health problems then). I also made the dorm food for my school and I definitely know that they use the cheapest quality food possible (or atleast very likely). So the chicken you are eating is likely the lowest grade out there (sysco) which is unfortunate. If anything, you could maybe write a letter to the university stating how much you pay for school but you get crap for what you pay. Then mention antibiotic resistent infections and how their food contributes to the problem. Anyways, thats about the best you can do on that front lol. My suggestion is to treat this when out of school, try to get your parents to fund you going to an ND for this, or get a job and find a good ND to treat this while in school… -raster"
4,mash2100,97,"Thank you all so much for your responses and advice! I’m glad to know I’m not alone in this. I have however been thinking lately that maybe I’m not suffering from an overgrowth of candida albicans at all, maybe it’s a different strain such as candida tropicalis (the second most common type of yeast infection.) These other strains seem to not respond to OTC meds and in fact have become resistant to them."
5,raster,97,Its likely not one strain but multiple strains…and each one responds differently to different antifungals. -raster
6,spider,97,"Take a high quality probiotic in the morning when you wake up on an empty stomach. Search around the forums and you’ll see the probiotic recommendations, although I personally like VSL # 3 and Prescript Assist. Stop eating bread/grains, sugar (soda, candy, fruits), and cut out Alcohol. Do that and you’re on the road to recovery. I’m in college as well and don’t find that the low-quality meats and veggies effect my candida. The only things that effect it is when I eat grains and/ sugary foods. Trust me, cut out those few things and you will start feeling better. Also add a anti fungal like Oil of Oregano in the afternoon, and eat Coconut oil everyday. When you’re in the cafeteria, there are always options of meat and veggies. chicken or beef and veggies….Some might argue that it’s not ideal, but it’s definitely better than the pasta, chicken nuggets, coke, etc. that other kids are eating. You will start feeling better soon – don’t look at it like you need to do everything perfectly right now. Just a decent probiotic, and cut out some bad foods. Also try using coconut oil as lube…it’s great as lube and is good for the vagina/penis."
7,TheChosenOne,97,"I have the same problem here. What you have to do is use cheap antifungals like oregano oil, red thyme and brussels sprouts. Eat a lot of veggies and try to buy organic meat if you can. I’m lucky that my parents pay for my food, so my only expenses are my supplements."

I had been through several topicals, and nothing worked until I was put on Lamisil. Now my feet are visibly improving, but I still have itching and burning, and on my hands as well. 7 weeks into Lamisil, I developed the ‘mysterious’ eye disorder known as blepharitis. I also had constant anxiety and depression regarding my skin, until it became all around anxiety and depression, and I just felt hopeless about life. I finally decided to try a Candida detox and within 4 days my eyes have improved dramatically—by about 35-40% I’d say. I was astonished, considering the condition is considered incurable and only mildly treatable, and so needless to say, I decided to keep up with the regiment. When I put all the pieces together, it looked like this: *moccasin athlete’s foot on feet and hands *yeasty groin area/itchy anus *late-onset oral thrush * the fact that I had been on long rounds of antibiotics within the last two years * the fact that I had been using oral contraception for the past 2.5 years *blepharitis * extreme mental imbalance; anxiety, depression, brain fog (that I’m only just now coming out of!) And when I looked at everything, I knew I had a Candida problem. So I am in this thing for the long haul, as I want my life back! I am planning to go to Japan in August, and want my gut to be as healthy as possible. I am worried about maintaining a Candida-savvy diet there, so if anyone has any advice it would be greatly appreciated! By August, however, I will have been 5 months into my new diet, so I’m hoping things will be easier. On a final note, should I start to see an improvement in my really tough-to-tackle moccasin fungal infections? I have never seen a fungus or bacteria take such root in my body, it seems like it’s here to stay, and that would be awful 🙁 I am still taking the Lamisil while I’m detoxing, and I am going to get a supplement to deal with die-off symptoms, but should I discontinue the use of Lamisil, or will it still be helpful at this point? Thanks for reading, and for any advice you can give! It feels so good to know I’m not alone. -Amanda"
1,Vegan Catlady,98,"Im not qualified to respond to your issues since I have not personally experienced most of them, but I can attest to diet being a player in my recovery. My original diet was never bad (medication induced candida) but choosing certain foods with antifungal qualities has been a big deal. I encourage you to do alot of reading, especially of other people’s experiences, so that you can get an idea of different ways to handle your problem. A big problem I notice for first-timers, ME INCLUDED at first, is that we think there is only one way to do this. Then we try it, follow it to the letter, and when it doesnt work, we feel hopeless,tired,and scared. The reality is that all of us is different, and what works for one may not be what works for another. Otherwise, you would see alot of “im cured!” stories, and I can tell you there aint. With that said, I would plan to be on a restrictive diet in Japan and just hope that it doesnt come to that. I understand its very possible to be cured in 5 months, but have a plan in place incase you need more time. Realistically, it takes most people longer, in some cases years, and that is not a bad thing as long as there is progress. The one thing im learning is that this needs time above all else. There is no magic pill that takes the place of time unfortunately."

Since my first serious candida cleanse in 2012 they have improved enormously – to put in into perspective I used to have to use eyedrops every hour at least when I was working on the computer now sometimes I go through a whole day without using them. I’ve also bought an air purifier for my bedroom and I find that helps enormously too, especially now when the pollen count is high."
0,millerd13,99,"I am writing this narrative not only to document the illness that I had but to point out how the medical profession caused this illness and then basically refused to help me get over it. The refusal and even denial that Candida overgrowth was an actual condition or disease was confusing, depressing, and disheartening.  I have been having symptoms for 6-7 years (maybe much longer?). The symptoms slowly built up and got worse over the last two years. Most symptoms were not severe enough to keep me bedridden so I continued to work and live my life but all the time not feeling good. Some days were worse than others.  Symptoms over that period and especially over the past year have been among others: fatigue, malaise, headaches, body aches, muscle aches, sore joints, burning eyes, itchy skin, bloating, gas, diarrhea, stomach cramps, inability to concentrate, fuzzy brain, waking up with hangover feelings, sugar craving, alcohol intolerance, sinusitis, Ebstein Barr Virus (spring/summer 2012), hypertension, poor sleep, frequent infections like colds and flu (where in the past I prided myself in almost never getting sick). The above symptoms have been persistent, some on and off and on again, and sometimes mild other times moderate. At first I thought that some of this was due to allergies that had been getting worse so I came to Dr. #1 and between her prescriptions, herbal remedies, and NAET acupuncture my allergies got much better (10% of what they were). Although allergy symptoms were much less, I still had these other symptoms and they progressively got worse this past winter and spring even though very little allergies. I started to feel even worse the spring of 2012 with a low grade fever and sore throat as new symptoms and tried to get in to see Dr. #2, my primary physician and tried to get in to see Dr. #1 but since neither were available I saw two different PAs at the clinic. They thought I had an infection so gave me antibiotics. Those didn’t work so they changed them. I was taking them for about 8 weeks and kept trying to get them to test me for other things but didn’t have any luck. I had so many antibiotics that I developed Thrush. I happened to be at my allergist appt. and she finally agreed and tested me for all sorts of infections and allergies and SHE discovered I had EBV. I had that from March through August of 2012.  Once over this I still had these bothersome symptoms. I went back to Dr. #1 and she sent me home with an O2 monitor overnight. She discovered that I had low oxygen levels so sent me to Dr. #3. He thought that some of these symptoms were connected to sleep. Had a sleep study and was diagnosed with still having severe sleep apnea. (I was diagnosed with apnea seven years earlier and had surgery of uvulaectomy, adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, to stop the apnea but there was never a post-surgery sleep study. Dr. #3 put me on a BiPap machine in April and eventually on 2.5 L. of oxygen in June, which I am continuing to use. Some of the headaches and some of the brain fuzziness have become less common but it did fix the hangover feeling I was waking up with. I sleep better too. BUT…most of the other symptoms continued.  I found a book that described the continuing symptoms I have been having: The Body Ecology Diet by Donna Gates and found that I probably have a severe Candida overgrowth infection. On her questionnaire/test if you score over 140 you most likely have an infection and I scored 418. It mentions the overuse of antibiotics as part of the cause, so here is what my history is. •	lots of antibiotics as a child – no details available •	8 or so years ago took 3 or 4 antibiotics for over 18 months for enlarged prostate •	last year before diagnosed with EBV I was given three wide spectrum antibiotics that did no good but did give me a Thrush infection in my throat. (Candida) The book suggested that if you think you may have a Candida infection to try the Body Ecology Diet for a few days and see what happens. I conducted an exhaustive search and read everything I could about candida and treatments. After doing this research I went ahead and accepted the recommendation and started the diet. The diet is basically a diet that starves out the Candida by cutting out all sugar, dairy, and carbs. I started the diet on Sept 29 and the next few days had worsening symptoms of all the listed symptoms above and felt like I had a very bad flu for 6 days. On Oct 5 (this is 2013) I was starting feeling a bit better. The research predicted this and called it a Herxheimer die-off reaction. This is the day I also started one new symptom with a rash on my ankles that spread to most of my body below my shoulders, especially in the armpits, groin, feet and ankles. It became very itchy. Two complete days of no sleep sent me to get help again. I went to Dr. #1 again and to my surprise she said she did not know anything about Candida and could not help me in any way. There was no offer to do some research and get back with me….no offer to send me to a specialist or anything. I was VERY discouraged since it seems like the medical profession caused some of my problems and now they won’t help me. She did suggest I go to a dermatologist (Dr. #4) I did and he gave me a Kenalog shot and was a bit encouraged that he recognizes candida infections and a few others that could cause my symptoms but the only treatment that works is to stick to the diet. So…. the rash went away after about 2 weeks. Many of the old symptoms lessened but the general malaise and energy problems continued along with headaches and stomach cramping. I went through different symptoms for 2 months….my lungs had a weird mucous that I coughed up for a while, my bones ached for a few days, some days I woke up with hangover like feelings that stayed the whole day.  I lost 20 lbs. in 20 days and a total of 30 lbs. I lost quite a bit of muscle mass loss, along with almost every ounce of body fat. I upped my protein and the weight loss has slowed but no weight gain. Here is my basic diet: I am drinking a 16 oz. glass of water when I wake in the morning, then finishing at least four more throughout the day. breakfast – a large 4 egg omelet with 2 cups of cut up zucchini, poblano, jalapeno, and onion, and a quarter of a pound of sausage and 2 cups of fresh spinach sautéed.  lunch – either a large salad and a fish filet or a smoothie with celery, lettuce, avocado, granny smith apple, kefir, protein powder, and Super Green additive with lots of nutrients including fermented algae and land veggies dinner – at first it was a small meat portion (chicken, beef, pork, or fish) and now a large portion with a large green salad and sautéed vegetables. I add quinoa and red skinned potatoes occasionally. for snacks I am eating almonds and cookies made with almond flour and stevia, along with celery and peanut butter, and anything else I can find in the refrigerator. About 4 months into this diet I felt like I was stuck and was not improving any more. I worried that I was not healthy in this diet so I went to Dr. Skee and had a physical with blood tests, urine tests, etc. They came out just fine and showed that I was healthy but I was not feeling good. I talked with a nutritionist from El Paso who prescribed a comprehensive regime of high quality herbal supplements that are designed to help get rid of the candida and toxins and rebuild the gut to a healthy condition using holistic herbs. This was very effective and has helped to get me closer to the cure.  About a month ago I started to feel better and started to have some energy returning. I felt well enough to get some work done outside. Unfortunately the combination of having an inflamed gut for so long and the quick weight loss can cause a hernia. I started having some lower gut pain and what felt like bad constipation pain and thought that the candida was returning but finally found the lump of an inguinal hernia. It was very very discouraging at first because I had been through enough as it was but I finally realized that this means the candida recovery is further along than I thought. I was scheduled for surgery a week later (April 24 2014) and have asked that no oral antibiotics be used so I don’t undo the rebuilding of the gut I have worked so hard at.  The surgery by Dr. #5 went well at first, outpatient and back home that afternoon. The tough part was the 1pm check in time for the surgery and I could not have any form of food or liquids since midnight. The next day I felt pretty good but that afternoon I started having severe pain that stretched from my rib cage and upper stomach to my left testical. The pain got progressively worse and I passed out trying to urinate so my wife took me to the ER. I was evaluated and Dr. #5 came in about midnight and orders were given to admit me and to insert a tube through my nose and into my stomach to suction out all the gas building up. They described that my gut just shut down and did not have any or enough peristaltic contractions to push food and gas through the system. The pressure of the gas caused the severe pain. My determination is that the candida inflamed my gut, the hernia made it worse and my digestive system simply gave up. I had to be given demoral to control the pain. Did not sleep at all but Dr. #5 kindly discharged me fairly early at 11AM.  The next day after getting discharged I was very sore…all muscles in my body were sore when waking but got better. Pretty strong pain in my left testicle and after showering I noticed it is a bit swollen but very purple. Things seem to be working fairly well with a couple of bowel movements but very painful. The next day I was in a great deal of pain when waking with half of the pain from the incision area and half from the testicles. Now both testicles are dark purple and it is spreading to my penis.  So….now it is the end of April, over 7 months into this. I have lost too much weight and am not gaining it back. Most candida symptoms have stopped. The hernia may be inflaming my gut and has set my recovery back some but this should get better after recovery from surgery. I am looking forward to healing from the surgery and being able to continue getting well after this hernia setback.  I am still shocked, dismayed, and downright pissed off at how the medical profession caused my condition but then almost totally refused to help me. My pulmonologist when I told him what was happening laughed me out of his office (I left in disgust). The only medical professionals that have admitted that they think candida overgrowth is a real infection (AMA does not recognize it as a disease) were Dr. #4 the dermatologist that I went to and Dr. #5, my surgeon for the hernia. He was shocked that none of my doctors recognized candida as a disease and said he has seen books, internet info and has known people who have suffered from it. This whole situation has left me not wanting to go to any doctor for anything, after all I have diagnosed myself, treated myself, and am getting better. But what do I do when I HAVE to go to a medical professional? Who do I trust? Very very frustrated……"
1,raster,99,"I personally think you’ve got the wrong idea that this is all candida by itself and its a complex of problems (co-infections) and not just this or that by itself. For instance, what compromised you in the first place? Why do you have candida and others do not? The answer for me was specific organs stopped working properly, likely impaired by heavy metals and prior use of antibiotics. If your thyroid is damaged then your shield to your immune system is impaired, and so your body was never able to fight anything off to its fullest ability. You are looking for diagnosis via the western medicine route. The only problem with this is there isn’t a single drug out there that can treat you. Doctors prescribe medications and the only medications available to fight yeast are prescription antifungals (diflucan, flucanazole) and prescription probiotics. The medical industry does not make much money off of diflucan…even if you got diflucan it might not work. You likely are infected by multiple things at once including viruses, microbes, parasites, yeast, bad bacteria, etc. So its just not one thing. If you become constipated it benefits all of these… What worked best for me was to heal holistically addressing multiple organs at once. So I healed my thyroid, adrenals, liver, intestines, brain, etc. all at the same. It has worked great for me but it costs lots of money. Naturopaths are the only type of doctor that heal this way. I also think your diet is a major part of the problem for your current health. You are simply not eating enough. Diet: -Breakfast: Omelette -Lunch: salad -Dinner: meat and starch and veggies. -Snacks (atleast you are snacking but not enough likely) I would try improving your diet and start eating 3-4 course meals and start rotating a bunch of foods. I would not consume eggs as often as you are because from my experience, when removing eggs, you’ll heal a lot faster because eggs protect the yeast. We’ve also discussed kefir a number of times and from my experience, you can heal faster without kefir. Goats milk kefir is a ton better/healthier than cows milk. Teff has great weight gain properties. Additionally, from my experience, potatoes, quinoa and peanut butter should not be consumed on the diet if you want to get better. Potatoes are high in starch and sugar, quinoa is a problematic grain that is hard tod igest, and peanut butter is too high in mold. Buckwheat groats are a good quinoa replacement, (non-roasted) almond butter is a good peanut butter replacement, and rutabega is a good potato replacement. Roasting the nuts removes the nutritional properties of them. What supplements are you currently taking and have you tried SF722 and HMF neuro? Sounds like the nutritionist is the closest thing to an ND you can find in your area so I think its the best route to go. If you want proper diagnosis I would consider the candida immune complex test that dvjorge recommends and/or some of the genova/metametrix tests: http://www.candidaplan.com/store/Candida-Testing/ I recommend finding someone who has treated this over and over for like 20-30 years and then you’ll get the best results without wasting the money. -raster"
0,Nowhere,100,"So it’s almost my 2 year anniversary of having IBS, so I feel like having a vent about it. 2 Easters ago I was feeling depressed and had a binge on chocolate. The next day I noticed I wasn’t feeling too good, and by the next week I still wasn’t feeling good, I was getting fatigued, had stomach cramps and farting too much. So then I visited the doc and realized quite quickly that he was out of his depth and not helpful at all. About a month goes by and I’m feeling terrible so I visit a foreign entity known as a natropath at this stage. She puts me on the gaps diet and tells me some useful information about bacteria, my gut, and the state of the food industry and my mind is blown! Unfortunately after many visits to the natropath I realize she has no cure for me either, she has helped by informing me and given me some good pointers, but she has also tried to leech as much money out of me as she can long after her usefulness expired. Also I am still not in control of my symptoms and have to quit my job. As a bum I discover fodmaps and tweak my diet and low and behold I have found a way to manage my symptoms! I have both Candida and fodmaps issues, so I must combine both the diets together and exclude an awful lot of foods but its worth it. Now I’m back at work and have things under control. I still lose control quite often, and I find the workload of having to prepare my own special meals takes its toll. BUT I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR IBS! I have learnt what real food is, learnt about life and spirituality and have felt pride in my ability to stand up to this challenge. I am suffering and find life pretty hard but I am doing my best to enjoy the journey. I am actually following a program called Nutritional Balancing Science to try and cure my symptoms, as it offers a new unique and comprehensive approach but it is not easy to follow. Also I have attained a lot of perspective from my pain, it has made me realize that even amidst all this misery I can find meaning and value in life and be thankful for all the blessings I have."

2,spectrum,100,"Hi Nowhere Congratulations on feeling good 🙂 I have suffered from IBS for over ten years and am still trying to find resolution. I have been on the candida diet for 2 years and it helped so much for the past 18 months but now I am slowly going back to my old symptoms. I was on the fodmapdiet many years ago (2010?) and found no relief, but I do recall not following it strictly. I was still gorging on bad foods and not broadening my vegetables. I was just cutting things out. I also recall not cutting out dairy. The candida diet has helped me to try so many new foods. I was wondering if you could supply more information as to what you do eat with both diets combined? Just a few details, like your regular eating habits? Any info would be appreciated. Like you I have exhausted so much money on specialists, naturopaths, dietitians etc. I’m currently seeing a gastro dr but he is medicating me with colofac (anti spasmodic) and an array of laxatives. Thanks & congrats again"
3,Nowhere,100,"Ok so I dont feel good 24/7 lol. There are so many things that can upset me, and I believe these upsets slow and stop your healing process so you needa find that plateau otherwise your going to be stuck in the mud. Anyways when it comes to combining fodmaps and candida diets it isn’t much fun > < but like I said, you can offset the pain and frustration of having a limited diet by adding extra love to your meals ^ ^. So I typically eat Bok Choy, Silverbeet/Chard, Kale, Cabbage (go easy), Broccoli (causes some problems), round/flat beans and Bean Sprouts (occasionally), and there are some more veg I can eat but their not in season yet like Rutabaga. Also you can eat Nightshades like Tomatoes Eggplant and Capsicum, and summer squash like Zucchini and Supermarket squash, but I only eat these very occasionally, because they are toxic and very yin which means they slow your metabolism and can cause joint pain. Then I eat some meat with every meal because I need that protein, cant have any carbs : / best meat is Lamb, Chicekn, Turkey, Eggs, Venison, Sardines, and Beef (occasionally) no Pork unless you like parasites. Seafood is full of mercury so you should only eat like 100g of a small fish (the smaller the better) every second day Sardines are the best and most nutritious. Beef has been bred to just spam milk and its not very healthy these days. Try eat organic. And also eat mono meals, I.E. One veg, one protein, little spice/fat. Just keep it simple, listen to your body and try to be gentle with your upset tummy. Oh and meat is easier to digest raw. The outside needs to be cooked to kill surface bacteria but if your lamb/beef/venison is fresh and its a tender cut eat it rare, also eggs shouldnt be overcooked. Always cook anything dangerous the whole way through but dont overcook. Be careful and make sure you dont eat any pink chicken. I suggest just going onto http://www.drlwilson.com"

She said I was probably suffering from a leaky gut hence the painful episodes I was getting and the non ability to absorb vitamins anymore which was why I was feeling so Old and tired and dry and depressed my sleeping was irratic , so for a week I have followed the diet religiously cutting out everything she said I was intollerant too plus the other stuff you cant eat on this diet . First week has shown signs of improvement already my itchy skin is not so itchy I sleep better for the first time in ages , my cravings have reduced immensely I have more positivy admitedly, I do flagg due to the strictness of the diet leaves you bit tired but am finding more and more about my self and how much you are what you eat >"

A few days later it receded, but on the OTHER leg, another purple welt! This went on for a week or so (3-4 welts,never together, always on opposite legs) and I went to the clinic. Not knowing what it was,they prescribed me 3 different antibiotics, and then gave me ANOTHER one a few days later when I couldnt tolerate one of them. I took them for about 4 days before I got so sick from them I begged to be off them. Coincidentally, my tests came back the same day and I had NO infection! They found a name for the welts that show up on only the front of legs and opposite ones ( I cant remember and wish I could), only that people with severely compromised immune systems get it. Like people with HIV.) I was tested for many scary diseases, and they came up negative. After this experience, I couldnt eat normal for about 8 months. Everyday was acid reflux, I couldnt swallow sometimes since my throat would close up from it, and even sipping water would trigger a heaving episode. I lost a lot of weight. I saw a digestion specialist, and after only 10 minutes with me (and hundreds of dollars later) she said heres a prescription (an 80$ one) you might have to take it the rest of your life. Cant tell yet. I might mention here that my diet was not vegan, but super clean. I didnt eat much junkfood, and I wasnt a regular drinker. Maybe you could call it paleo-like. Anyway I never took the meds. I was getting localized candida attacks and didnt know at the time that it was probably throughout my body, so I was casual with treatment because it would keep getting better. Then I went vegan and could eat again! Anything I wanted, NO REFLUX! Not even occasionally! I was still having candida attacks until I was told that fat in my diet was not letting sugar get absorbed quickly and made it circulate in my blood longer than it ought to,triggering candida. So I removed all overt fats. Its been about 1 1/2 years since I went vegan, and the attacks still come and go. Yesterday was the worst, I had a “hangover” so bad that I went a little insane and totally freaked out. Screaming,yelling,paranoia, headache and severe “drunkeness”. I kid you NOT, I thought I was going to die. I have an appointment with my doctor in a few days. Until then, I eat advils to help the headaches. Still super dizzy/hangover. Eyesight blurry. Itchy all over. Fearful of any liquid that isnt just plain water. I eat a diet now that is not friendly to candida, but the day before yesterday I was eating crackers and cookies, just because of the holidays. I paid HUGE for it. A banana the next morning set me off drunk-feeling and I couldnt string 5 words together. Knowing im not alone here is what is keeping me from going postal on that clinic from years ago. Please someone tell me this isnt forever and that I will someday go back to eating sugar again."

The so called ‘hormone free’ milk is usually even worse than the normal milk, since antibiotics is being used as a hormone replacement. Dairy has been praised by our governments because of milk industry lobbyists. It is unnatural to drink someone else’s mother milk. The majority of the population is allergic to animal milk. Vegetable milks are much better. The reason why we started drinking milk is because it can be very beneficial in case of famine.Vegan Catlady;52615 wrote: After doing alot of detective work, it occurred to me that last year’s blood test showed that my hemoglobin was within range but the lowest on the scale.Literally.

So I began researching links to iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin D deficiency, and candida. There are doctors who believe that if you don’t eat meat, you basically die. Obviously this is completely retarded. You can be perfectly healthy on a vegan diet. Vitamin D deficiency is quite normal when you have candida. Most people here will have serious vitamin D deficiencies. I also have a small insufficiency (19.6 ng/ml). Luckily vitamin D3 supplements are very cheap and it is very hard to overdose with it. Doctors say that your vitamin D is only related to your sun exposure, but that’s total rubbish. If your liver is broken, you won’t absorb much vitamin D. Although I live in a country with a rainy climate, I have a very pale skin so I should have lots of vitamin D. My hemoglobin levels are normal (15.2 g/dl), but my leukocytes are low (3080/µl), my lymphocytes are high (41.6/µl) and my ferritin is low (33 µg/l) (probably the iron stores you were talking about). Low ferritin apparently can really deprive your immune system, since it is essential for a descent thyroid function. All these deficiencies should be resolved once the candida problem is fixed, unless you have another underlying disease. I’m going to my specialist within about a month. I’m going to ask specifically if my ferrotin levels have changed. (I’ll be on the diet a good 7 months by then.)Vegan Catlady;52615 wrote: Decided to experiment with coconut oil.

Coconut oil is one of the strongest and best antifungals and it’s a type of antifungal your candida will not likely be able to get resistant against.

I try to only use sources that dont have alot to gain from my attention to them. Some of your advised reading has info on the web, for that I am very grateful. I also look for patterns in other people’s experiences.  I notice that almost everyone that eats low-carb since having candida stays low carb….or else! This is both horrifying and repulsive to me.  I have never been more unhappy and unhealthy than when I was low-carb,thinking I was helping my family’s diabetes. Turns out, once I took one family member off a lowcarb diet and put her on a balanced, high carb diet, she went off shots and now only needs the lowest dose glypozide to maintain. Doctor thinks she can be off that soon, too,if she wants to . I have a feeling this is going to be alot of experimenting."

7,Vegan Catlady,101,"After hours and hours and hours of research (and many fights with significant other over my hours) I have come to a new perspective. Everyone has experienced knowing that they dont have all the answers to whatever they are researching but they know when when something doesnt resonate or feel right.  They may not have the reason WHY it doesnt resonate, but something causes a flag to go up. Thats the gut telling you there must be more to whatever your researching. Anyhoo, my biggest problem with everything I have read on the forum and on the candida website is that there is no definitive reason this happens to people with healthy immune systems. Simply saying its sugar-over-consumption never ever felt correct. I know people that live only on sugar (not processed,silly,but fruits and veggies). This would be epidemic in those communities,and its not. So my research is fueled in the WHY this happened to me, because I have never had more energy than I have the last 8 months, and I cant remember the last time I got sick. I simply dont get sick….and im in the company of school children all the time. Who are sick. lol. I know my past 8 month diet has been considered by low-carbers to be exceptionally “high-carb”. Not because I eat candy or sugar, but because I DONT eat meat or dairy. This translates as high carb, and I get that, but those foods are WHOLE,with tons of fiber and dense nutrition. I say dense because when you eat as much as I do, even less than par veggies have to be imparting nutrients if your eating pounds of them. Not only wasnt I on caffeine for 8 months, but I was hyper and having 2-3 bowel movements a day. I didnt “do” junk because I was too full on the good stuff. So then I ask myself “if things were so great, then how did this happen?” No question I was indulging on the holidays with foods that should not be in anyone’s body,lol. Cookies, a donut, crackers,ect. Not in abundance, but the holiday for us was like 5 days long, so in the healthiest person’s gut, the yeast would be higher than normal. But this shouldnt be a problem yet, because your immune system should handle the excess yeast eventually and you would come into balance. People can indulge and NOT have problems with yeast…. the body is smart.High levels of yeast isnt a yeast problem until your body decides it cant get rid of it and bring it into balance. I think with me, there might be the possibility that it was never the temporary indulging…I asked myself, what did I do different before my first attacks? One thing I did different was that my meals were less raw on the holidays and more cooked. So what,right? I added in ridiculous amounts of garlic,cayenne, herbs, and everything including the goodies were spiced- cinnamon, cloves, ginger…ect. It hit me today that the stuff that CHANGED over the holidays was that anti-yeast foods were in abundance in my diet suddenly. Why would that make me feel sick, instead of better? Obviously die-off makes someone feel sick…but since I wasnt suffering before adding the antifungals in my diet then WHY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CANT I EAT SUGAR WITHOUT SUFFERING LIKE IM DYING NOW??? My newest thought is that if your yeast is high…and the body is still in the process of coming into balance…and you suddenly hit it with a flood of anti-fungals,thats when the yeast says “really? you want a piece of me?”  and changes into its fungal form and becomes nastier than if you had just let the body handle it. Im not saying someone with health issues would have come into balance naturally without boosting the immune system…but I dont have health issues. This honestly shouldnt be an issue for me. I have read that eating lots of Biotin (feeds yeast?) changes the fungal form back into yeast, where you can bring it into balance again. I would love for more info on this idea specifically. The idea is that you dont want to kill yeast, you just want it to stay yeast and not go fungal. Be patient; im still learning. Low carbing the rest of my life is not an option."

Im so sorry you havent found your trigger yet. I feel your frustration, not knowing is worse than having a clear path,no matter how rough. I cant imagine why this shows up after feeling so incredibly good. I know there must have been a trigger. Im kind of looking into a pattern with (of all things) hair-coloring. My hair is black and lapis blue, and unless you also color your hair, you dont realize that we inadvertently ingest these chemicals while in the shower,in the rain… Im really vibing with my issue being the transition of the yeast to the fungal stage, and what is triggering that transition, because I know I have always had yeast since I have had antibiotics from an early age. Especially since my last round of antibiotics 3 years ago was taking 3-4 different ones at the same time. That probably sealed my fate right there. And now my 12 yr old is going through all this too…and just got off antibiotics recently. Candida is a nightmare. I guess the gift here is that your attention is now on health and well being, which can be huge if your like me and had times where you worked 80 hours a week to make ends meet. I abused myself because you think there is no other way, but candida says you have to find another way because stress aint your friend,lol."

So far, I haven’t found anything. I hope to do a mercury/methylation test soon. What I wanted to add to these comments is there is likely even further causes than what he mentioned here. I would look at some of the following: -GMO foods -Fluoride and chemicals Combined with what he mentioned and constipation. When you are constipated these toxins and food you eat ferment in the gut. When this occurs over and over for years or longer, this slowly benefits the bag bugs in the body and contributes to overall toxicity. You are at a critical point catlady and basically your “swimming pool” is full of toxins. When you throw crap into the swimming pool, it overflows causing your symptoms. I don’t know what you are planning as far as diagnosis/testing, but most western doctors won’t be able to treat this. They don’t know much about digestive disorders, yeast overgrowth, etc. and cannot treat it because there isn’t a single drug you can take that will cure you. Western doctors prescribe drugs and do testing, and that’s about it. The are some Rx antifungals out there that can bring relief but you have to basically give your doctor studies to read about candida in order to convince them to prescribe these drugs (for most doctors and not all). Things I would consider testing include histamine levels and allergens. You could have high histamine levels and this would indicate a need to address this via diet. If you have allergies, you could take allergy shots to get over the allergies. A naturopath could reverse them too. Then I would look at liver enzyme levels to see if this is elevated. This could explain a lot of your anxiety problems, etc. All of these tests start to add up in $$$ and don’t typically give you a full diagnosis of yeast overgrowth. For a positive diagnosis for yeast overgrowth, you would need to do some of the metametrix or genova diagnostics tests and these could look at potentially other things like parasites, sibo, h.pylori, etc. http://www.candidaplan.com/store/Candida-Testing/ There are a lot of things that are similar to yeast overgrowth in symptoms and I would not rule them out. I already mentioned parasites, sibo, h.pylori, etc. but it could also be a little bit of your liver, thyroid, adrenals, slightly damaged…or elevated histamine levels. Eastern holistic doctors are completely different and good ones don’t need to do testing typically. They’ll focus on healing your liver and various organs all together at the same time. They’ll make a detox plan and tell you what foods are best etc. But it costs way more… Dvjorge has a good post about a study/article you should share to your doctor about yeast but I don’t know the link to the post. -raster"

14,Vegan Catlady,101,"Thanks raster 🙂 Watching Dr Morse has me thinking of my adrenals and my kidneys/liver constantly,hahaha. In my sleep even. When I have extra money, I want to try building up my adrenals and moving my lymph with some of his formulas. I intuit my histamine is high…I even feel a weird feeling in my sinuses after eating something with sugar in it. Bananas were my attack triggers, and I felt a histamine reaction from them. But you know, I was never allergic to anything in my whole life…it doesnt resonate with me that I would over-night be allergic now,unless yeast is making me sensitive,you know? I have been mostly raw vegan for over a year, but vegetarian before that. I stick with organic when it comes to the “dirty dozen” food list. Clean eating for so long (no meat,no dairy, mostly organic, smoothies with full-fiber whole foods,ect.) that even the candida diet isnt as clean as my diet was. So with this said, I have a blood panel coming back to me this week.  I look forward to sharing the results, as I assume it will be all kinds of wacky! I started taking a multivitamin with iron in it ( I know, iron feeds candida…but im borderline anemic)2 days ago, and I took 1000 mg biotin today too. I heard taking both those things may make matters worse, but I cant imagine getting more deficient than I already am. I should probably wait for the results of the test…but its hard not trying new things. Anything for relief. I should see if my liver enzymes are elevated too when the test comes back. Hopefully this will shed light on my triggers. If not, im back to the drawing board and I will NOT be happy."

But only for 18 days I’ve been following Able and Raster’s protocol, since doing this I have for the first time started to notice slight improvements. What I have done to help reduce any more trial and error tribulations is to firstly identify what I am allergic to, stick to the diet and finally, no more “motivational cheat moments”. For some this may come across as a bit over the top, but from what I’ve learned so far is that I am extremely allergic to sugar and can’t afford to go backwards anymore as I’ve been living in the shadows for too long now, I was not showing any signs of improvement with the less cautious attitude of eating only tiny bits of sugar, as somehow it just all added up and with the brain fog it was generally very difficult to keep track of everything. I find it takes a very long time to actually realise how long you are accidentally setting yourself back or compromising your recovery when your doing this diet and supplements as die off and inflammation are fairly constant and similar in my situation. Doing it in this fashion will give me the confidence that I am going forward rather than back or remaining stationary for that matter! I have developed over time the confidence and discipline to stay on the diet and tackle this candida and gut once and for all! After 7 days of following A&R’s protocol I was starting to notice improvements in adrenal stress, cognitive function and pain in muscles, which are intrinsically linked to my mood and behaviour. But, on the 8th day I went to have further tests: Adrenal Stress Profile, Gut Fermentation Profile, Protein Digestion & Metal Toxicity Levels. For one of the tests I was given a water solution with 5 grams of sugar in it, since then all my symptoms came back, so therefore have had to start again. Grrr.. Deep breath a few times…stiff upper lip…smile and move on!  Those improved symptoms havent quite returned yet even 8 days later but the reason I believe is, is that I am taking more antifungals now, so time will tell, but mostly I am confident with the route I am going there isn’t much which can set me back.  Due to my VERY low stomach acid and I imagine overwhelmingly unbalanced flora, as a result I believe I have malabsorption. My backstory about Brain Fog: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst5597_Brain-Fog-Sufferers-and-My-Story.aspx My supplements: – Vitamin C – Solgar (3000 to 5000mg per day) – Vitamin D3 – Healthy Origins 1x 5000iu per day) – Megaflora 20 Billion Probiotic – 1x per meal – Zinc Picolinate – Solgar (1x 22mg per day) – Magnesium Glycinate – Nutri (3x per meal) – Fresh Flax seed Oil 3 6 9 – Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate – Solgar (450mg per day) – 1 a day Multivitamin & Mineral – Biocare – Liver Support Complex – Terra Nova (2 per day) – Milk Thistle – Solgar (1x per day) – SF722 – Thorne Research (8-15 per day) – Bio-Gest – Thorne Research (1-2 per meal depending on meal) – Bio B12 – Thorne Research  – Swedish bitters (Once every so often to flush liver) – Nutrispore– Nutri (3x a day antifungal complex) – Nutri Whole Pituitary – Nutri (1 a day) – Nystatin – From Homeopath (1 spoon per day at night just before bed- Alternating with SF722) – Coconut Oil – Biona (2-5 spoons per day) – Neo Garlic One a day (One in the morning and one just before bed) Symptoms: – In the morning I get extreme dry burning sensation in throat which prolongs for few hours after waking – Rash on neck  – Ringworm on chest  – Severe Brain Fog – Constant feeling of die off or adrenals going mad – Moderate Hair loss (receding hair line)  – Mood swings – Severe irritability (Depending on antifungals as well) – Mild situational depression – Fatigue – Clicky joints  – Sore muscles – Lower back, calves and underarms especially – Constant gluey popping ears (like when you try and clear them from atmospheric pressure on a plane) – Itchy scrotum – Spots inbetween legs and on face Childhood problems:  – Constant ear aches and a few infections, was completely unable to go any further than a metre underwater without extreme pain from pressure in ear. – Had metallic taste in my mouth I remember for about 2-3 weeks as a child – Use to have nose bleeds very often, had nose quarterized 3 times. Problems Should I buy fulvic acid to help aid absorption? I dont feel I am supplementing well enough for my leaky gut, what would you reccommend? Slippery elm? Apart from kefir or yoghurt what would be a good way to ingest as much beneficial bacteria as possible?  (I guess i could double up on my Megaflora 20 mill?) I have no “snackfoods” and was thinking of pumpkin seeds as a good form, but wary it might feed the candida, any thoughts? Miscellaneous  My gut is reactive to pork, shellfish, gluten, starch, yeast, soy, sugar. Diet: Cabbage, Brussel Sprouts, Courgettes, Onions, Green peppers, Spinach, Lettuce, Rocket, green beans, Leeks Chicken, Duck, Salmon, Trout. Recent problems, but now rectified: wasnt digesting food so bought Thorne Bio Gest (with HCl, pepsin, pancreatin, and ox bile) stopped xylitol, pork, xylitol chocolate, nuts and beef. Moving forward: – Improve supplementation for healing of gut – Going to try and ingest more probiotics – Start eating big helpings of prebiotics – Not drink the kefir I made due to possible set back from sugar in it FYI I have just read “Gut and Psychology Syndrome” and by gosh it was a revelation for me, I recommend everyone to read it. The book stresses the importance of keeping your gut in good health in order to keep you healthy and functioning optimally and how if your digestive system isn’t working its likely everything else isn’t. You have to look at it as if your body is a factory line starting with your digestive system, if that messes up the first job, the rest of the organs will not be able to do a good job, as they were not designed to deal with the mess up the digestive system sent to them. The way I see the D system is that its the engine keeping us functioning normally because, if its not working, like if we have low stomach acid we wont be able to absorb nutrients for essential health. The gut flora is vital to build up your immune system, keep your brain working normally, and mainly as a way of protecting you from things such as candida. Some people especially caeserian or fed with bottled milk rather than breast fed are much more likely to be predisposed to these problems due to not receiving enough benefical bacteria in your gut as a child. So the moral of the story is keep the balance with bacteria and make sure you have enough stomach acid. Thanks for reading, JD"

3,1533jd,102,"Thanks Thomas for this insight, how thoughtful of you. I am going to look into this after I receive my results on Monday."
4,sittingbytheSun,102,"Thanks so much for your post, I can totally identify with your struggle. You asked about flora, I recently discovered the benefits of fermented veggies as a way to establish and rebuild flora in the gut. Foods such as kimchi and saurkraut are pretty excellent! I noticed changes in bowl output after only a few days of consuming. I noticed too that my severe chronic dry hair disappeared, overnight. My brain fog has drastically diminished as well, but I credit the garlic pill and wild yam pills that I recently started to take. I wish you much luck!"
0,Yuki,103,"I have decided to chronicle my journey with the awful entity that is candida, both for my own mental ease and for anyone who might gain comfort or insight through my writing. It started…when I was just a child. As a child I frequently experienced a variety of stomach related problems, from tummy aches, to gas and near constant constipation. They were largely overlooked because they never resulted in anything “serious.” At puberty I began experiencing a host of other problems, from dry skin to easy bruising, but it was all written off as “hormonal” spikes. Around age twelve I developed serious anxiety and depression, which we all thought to be heredity (mental health problems run rampant on both sides of my family.) It wasn’t even until I was fifteen that I discovered I was lactose intolerant. At age 16 I experienced my first yeast infection. It was persistent and returned multiple times, with the women in my life assuring me it wasn’t a big deal. My Mom admitted to it being a common problem for herself as a young woman. Antibiotics did nothing, and I eventually managed to “solve” the problem with the help of probiotics and garlic. Fast forward to four years later, me, age twenty. My depression is manageable with therapy, but I have a variety of dental related problems (always have, years of metal fillings) that I am waiting to get fixed when my insurance kicks in (just three months, thank goodness.) I decide to try welbutrin almost immediately after finishing a round of antibiotics for my gum infection. I am also eating a diet that, while healthy by my standards (a diet consisting of lots of vegetables, meat, grains, some soy) is also laden with sweets. With total financial independence, I frequently eat cookies, candy, pastries–anything and everything you can imagine. Then “it” begins to happen. First, I begin experiencing headaches (I blame the side effects from welbutrin), my skin has been dry for months (I blame it on the winter), and then I begin to develop a rash on my palms and feet (my doctor tells me it is “dermatitis” which my father also has–I blame it on genetics.) The rash comes and goes, but then, even worse, I begin experiencing random itching across my body. No irritation is present, but any given time my chest, back, and legs become intensely itchy. My body aches often, and the headaches become part of my daily life. Even worse, I develop extreme insomnia. While difficulty getting to sleep at a reasonable hour has always been difficult for me, falling asleep (or staying asleep) rarely poses an issue. Not any longer. The sleep itself becomes restless. Nightmares begin to creep in every manner of sleep I attempt–so intense that I wake up at least once or twice a night–in tears. My feet begin to sweat no matter the weather. My body feels dissatisfied no matter the temperature (either too hot, or too cold.) The bruising appears more frequently. The final straw, however, is the total decimation of my sex drive. I have always had a sexual healthy appetite–even above average–but it has slowly declined from age 19, something I assumed was a normal part of aging. Then, it decides to disappear altogether. After an entire month of feeling like between my legs is a dead-zone, I realize there must be something seriously wrong with me. I try google for all my symptoms: loss of libido, itchy skin, profuse sweating, headaches, nausea, constipation, forgetfulness, etc. I come back with only a few options: Lyme disease, cancer, hypothyroidism, or systematic candida. I decide to find a new doctor and make an appointment with someone who listen to me to rule out the other options (still pending) but I am almost immediately assured who the real culprit is. I know I cannot go on living this way, and in fact, I refuse to. I spend hours researching diets, methods, the madness. I accumulate lists of foods and symptoms. I realize things I blamed on other causes could be the candida as well: itchy ears, hemorrhoids, dry mouth, lower back pains, iron deficiency, cold/shaky, lethargy, and so many more. When I’m done researching, I decide to pack up all my old food, and start fresh. On Friday, Marth 28th, I begin my journey towards healthy living.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)"
1,Vegan Catlady,103,Looking forward to hearing you progress . Welcome to the forum 🙂
2,Yuki,103,"Thank you for your response. More posts will follow. Warning, as I do go into detail about bowel movements and much more. 03/28/2014 – 03/30/2014: The Cleanse I begin with a cleanse consisting of only fresh and lightly steamed vegetables, and at least eight glasses of water each day. I imagine it can’t be that difficult (I love vegetables! I’ve considered becoming a vegetarian multiple times.) Boy am I wrong. Day 1 – The first salad is delicious. The broccoli for lunch isn’t so bad. By dinner I never want to eat another green vegetable again. I am starved for starches and sugar. I spend hours scrolling through food on Tumblr, looking at everything I wish I could eat. While it is torture, it also helps me maintain some level of sanity. In addition to my veggies, I am take 2 probiotics with each meal. I soak each night in a hot bath with apple cider vinegar, and cease use of all soaps, shampoos, and conditions, less I throw off my pH balance further. I began squirting diluted ACV into my vagina, and sleeping with a clove garlic inserted inside along with a probiotic.  Day 2 – By the second day, there is noticeable improvement with my vaginal yeast infection, but I am already completely miserable. The thought of eating makes me want to gag. I am completely weak. At 12pm the postman rings the doorbell and I stumble down the steps to accept the package. It is my garlic capsules. A dizzy spell so intense occurs that I barely make it back of the steps. I feel entirely nauseous and fatigued. I sleep most of the day. That night the dizzyness has ceased. I do my usual soak but I cannot make a bowel movement. I use a needless syringe to stimulate my bowels with warm water and pass what appears to be watery black sludge. Around 12am I manage to eat some cucumber slices. All food cravings have ceased. I never want to eat anything again. Day 3 – Day 3 is more tolerable with the ability to eat meat looming in the horizon. I manage to eat 3 solid, albeit small meals. I attempt baked rutabaga fries for dinner and it is so disgusting I lose my appetite. I’m able to walk and move without dizzying spells. Again, no bowel movement without assistance. I soak again and head to bed. With the worst behind me, I am feeling marginally hopeful but largely depressed. The cravings have returned, and I feel entirely socially isolated. All I can talk about is how miserable I feel. Despite the addition of meat I feel no joy.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently!

3,Yuki,103,"03/31/2014 – Diet, Day 1  Meals: I have a large salad for breakfast and a cage free grass fed egg over easy. The egg tastes strange to me (I later realize it is due to its “organic” nature) and not nearly as satisfying as I’d hoped. I have chicken and broccoli for dinner. I try keeping the veggie/meat ratio to 60/40 and fail miserably. I figure eating more meat is better than eating less altogether. I’ve already begun losing weight. For dinner I have a salad with chicken in it.  Bowel Movements: 1 w/ Assistance  Libido: Non-existent. Orgasms 1/10.  Mental Health: Depressed. It is today that I realize this diet is not temporary, until I’m “better” but likely forever in some way, shape, or form. I cannot bear the thought.  Die-Off Symptoms: nausea, upset stomach, headaches, itchiness, constipation Supplements: 1 Candida Support Capsule & 1 Garlic Supplement with Breakfast and Dinner. Flaxseed Oil and Fish Oil with Lunch. 2 Probiotic pearls with each meal. Pau d’Arco & Chamomile tea with dinner. I cook only with coconut oil. Other: Tonight is the first night I attempt to soak in tree tea oil (added into my hot bath.) I add to much and stay in for too long resulting in a dizzying spell and patches of burning skin. It leaves to mark and I sooth the pain with coconut oil mixed with pau d’arco. I also want to take this time to list my available food choices: broccoli, radish, rutabaga, green beans, cauliflower, eggplant, garlic, coconut oil, limited amount of olive oil, apple cider vinegar, salt, pepper, fresh herbs, spinach, kale, zucchini, okra, chicken, eggs, turkey, and beef. I would also like to make note that I am no longer taking welbutrin or any medication or antibiotics. I have never been one to live life in half measures (hence my overindulgence in sweets) so I am excluding all forms of grains (including “safe” items like quinoa, brown rice, and coconut flour), nuts, produce, seeds, sweets, dairy (including plain yogurt), and coffee. I eventually plan to organic non-GMO produce and grass fed, cage/hormone free meat.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently!

4,Yuki,103,"03/1/2014 – 04/02/2014: Days – 2 & 3  Meals: I stick largely to chicken and eggs as my protein source for all of day 1 and two, and on day 3 I decide to make my own homemade broth. I boil 2 thighs in my crock pot on low for 24 hours, to get as many nutrients as possible. I add 3 diced celery stalks a third of a diced onion and several cloves of garlic. I have a “green” eggs (spinach blended with two eggs) and two pieces of gluten free, sugar free turkey sausage for breakfast. On day three I have the same with kale instead of spinach. I have the broth for lunch and dinner.  Bowel Movements: 1 With Assistance Libido: Orgasm at a solid 2, but could be a fluke. Still intense lack of interest. Mental Health: Day 3 is the most taxing, as I do not sleep at all the night before (bad idea.) I am exhausted and prone to moodswings the entire day. I bounce between extremely pessimistic and extremely optimistic in regards to my condition. I find a website where I can order grass fed, cage & hormone free meat, but am less excited at the cost. My hopes go up at finding various websites selling gluten free, sugar free treats (but still containing lots of “forbidden” ingredients) that I hope to one day be able to eat in moderation. The reality of almost never being able to eat normally is still setting in. Thinking about all the days I won’t be able to eat out with my friends, or meals with my family is crushing me. I buy myself the computer I have been saving up for for months which improves my spirits marginally. On day 3 a pregnant cat under a year old follows me into my apartment, and I decide to foster her until she gives birth and her kittens can find homes. It helps to pull me out of myself and distract me until it’s time for bed. Die Off Symptoms: dry, straw-like hair, mood swings, mental fog, forgetfullness, confusion, upset stomach, headaches. Ability to sleep through the night with minimal nightmares (only one, low-stress.) My skin seems to be clearing up. Itchiness on feet at night.  Supplements: 2 Probiotic Pearls with each meal. 1 mug of Pau d’arco tea with each meal. 1 Anti-Candida Support Capsule and Garlic Capsule with breakfast and dinner. Cayenne Pepper Capsules at lunchtime (to increase circulation) and flaxseed oil/fish oil.  Other: I would to let everyone know that the Candida Support Capsules contain a combination of herbal ingredients (Pau D’Arco, Black Walnut and Oregano Oil), Biotin (a B-complex vitamin) and Caprylic Acid (a naturally occurring fatty acid derived from plant oils). Kyolic Formula 102 herb and enzyme blend, contains a unique natural and synergistic combination Aged Garlic Extract, Ginger, Glucanase, Lipase and Protease On days 2 & 3 I soak in tea tree oil. On day 3 my all natural bath supplies arrives, consisting of: Dr. Bronner’s Magic Pure Soap in Lavendar and Tree Tea Oil, Biotin Shampoo, Argan Oil Conditioner, and Cinnamon Toothpaste. Still waiting on my Probiotic deodorant. On day 3 I decided to make up an “Anti-Candida Timeline” so I can be sure to progress at the pace that is best for me. Timeline:  March 28th – April 30 = Vegetable Cleanse March 31st – April 30th = Meats, Steamed Vegetables, Fresh Veggies April 15th – April 30th = Begin a parasite cleanse using Fresh Green Black Walnut Wormwood Extract, Organic Whole Psyllium Husks, and Bentonite. Introduce New (Better) Probiotics that dissolve in the gut as opposed to stomach. April 30th – May 7th = Introduce some Nuts and Seeds (Almonds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds) May 7th – May 14th = Reintroduce Yogurt (Plain Only) & some low sugar berries, and Begin Eating Green Shakes (Kale, Spinach, and Other Green Veggies with a small amount of green apples) w/ Mediclear. May 14th – May 21st = Slowly Reintroduce Some grain (quinoa, buckwheat, almond flour) and old foods (tomatoes, almond butter, small amounts of buckwheat pasta and other gluten free, sugar free foods) and attempt to make some bread with almond flour, as well as some no sugar lemon based treats. My goal is to be able to eat a very small amount of a sugar free, gluten free lemon based or coconut based cake for my birthday on May 22nd. From there on I will take small steps and experiment to see what my body can accept. I will also be switching to grass fed, free range meat at some point via this website.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently!

5,Yuki,103,"03/3/2014: Day – 4  Meals: At the realization that I am losing weight (something that my frame cannot take much of before dipping into unhealthy territory) I decide that I need to eat more, even if it is not the “correct” food. I’m still sticking to the diet protocol, so for breakfast I have my usual kale eggs with 2 small gluten free, sugar free, turkey links. For lunch I have leftover chicken brother (including garlic, chicken, celery, onion, and zucchini noodles) as well as two hard boiled eggs to fill me up. For dinner I have leftover “Shepherd’s Pie” which consists of ground turkey, greenbeans, and a layer of mashed cauliflower on top. I ditch the mashed cauliflower in favor of not gagging. Note: I know that I should be eating a 60/40 ratio of veggies and meat, but this was not filling me up, satisfying me, or helping gain weight. I am (and have been my entire life) extremely sensitive to foods I dislike. Rarely it is the taste itself, but many textures will inherently make me gag, or even vomit. I’ve come to realize these reactions are largely mental, but until I find a way to circumvent the issue I am stuck merely coping. I simply cannot eat foods I truly dislike or do not want, without gagging, vomiting, or triggering a stomach upset.  Bowel Movements: 1 without assistance! Hooray. Preceding the bowel movement was some moderate to extremely painful cramping, for about ten minutes. It dissipated after the BM. Despite the complications, I consider this a small success.   Libido: Orgasm seems elevated to a 3-3.5. I hesitant to call this an improvement, as it is so small and could easily be some other factor, like ovulation or the time of the month. Die Off Symptoms: whiteish tongue, foul breath, headaches, extreme fatigue (unable to work, take small walks), muscles completely sore, difficulty sitting in any position for too long, bad dreams, dry hair. Supplements: My supplement schedule has been updated as follows. -Breakfast & Dinner: 1 Candida Support Capsule, 1 Kyolic Capsule, 5 Drops of Lugol’s 2% Iodine/Iodide Solution. -Lunch: 1 Cayenne Capsule, Flaxseed Oil. -Additionally, I take one probiotic with breakfast, and 1 Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, and D3 pill with each meal. I also drink pau d’arco tea before bed. Other: I did not shower or apply coconut oil today. I plan on experimenting with making a new lotion with coconut oil, tea tree oil, and a small amount of Lugol’s tomorrow. My probiotic deodorant also came today. I am excited to try it! I also went ahead and ordered my new probiotic (THORNE RESEARCH – Bacillus Coagulans) as I feel that my current supplement is not doing much to help. I also haven’t been able to work (I work from home, luckily) throughout this whole process, and I am hoping I will be well enough by Monday to resume my full workload. I need the money, but the fatigue is making it hard. I also need to resume walking my dog (poor guy hasn’t been walked in a week.) Hopefully I am feeling stronger tomorrow! I hope everyone reading is feeling just as good as I am, if not better.Donate here to help me get Mercury-free and solve my systematic candiasis permanently! (Even $1 can greatly help my cause!)"
0,loverebel8,104,"Helloooooo! I just found out about candida last year after having about three or four back-to-back yeast infections last year that either the fluconzanole (sp) didn’t help or returned shortly after the treatment. A Google search about causes of recurring yeast infections lead me to the candida diet (and its variations). Prior to this revelation, I had already been eating more healthily for general well-being, however I would still indulge in cereal (my favorite food), cheese, cookies (especially Oreos, which in hindsight I realize that the yeast infections occured after a couple of Oreo binges), and the occasional Toaster Strudel. Generally, though, I ate healthily. After researching candida, I decided I try the diet because this last bout of a yeast infection survived two fluc. pills and has lasted 4 months (and counting). Because I was relocating across the country in a few months, I decided to wait until I moved to begin the diet. I didn’t realize exactly how complicated it would be to maintain the diet. The first time around, breakfast was pretty easy – 2 boiled eggs, sliced zucchini, and cherry tomatoes. To stave off hunger while I was on campus, I would eat Trader Joe’s unshelled sunflower seeds (prior to knowing anything about soaking or hearing that raw seeds were supposedly better than salted). Dinner was either chicken and broccoli or some kind of salad. At the same time, I was taking a Trader Joe’s detox set that cleansed the digestive system and the liver as well as provided fiber. I think I was doing well because the die-off systems came full force – light headedness/fainting and intense itching while I was asleep. After a couple of weeks, though, I noticed diminished symptoms and surprising energy; I didn’t feel the need to nap during or after class! I was living with a friend and decided that I would postpone the diet until I moved into my apartment in the coming weeks. I moved into my apt and since it didn’t come with a fridge, I bought a little bit of stuff to tie me over until I could procure a refrigerator. When I finally did go shopping, I bought all of the essentials I didn’t already buy during the first grocery trip – fresh veggies, ground turkey, frozen veggies, almond butter, ginger tea, etc. What I DIDN’T have was anything to take with me to class to stave off hunger and since I had since read that salted, not “raw” sunflower seeds were either not good for you or forbidden from the diet, I hadn’t bought anymore. I moved about a month ago and I am again back off of the diet. I go back home (across the country) this weekend for spring break but will be back on the diet full force upon my return. And that’s my story. If you all have any tips, tricks, or knowledge to drop on me, PLEASE feel free to do so. I think my main problem is eating while I’m at school. Although I only have one class that’s three hours long, the time in between breakfast and our 20-minute break leaves me ridiculously hungry and susceptible to runs to the nearby 7-11. I look forward to learning, learning, learning, and ultimately healing. Peace."
0,secretgarden,105,"I started taking an iron supplement last week, and yeast went crazy. I feel like I really need the iron, so will try to continue it but fight the candida. I’ve gotten bad about drinking Coke, and eating whatever I want, so I have lots of room for improvement. I have the Blessed Herbs colon-cleansing and internal cleanse kits, just haven’t been able to stop eating 🙁 to do the best cleanse. I guess I’m an emotional eater. Oh, and I just ordered/received Aqua Flora, which now am wondering if I should not use it. I thought if I started checking in with others dealing with this, I might have more success with a cleanse and better diet. I’ve browsed the forum a bit, look forward to reading more and getting to know you all better."
1,raster,105,"The cleanses don’t do much in terms of reducing candida numbers… The aqua flora likely won’t very well either. This is a long term battle, I tell most people to plan on a 6-18 month recovery to get over candida. -raster"
2,secretgarden,105,"Thank you, Raster. I think I’m in for the long haul. Since yesterday, I’ve been reading about turpentine & sugar. I even bought both today, but want to increase bowel action before trying. I’ll search here, bc I’ve forgotten results shared on this forum. I’m pretty excited to try it. Of course, I realize I must give up the obvious sugar-foods, and get my diabetes under control, foremost. So much of the battle is mental/emotional! I wonder how do you talk yourself out of those cravings?"
3,secretgarden,105,"BLEEHHHH!!!!!!! I just took turpentine in sugar cubes, and it was horrifically disgusting!!! Okay, forget that!!! Oh my gosh. BLEEEEEHHH On positive note, I did not drink Coke today! I had a sugar/sweet-free breakfast of eggs, kale, tomatoes, hot green decaf tea. Sugar/sweet free lunch of fish, potato, tea. Dinner of chicken, corn, noodles, water. That wasn’t so good, but still overall a much better day. Oh my goodness, the little belches are killing me, even after quickly gulping lemon water and eating some chicken. I read so many people’s experiences, and they all said how it tasted pleasant, good even. And I researched for the purest turpentine of recommended strength (boiling point), no additives. Well, forget this!!!! DOn’t try it!!! I hope I won’t throw up. That’s the real danger – of aspirating it. Now it’s in my body…agh….I regret this. Well, who knew. I wouldn’t have, without trying it myself. Ooh, baking soda will stop burps, yes??"
0,Zephyris,106,"Caught your attention didn’t I? 😉 It all started with a visit from my long distance relationship girlfriend. ( before that I had a course of antibiotics ) She spent the week with me after a few days I notices spots on my peewee which without a doubt the doctor said it’s candida for sure. But he never checked my tongue or anything else, he didn’t do a full checkup. After using the cream I noticed small improvement but then I was starting to have heart palpitation and almost feinting but keep in my mind I have Gluten Intolerance for a 2 years and still struggling with that diet. Not only that I’m a heavy consumer of energy drinks and I never eat milk products.( and I had to use a few antiobiotics treatments in my life, like 4+ times.) Every time I consumed an energy drink I thought I was gonna die from a heart attack, it never used to do this to me and I used to be able to drink them fine. So I decided to look up candida and one of the main symptoms is white tongue which I noticed I have. So I stopped consuming any or almost form of a sugar after 1 or 2 days I started feeling much better, no palpitation what so ever. Also months before I kept having a feeling that something is lightly strangling me in my throat and while going off sugar that almost disappeared. I’m like wow, sugar causes all that, I’m even losing weight which is so freaken awesome. I’m on a diet of probiotics yogurts and water, I havent felt this good in years and I used to have a milk intolerence thus why i didn’t eat to much milk products, it’s not giving me problems anymore after forcing myself to eat some. I had stopped using that cream on my peewee, just the change in the diet fixed that issue in 2 days. How insane is that! ——– Siberian Ginseng, Probiotics, Garlic, Peppermint/Cam. Tea = Does wonders. I only have heavy symptoms when I abuse sugar, I’m guessing my stomach is infected with yeast, probably my throat too considering the white tongue. But I have if I keep to this diet, it will stabilize my system. 27yo male. Thanks a lot for listening guys and girls 🙂 I appreciate any advice! edited: on another note, If you have to be sugar free and gluten free, it makes it twice as hard to find good food to indulge in to sustain yourself.

After a battery of expensive lab tests, my doctor said that I have “leaky gut syndrome” which is why I have Psoriasis. My liver and kidneys are overloaded and cannot get rid of the toxins. Therefore the next organ to clear the toxins is the skin. I was devastating because it took me two years to be diagnosed properly and at least have an idea on which direction to go. I was also diagnosed with Candida Albicans infection. i went on Diflucan and grapeseed extract to get rid of the the Candida. A month ago I underwent yet another costly test and I still have the infection. This time my doctor put me on a 3 month course of Nystatin. I found the Ultimate Candida diet plan and I am on the beginning of the second phase. I found that my Psoriatic lesions have been under control and the itching is getting less and less, I am learning a lot from this forum but have not quite read a lot of the posts. I am desperate to cure my candida infestation and know that once I get rid of it my Psoriasis will be cured as well. I am on a more restrictive diet because of my “leaky gut”. I cannot have dairy, gluten, certain kinds of vegetables and of course sugar because of it’s effect on the candida. I am hoping that this will not be a life sentence. It is daunting to say the least. A lot of times I do not know where to begin and which health issue I should address first, but unfortunately the 3 conditions are all related. I decided to tackle my candida infection. I am hoping that I am doing the right thing. I would very much appreciate any advise/ tips that may have worked for ou. I know that it might not work for me but I need to at least try and see. Thank you, Almond888"
1,dianav,107,Hi my boyfriend has the same problem.how are you now?
2,almond888,107,"Hi DianaV, My Psoriasis has calmed down a lot. I still have a few lessions on my legs and elbows. It should have been gone but I have not been very strict with my diet over the holidays. It is significantly better. Even my doctor was amazed with the results that I got. I am less concerned with how it looks and have been able to wear dresses and skirts again. Aside from following the protocol, my doctor prescribed alot of supplements to help with my recovery. I avoided foods which contains dairy, sugar and gluten. I find that I am sensitive to foods containing those ingredients. I have been taking a lot of fish oils, coconut oil, vitamin C, D3, zinc, beta carotene, magnesium and calcium to name a few. I also do a lot of exercises. I also read the book by Dr.John O.A. Pagano “Healing Psoriasis” (ISBN:978-0470-26726-4). Positive thinking has helped me alot in my recovery. The cure is not just through diet, Psoriasis is also a by product of stress. Your boyfriend would also need to address his stress levels. Digestion and our mental state are related to each other. I am very happy with my results and I know what foods trigger my Psoriasis. I have to return to my strict diet because I know that I have not yet completely gotten rid of my candida infection. Positive mental attitude and the belief that I can cure myself through food and healthy living has paid off. I am confident that I can get rid of this. It is not easy, but I was determined to do this and it has paid off. You really have to tell yourself that you can do this because the alternative is not very appealing. I refuse to use biologics and compromise my immune system. I wish you and your boyfriend the best. I am still in my journey of curing myself and feel that I can do this. Good Luck! I hope that I was able to help you."
0,bouncygal,108,"I had this skin condition that started to cause patches of my skin not to tan and it all started on my shoulder 2 years ago, i had all these white spots and a year ago it started to spread down my arm, i was told there is no cure and doctors know very little about it, im on month four of the candida diet Lisa Richards website version and my skin pigment has returned, the spots now are only slightly less tan than my normal skin and you really have to look hard to see a diffrence, before it was very very obvious especially when i went brown from sun tanning. I dont know what exactly fixed it but im so happy 🙂 🙂 🙂 http://www.mydr.com.au/skin-hair/vitiligo People with vitiligo may find that the white patches sometimes stop forming without any treatment. The white patches may revert to normal skin colour; however, this is rare and does not usually happen to all affected areas."
1,Bike girl,108,"I am really pleased your skin is getting better. I have the same also severe excema all over my body but I have really cut out sugary things and last few days felt really ill without the sugar but resisted lol. My skin don’t know if it is coincidence but is no way as itchy and just the less itching I am doing is starting to heal. I think for some odd reason, (I aren’t very knowledgeable on skin) but your skin is a reflection on your health overall. So your skin is getting better and so is your health. my consultant isn’t very good with my condition either just shoves steroid creams at me when I was the one who googled candida. it amazes me just how many people have skin conditions and have candida but don’t put the two together. hope your skin continues improving. X"
2,Bike girl,108,"Just wanted to let anyone know who has severe excema I have been having uvb light therapy at the hospital. I’ve had 24 sessions now up to seven minutes and my skin is 95 percent better, plus I have a golden tan. I have to see tomorrow if I need another ten . No blood on my nightie or bed sheets. It’s a funny feeling not to itch either and have better skin although it is severely damaged and like leather now. I would recommend anyone asking about it, it is time consuming three times a week. I think it does kill malassezia fungus which has overgrown, which was part of my problem. X"

4,Bike girl,108,"I thought that but UVB is safer and is different to the suns UVA and far safer than sunbeds, It’s also very much monitored as well, plus I couldn’t go naked and get the hidden bits in the sun, my nosy neighbour would die of shock."
0,benc,109,"I can pretty much tolerate most things now without any sort of reaction. I eat rice, quinoa, sweet potato, pumpkin, squash & swede (of course) as my carbs almost every day. I eat a variety of different meats including beef & game meat (as well as poultry). I don’t have any kefir grains at the moment so eat yogurt pretty much daily. I’ve tolerated things with wheat in and the only major food reaction i’ve had in months has been to something in Japanese food (maybe a trace of soya). Anyway the reason I came on is to thank Able & Raster (& others who kindly gave me advice), and so others in their early to mid stage can see it does come to an end. Along with carrying on a healthy diet (something I generally had before having candida, parasite, or leaky gut issues) & healthy lifestyle, I would really suggest trying to allow yourself to have a positive outlook. Its easier said than done, but I was defiantly left with a fear of eating things that I hadn’t prepared well beyond when I think my problems were healed. If you can get past that your on the other side. Good luck to everyone, I wish you quick healing."

Hi, so what was the best Anti-fungal that you used that helped you?"
4,MarshallSt,109,I too would like to thank Able900 and Raster for they really have allowed me to make big strives and improvements on my journey to cure candida. The best antifungal in my opinion would be grapefruit seed extract & allicin garlic.
5,Vegan Catlady,109,"This is my issue with candida “ending”…. Does it end because we have to follow this diet for the rest of our lives, and therefore it ends because we never re-introduce foods we enjoyed prior? This would imply to me that the fungus is there to stay forever, never reverting to yeast-form and allowing us a sweet cup of coffee or an apple pie or brownie. If it ends because we can now eat all those things like brownies,(because sugar didnt cause candida, it only fed it, and the fungal form showed up after antibiotics) then that to me would be a genuine ending to candida suffering. So is there a REAL ending, or only an ending to suffering due to following this diet forever?"

0,Harpmary,110,"After years of weight gain, yeast infections, fatigue, headaches, constant upper respiratory infections…blah, blah, blah – everyone here knows the story 🙂 I decided to try the candida diet. Started with the Boroch book then found this site. Having very positive experience so far. Lost about 3 lbs – have been on the diet fairly strictly for about 4-5 days now. I am taking the following supplements: (1) Probiotics – Definitely seems to help (2) CALM – Magnesium/Calcium supplement. (Although I am finding that it seems to does the opposite of ‘calm’ – I get a little wired on it. Maybe the artificial sweetener in it? Anyone else having this issue?) (3) Vitamin D – 2000 IUs – have been taking this for several years now. (4) Was also taking a garlic supplement as I had a cold, but Some things I have noticed: (1) Definite increase in energy. (2) yeast infection has gone away (3) Within 2-3 days, 99% of my cravings have gone away. Anyone else experience this? I don’t crave bread or sugars or anything. (4) I still do crave ‘cream’. I am one of those people that would rather eat a big bowl of whipped cream than a big dark chocolate bar. I always pick vanilla over chocolate. And, I love my tea in the morning (I don’t drink coffee and haven’t for several years as it made me far too agitated – but I drink good tea from the tea purveyor “Upton Teas”) Anyway, I still have my tea in the morning with a dollop of heavy cream (lower carbs than half and half) and haven’t experienced any adverse reactions. Glad to have found this site. Curious what others new to the diet are experience. Thanks."
0,JustinM,111,"After being sick on and off my whole life, I just got told by a doctor that a lot of my problems are probably from candida! I’ve been doing this candida diet for a bit, and it’s going pretty well. Lost some weight that I didn’t need to, but other than that things are legit. Pretty tough to constantly come up with flavorful foods on the candida diet when you’ve never really cooked before! I’m really interested in any great blogs about candida, especially with recipes! I write one on BlogSpot called yeswecandida, but im not really a expert or anything & I’m really just trying to give myself extra motivation to stick to this diet. I know my health should be enough motivation on its own, but it’s way easier to cheat if you don’t think anyone is watching. Especially after work! I just wanna get takeout on my way home, but I know I hafta go home and cook if I wanna follow my diet."
0,suffer-no-more,112,"As far as I can tell my tailspin into candida started in my teens. I was taking Accutane for acne for about 1-2 years at the age of 17. I then moved to a new city and started university where I was infected with an anti-biotic resistant strain of strep throat. I was put on a very strong inter venous anti-biotic to help clear up the infection, which almost closed off my throat entirely. The combination of an exhausted liver from the Accutane and the ‘sterile’ gut from anti-biotics was the perfect breeding ground for candida! For the past 10+ years I have been suffering and always battled through each day thinking that the symptoms I lived with everyday were things that everyone suffered from. I of course went to the doctor the odd time to see if there was anything they could do about my worst symptoms, which were gastrointestinal in nature. I was told that I likely had IBS and there was nothing they could do more me. I eventually had a biopsy and was tested for gluten intolerance; however, the result was negative even though I felt better avoiding wheat. Other symptoms included dermatitis, tiredness, anxiety, depression, weak muscles, no energy, brain fog, mood swings, itchy eyes, dry mouth, bad breath, etc. In October 2013 I had done some online research into anti-fungals after reading about candida online. I tried a variety of things, first starting with a detox with an OTC kit (Cleanse Smart). It was a two part kit for liver detox and colon detox – it certainly helped! I was also on the candida diet at this time. After my 1 month detox I started a very diverse self-made treatment plan of raw garlic, oil of oregano, zinc, grapefruit seed extract, biotin, vitamin D, and probiotics. I experienced the worst symptoms yet, the die-off reaction was brutal. I felt like a had the worst flu of my life and could not function. My body just shook and I couldn’t even stand I felt so terrible. I did feel somewhat better after my massive die-off and was able to start exercising for the first time in years. I stuck to my plan for about another 1 1/2 months but it just seemed that I couldn’t feel a vast improvement. In December I went to an ND and she recommended trying HCl pills. Whether I had it all along, or if it was a result of years of candida overgrowth, I seemed to have low stomach acid. This leads to a recurring cycle of infection because any ingested pathogens can reinfect your intestines if they are not deactivated by the very low pH in your stomach. This seemed to really help my gastrointestinal symptoms of gas, bloating, diarrhea, etc. even though I was off the candida diet. I still have a myriad of other problems including skin issues, insomnia, and mood problems. Today I went back for a follow-up visit to the ND and I am now on Candaclear Four pills (starting tomorrow). I am hoping that getting rid of the candida this time will be the final battle due to the HCl helping to prevent re-infection. I plan to post further developments and I would appreciate any advice."
1,suffer-no-more,112,"So I am a couple weeks into the Candaclear Four pills and I must say that I feel much better. The pills themselves are quite intense and make you smell like garlic. They can be fairly hard on the stomach as well, so definitely eat them with food. I cannot say that any symptom is gone 100%, but here are some that my treatment has helped so far: dry eyes/mouth fatigue irritable bowel gas roseacea I am still struggling with the following, but I must admit that on business trips I find it almost impossible to stay on a candida diet: flaky skin (ears, scalp, etc) insomnia Nothing Earth shattering in this update, but after the next two weeks or so of Candaclear Four, I will be moving on to some L-glutamine, omega-3 oils, and potentially more supplements. I hope to beat this still and suffer-no-more!"

0,Nellyburns4,113,"Hi all I’ve finally put all the pieces of the puzzle together and worked out that I have candida. My symptoms currently are: IBS – Constipation Recurring cystisis Itchy bum Itchy scalp Itchy ears – feeling like I have to clean them several times a day Bad breath Serious sugar and carbohydrate cravings Tiredness Low libido I’ve always craved sugar and sweets my whole life and as a consequence, I’ve always had to exercise and watch my weight. It has in later years, developed into bulimia occasionally. I was on the contraceptive pill for over 15 years and now after having 2 children, I’ve come off it. I frequently develop tonsillitis, sinusitis and Urinary tract infections therefore have taken lots of antibiotics. When I was pregnant with my first child, I developed nipple thrush and couldn’t breastfeed and I also had Group B Strep so in labour, I had to have antibiotics to protect my son being born. Unfortunately, I had to have an emergency c-section with my son and then 4 years later with my daughter, another c-section. Between having my second child, I developed IBS and was diagnosed with it. So now, I’ve finally had enough and changing my eating. – I have not had coffee in over a week (a huge part of my day) – I have not eaten bread in 4 days – this is huge too – I have not eaten any fruit for days, apart from 1 strawberry and 6 blueberries – I LOVE fruit – I have not had any dairy apart from Natural yogurt. I’ve been drinking almond milk. I have included a few things too: – Garlic oil capsules – I was taking about 4 a day but hubby said my breath stunk so I have stopped those – Organic unrefined extra virgin coconut oil – 2 tablespoons a day – Candex probiotic of a night time (I think this is different that Candex in USA. It has Lactobacillus acidophilus 32 billion, Lactobactillus rhamnosus 4 billion and Sacchoromyces cerevisiae bourlardii 4 billion) – I’ve also been taking 5 Pau d’arco capsules daily. I’m going to see my naturopath later this week to clean up my diet a bit. I’ve read so much conflicting information about grains such as oats, whole wheats, quinoa, brown rice, grains chickpeas etc. I’d still love to include some of these but unsure as to if it will just stop progress. My cravings have disappeared which is amazing, I’m a little tired and feel like I’m getting run down but other than that, no die off symptoms. Does anyone else have any other suggestions or advice for me? I’m still trying to get my head around all this candida diet stuff!"
1,Vegan Catlady,113,"Sounds like your on the right track to me. There is conflicting evidence that eliminating fruit works. Some say symptoms lessen, which is awesome, but that if candida cant find food, it goes fungal and wants to travel. I have also heard that fruits like blackberries, strawberries, raspberries (especially!) have whats called ellagic acid. While ellagic acid doesnt hang around long in our bodies and is not absorbed super-well, its presence breaks down the walls in the fungal-form of the yeast and makes it easier to kill…especially since these walls- or chitin- I think its called, is what makes ridding ourselves of this fungus challenging. I do berries almost every day. Pomegranates when I can. I am a bad example of how to behave however…. I still do a cup of coffee in the morning, I use coconut-creamer (because im vegan) and I throw a scoop (about 1-2 tsp) of virgin coconut oil in it. tastes like I dipped a donut in my coffee….mmmmmm….. I will be interested to hear how the candex works. I want to try something like that, but im so overwhelmed with the product-world. My situation is much different than yours, since I include fruit, my energy is through the roof…but the downside is that I only seem to manage symptoms, not seeing them disappear yet."

0,favre360,115,"Now that I’m aware of the symptoms I’d have to say my experience with candida began about 11 years ago at the age of 13. I was always an athletic kid but ate lots of sugar, and hardly ever drank any water. In highschool I got really health conscious and ate a very strict diet high in healthy proteins, fats, and carbs, but still lots of gummy-bears and protein bars that were loaded with sugar. I lifted heavy weights 4 days a week, and always had six-pack abs. One day it hit me (14/15 years old). I was so tired all the time, and I’d get these gut wrenching IBS cramps… The cramps went away once I discovered I had a soy allergy and discontinued eating the protein bars, but I was still having trouble staying awake in class and got 7-8hrs every night. The doctors were baffled. All the stupid little tests they do turned out fine and it was “all in my head”. Once I graduated highschool, I moved to Bangkok to help my cousin with his business. I drank every night and got seriously addicted to cigarettes, opium, cocaine, and barbiturates. So now I’m back in NY and trying to get healthy again. I still drink and smoke but have been cutting back to where I drink maybe 30 beers, and smoke 10 cigs a week… (Baby steps right?!) For the last 8 months I have had: -Exfoliative chelitis (I apply chapstick every 15 minutes to keep it at bay) -Thrush -Anxiety/Panic attacks -Itchy butthole -Bloody and yellow snot -Smelly fingernails -Bad breath that gets worse when I eat simple sugars -Dizziness and mental fog -IBS attacks Last month right before Xmas I got rosea pityriasis and self-diagnosed but wanted a second opinion. I went to the doctor and he got all defensive. “Well you don’t know that for sure, so I’m going to run some tests.” Again I am seemingly healthy on the outside. Great shape, still got my 6-pack abs, no blood pressure issues etc. He calls me back and says it’s all in my head. WTF. So here I am, ready to cleanse and luckily I’m a landscaper so work right now is as simple as plowing driveways when it snows. I’ve been reading up on the paleo diet for quite sometime now and have been waiting to completely cut the alcohol/tobacco, but I get the WORST cravings. Knowing it’s the candida and I won’t actually die (try telling my body that) on only 100-150g complex carbs per day is a real consolation because I’ve tried to do this before but experienced the “candida die-off” I’ve been reading about, and the heart palpitations/cravings led me to believe my body just NEEDED more simple sugars (I’m incredible active despite the fatigue, and active people need carbs). Anyway i’ll try to keep everyone posted on my progress in this thread. I’m not going to cleanse because it’s taken me years to build this much muscle mass (6’3″, 200lbs, 12% body fat), and I’m not about to ruin all the gains I’ve worked so hard for. From what I can gather going paleo(no simple sugars, grains, or dairy), getting lots of probiotics, quitting beer/cigs, and taking some caprylic acid should have me feeling like new in 3-6 months. Western medicine is a cruel, cruel joke. Instead of fixing the root cause of illness they just give you crap to mask the symptoms and tell you it’s all in your head. Thanks to Obama, now we’re all forced to subscribe to this two-bit clown shoe operation… But that’s another thread for another forum 🙂1 user thanked author for this post.  5Roseray5"

Right the hell on,dude. We are trying to decide in my house if its not just better to pay a fine instead 😉 Advice,take with a grain of salt- try upping the fiber and cutting out the meat and dairy for a few days, and see how you feel. Dont eliminate carbs or fruit or veggies, just do some high fiber,hydrate, and give the meat and dairy a rest. The reason I say this is because some people are really bad-off and struggle to eat just lettuce; some,like you, can still eat regular food but feel like crap. You might be lucky enough to rid this candida with just some lifestyle choices, and the kidneys and liver will catch a break if you get disciplined for a few days."
2,raster,115,"I hate to say it but you’ll need to quit smoking someday if you want the panic/anxiety attacks to go away. Do you get these attacks right after you smoke? I am 30 and smoked half of my life and am on week 6 of not smoking. Many of the symptoms you have are way worse by smoking…it literally is killing you from my experience. But its so hard to quit, so I know what you are going through mentally. Your lifestyle has damaged your liver and immune system so you need to rebuild it. I also had a similar lifestyle except maybe half as bad as your levels… I recommend a bunch of stuff but you need to make some basic lifestyle changes in order to get better, then everything will be much much easier. You simply won’t be able to get much better drinking and smoking at high levels. At the least I recommend liver cleansing herbs to help detox. -raster"
3,favre360,115,"Week 1: Day 1: Started by going to my locally owned supplement and vitamin outlet for some goodies. – 2 bottles of NOW Candida Support – 1 bottle of 8 Billion Acidophilus & Bifidus – I took them all (4 of the Candida Support, 2 of the probiotics) as directed. I also take a multi-vitamin every morning. Some of the foods I will NEVER give up in accordance with The Foods to Avoid – My morning protein shake (Muscle Milk (only 2g sugar)) mixed with whole milk. – Pork products (esp bacon) – Peanuts – Carrots – Basmati Rice Everything else, I can honestly live without. Meal 1: 1 serving Bob’s Red Mill gluten-free oatmeal (I know I gotta switch to Oat Bran), 4 slices uncured bacon, 4 eggs fried in the grease, morning protein shake. Meal 2: Stir fry. Olive oil, 8oz chicken thighs (weighed after fully cooked), broccoli,celery, red bell pepper, habaneros, jalapenos, peanuts, and jicama. Fried in olive oil. Meal 3: Half of a medium sized jicama eaten raw, 4oz grilled chicken breast with baby carrots, all smothered with Franks Red-Hot (0g sugar in the hot sauce). Meal 4: 1/4 cup almonds, kale, and 2 servings unflavored greek yoghurt. Meal 5: Stir-fry left over from brunch but instead of 8oz chicken thigh I used 4oz grilled chicken breast, and put it over 1/2 cup (uncooked) of basmati rice. Meal 6: At this point I’m absolutely starving and my stomach is growling like mad so I grilled up a NY strip, ate 6oz (weighed after i cooked it), and drank at least 3 servings of whole milk. Now I’m writing this and getting ready to sleep. I haven’t had any alcohol tonight so I didn’t smoke any cigarettes… Tobacco withdrawal is a joke when you’ve had to rip yourself off opiates, so quitting smoking/drinking wont even be a big deal. The hardest part about all this is cooking so much food all the time and never being able to catch up with the dishes 🙁"

7,Floggi,115,"  What you call ‘Obamacare’ is really nothing new in my country. We’ve had various systems for many decades now, and they are similar to your ‘Obamacare’. It simply means that everyone is obliged to have a basic medical insurance. Additional insurance is optional. I hear terrible stories from the USA about people not being able to pay their medical bills, and either becoming indebted beyond repair, or avoiding treatment because it’s just too expensive. That’s one thing that doesn’t happen here. We chose the obligatory insurance road. Another road would be to provide basic medical treatment for free, and pay the doctors and the hospitals through taxes. The insurance road proved to be cheaper for society than the tax road. Therefore, we have ‘Obamacare’ for as long as I can remember, and we are actually quite happy with it.  "

If I don’t need nor want tap water, I can stop paying my bill. The same goes for rent, electricity, and food. America was founded on the principles of life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. As someone who lives in The Netherlands it’s really in your best interest to support the American way of life anyway, seeing as we’ve got around 54,000 troops currently stationed in Germany. What do you think would happen if we pulled those troops out?? Not to mention, Amsterdam is 10 feet below sea level. I’d love to meet the genius who said “Hey let’s build our capital city right in the middle of a dried up pond”. But seriously, no more going off topic for me. This thread is about my battle with candida, not my ancestors who fought for an America where people told the government what to do and not the other way around."
9,Floggi,115,"  If you think it’s off-topic, then please do not rant. Health insurance follows from the concept of paternalistic capitalism. This is solidly founded in modern-day psychology. The question to be answered is: how to lower the total cost for society? It turns out that a basic health insurance lowers the total cost, which is for the benefit of all. This is not about the government forcing people to do something they don’t want; instead, it’s something the people called for, and the government followed. Please don’t get me started about those thousands of soldiers who are still present in a different country. If you insist though, I can inform you about what happened when foreign soldiers left the German town of Giessen… About living below sea level… that’s no problem at all. We are experts in living with water. It’s a pity that some countries are too high-nosed to accept that as a fact. This too is detrimental to the citizens of those countries. For example, look at the flooding of New Orleans after hurricane Katrina hit it. Our water engineers warned about the terrible state of New Orleans water management years before, but no-one cared. When disaster struck and the predicted flooding occurred, we happened to have a ship nearby with some of our best engineers and, conveniently, with extremely powerful water pumps. The ship changed course and headed for New Orleans to provide help. For a reason that was never explained, it was denied entrance to any nearby harbour. Even offers to offload the equipment to a different ship were rejected. The same happened to an offer to let our engineers calculate the best way to prevent more damage, to remove the water, and to prevent such flooding in the future. Instead, your government (or must I say: your people, who seemingly tell the government what to do) did it their own way, which (predictably) failed. This caused large delays, and much of the water-management work had to be re-done. Now let’s go back to fighting candida. That too is something from which much more Americans than Dutch (or Germans) suffer.  "

If America actually used tax dollars efficiently… HAHA. Sorry I gotta stop. That last one’s a little too utopian for my liking. Week 1 Day 3: Getting back on track diet wise has been awesome, and a lot of my symptoms are already regressing. I’ve been incredibly tired probably sleeping 10 hours per night, and taking a 3 hour nap in the afternoon. I figure my body knows best, and I’ll just give it the rest it needs. I was at the store yesterday, and trying to justify finding a light beer to drink because the pro-bowl was on. I purposely avoided the beer section entirely which really wasn’t easy, but I know how it goes. I drink, and then I smoke, and then I’m down the street ordering a burger, or fried chicken with baked beans and corn bread… Commencing salivation!! The main symptom getting noticeably better is my upper lip, which has been cracking and peeling for the last 8 months. It’s finally getting smooth and moist again. I’m only applying chapstick once an hour now as compared to every 15 minutes, and it’s 18F outside!! I never expected my lips to get better this time of year. No brain fog or dizziness after meals which has been nice. Anxiety/panic attacks/heart palpitations have been absent the past 24 hours, as has any yellow coating on my tongue. Also the past 24 hours I have not experienced itchy butthole, IBS, or bad breath. The only symptom still present is bloody yellow snot when I wake up which is to be expected seeing how my last cigarette was only 3 days ago and my lungs/sinuses are clearning themselves out. I’m glad my symptoms are clearing up so quickly, but I’m also a little disappointed because it means I’m going to have to make permanent lifestyle changes before they become habitual. Let me explain: It takes about 21 days to solidify an action into a habit. This is not the first time I’ve done a weeks worth of healthy eating and not smoking/drinking, only to convince myself “It doesn’t matter if you drink/smoke/eat carbs and fried foods all the time because your symptoms go away so quickly!!!”. This time though, I’d like to make the rest of my life, the best of my life. Hence why I registered at this forum and started this thread. I’m hoping that if I really take the time to document my progress and leave it right at the top of my head day-in and day-out, I can make this stick!! Happy Monday everyone."

12,Floggi,115,"  I know of no smoker who cannot survive without a cigarette for and hour and a half. In cases like the one you describe, my solution is always: no smoking in the car, not even with all windows wide open. Smoke a cigarette before we leave. Then we drive for an hour and a half at most. Then there’ll be a cigarette break. Continue this recipe until we reach our destination. This solution has always functioned.  "
13,favre360,115,"Thought I was outta the woods for a second there, and that perhaps my candida symptoms were smoking related. Nope! Still no cigs/beer/glutens since friday, but then last night I did some heavy deadlifts/squats, and was starving when I got home. I had a plate of pasta with chicken… Slept terribly, lips started cracking this morning, got a little pimple under my tongue, and the yellow stuff is back. Looks like I need to stay away from gluten for good 🙁"

In my experience it’s best to attack this in stages, otherwise you’ll forget your 100 medications to take per day. I’ve come a long ways since October 2013 so I’ll share what worked for me: Step 1: herbal cleanse that targets the liver and colon – this will help your system eliminate toxins when you eventually kill off the yeast Step 2: increase pH in your stomach with meals – I did this with HCl but you can also try unpasteurized/unfiltered apple cider vinegar (this will help reduce re-infection from yeasty foods like bread & cheese) Step 3: fight, fight, fight with anti-fungals – RAW garlic, cinnamon, coconut oil, oil of oregano, olive leaf extract, etc. Experiment with what works best for you but some of these can be expensive. Can’t really go wrong with raw garlic assuming you can handle it. Step 4: repair your intestines – L-glutamine, N-acetyl glucosamine, and probiotics Steps 1-3 should be for at least 1 month each. Step 4 should last for 4 months, it takes 120 days for your intestines to completely turnover its cells. Take my advice at your own risk. I have a BSc in Nutrition, but they don’t even mention candida overgrowth in the program I graduated from. Good luck"
3,raster,116,"Check out the responses to your other posts, I gave you some good advice there… The anxiety can be improved by taking supplements that heal the brain. The brain is largely made up of fat, so fatty acids can help reduce anxiety. A great cheap one is flax oil with lignens. The lethargy is likely related to thyroid and adrenal health and both these organs take a long time to heal with a specific plan. You should generally feel better if you follow the diet. The brain fog is also related to the anxiety and you simply need to detox long term for this to improve. If you reduce the candida numbers then this will go away or improve also. The belching and gas is likely related to deficiencies in stomach acid: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6027_Hydro-chloric-Acid-and-Health–written-by-Dr–McCoombs.aspx The body aches are likely related to pH levels, inflammation, and minerals. These are all inter-related. What you need: -something to kill the yeast slowly such as SF722 -liver detox supplements such as super milk thistle X, dandelion, nettle leaf, juniper root -anti-inflammatory supplements such as fermented cod liver oil, flax, fatty acids, etc. (these should help brain health too). -digestive aids such as glutamine, digestive enzymes, etc (you got these) (can give a bigger list) -to follow the strict forum candida diet with organic foods -certain vitamins such as vitamins abcde, biotin, minerals, etc (varies person to person) As you can see, it gets quite expensive fast. -raster"
0,imogenhastings,117,"Hi everyone. I am a 28 year-old female. I started the anti-candida diet a year ago after living for eleven years with a resistant vaginal yeast infection (candida albicans), which does not respond to azole treatment. It was uncomfortable every day, my doctors didn’t have a clue what to do, and I had had enough. So when I found the anti-candida community it was illuminating and I immediately changed my diet and lifestyle accordingly. Many symptoms I initially had no idea were related to my yeast infection have disappeared over the year. These include: fungal skin infections fungal toenail infections anxiety dandruff debilitating PMT rashes on my elbows itchy nipples recurrent bronchitis recurrent pelvic infections night sweats …and more. But the vaginal yeast infection, the whole reason I began this journey in the first place, has not disappeared. It’s a constant infection – it doesn’t come and go. It does, however, flare up and get much worse occasionally, when most of the time it’s still there but just ‘at bay’. I stick to the diet pretty well, with the odd stumble, but overall I feel quite proud of myself for how much I’ve achieved. I simply can’t understand why everything else has gone away except for this one thing. My big fear is that the length of time I’ve had the infection has some how damaged my vagina and made it impossible for it to recover. Wondered whether anyone had any advice, words of support, or experiences to share that I might draw from? Thank you. Imogen"
1,Able900,117,"Hello. I’m not doubting that you have or had a Candida albicans overgrowth considering your other symptoms, but have you been tested lately to make certain that you do not also have bacterial vaginosis? Quote: Many women often mistakenly think they have a “yeast infection” and treat themselves when, in fact, they have a similar vaginal infection that will not respond to self-treatment with over-the-counter yeast medications. A study by the American Social Health Association found that 70% of women self-treated vaginal infections before calling a health care provider. Most often, they incorrectly thought they had a yeast infection when, in fact, it was bacterial vaginosis. If you’re certain that your problem is still the Candida, I would need to know about the supplements the amounts you were taking during your treatment before offering any suggestions; also what you are taking at this time. Able"
2,bre b,117,"Able is right… you could have BV. Although, if you have had a consistent yeast infection problem and been diagnosed with such, the doctors may not be able to do much in the way of conventional medications. BV is a bacterial infection, and it is treated with Metronidazole (which is an azole drug… and you do not respond to treatment, correct?) or with Clindamycin, an anti-biotic that will provoke the Candida and throw off your intestinal flora balance, causing possible recurrent systemic symptoms that you have listed above. It maybe a combination of the two, and therefore kind of a lose/lose situation. I have the same issue. I had my first yeast infection at 5 years old, and was diagnosed with Systemic Candida at age 18. I am 30 now, and still struggle with it. There is no way truly of “beating” it, so I keep it at bay. I would be interested to see if anyone knew of any natural supplements. I am currently taking Candida cleanse mixed herbal supplements, with probiotics and a liquid hydrogen peroxide supplement that provides pure oxygen after it is diluted in water. I have heard Candida is anaerobic, meaning it cannot survive with oxygen, and thus the pure O2 molecules can purge the system. At any rate, when I take it, I feel a cleansing and a good bit of “die-off” occurs fairly quickly. It may just be the energy boost my poor system needs after fighting this for 12 years. I understand your pain Imogen, it is a constant battle and it feels like it will never stop sometimes. I am just happy to have found a regiment that’s working for the time being… My body will quickly stop responding to treatments, and then I go without for a year and start back over. Hormones have a lot to do with the recurrent vaginal yeast infections as well… are you on birth control? I had to stop taking hormonal therapy as a means of contraception because of it affecting my severity of vaginal yeast overgrowth. Just a few thoughts Bre"

Acidophilus vaginal pessaries, which you can buy online or at some health food stores, are very effective but very expensive as I have to keep using them to keep the problem at bay. I’ve not found a way of ending this condition, but as long as I keep treating it, I don’t have thrush, cystitis or vaginosis, all of which have plagued me in the past. When I stop treating it, it comes back. I find the problem is related to hormonal changes in my menstrual cycle and if I start treating the problem at the right time ( a day or two before my period) I can treat it daily for a few days and it will usually go away completely for a month, unless I have a candida flare up for another reason eg eat the wrong food or get ill."

0,ijustcanttakeit75,118,"Sorry in advance for the long post! I’m so frustrated. I accidentally ate sugar tonight, and sugar makes me crazy. In fact, a few days ago I ate something that was made purely from dried dates and walnuts, but it didn’t occur to me that the dried dates would have a high sugar content. Within 24 hours the depression/anxiety started to escalate and eventually I exploded in my car to the point where I was sobbing and hyperventilating because of how upset I was. If anyone had been with me they would have thought that I just got a call saying my best friend died. They would have called a psychiatrist. Sometimes I think I must be psychotic. I recently found out I have candida overgrowth, along with a multitude of food allergies, such as wheat, casein, yeast and everything else under the sun (sometimes I wish I could just move to another planet where I wouldn’t be allergic to the produce). And for the last 22 years of my life I never had any idea what was wrong with me, but now it makes so much sense. Finally the mood swings seem to have some consistency, in the sense that I can predict when they’re coming because now I know the source of it all. I have so much brain fog. I used to throw fits every day as a kid and space out during class. Even now at my job my coworkers are telling me that ever since I stopped eating sugar I haven’t been going into as many “trances” as I used to, even though I had no idea I went into trances at work. I do have a specific memory of a time in grade school when I came to consciousness in the middle of class and everyone around me was out of their seats grabbing textbooks and the teacher was towering over me yelling, asking why I wasn’t paying attention, but I was so confused. Because I hadn’t been sleeping. I’d been staring at a wall. But for the life of me I couldn’t remember what I was thinking about. So… Fast forward fifteen years and I’m still so confused all the time. Two boyfriends dumped me for the same reason, my “emotional instability.” I recently lost a relationship with someone I really liked a lot, because I had a freakout over absolutely nothing that wouldn’t end. It all started because I was acting like a child in the grocery store (ADHD), and after we left I sensed that it irritated him a bit, so I started crying about it and couldn’t stop. He was really taken aback and wanted to know why I was crying, but I couldn’t articulate why, because I had no idea. Two weeks later I got upset about something completely irrational, and for two days I wouldn’t stop harping on the same issue and fighting about it, even though I had no reason to be so upset. We hadn’t known each other long enough for that sort of behavior to be acceptable, but for some reason I did it anyway. My anxiety was just so bad. When I have brain fog, I don’t always understand what people are trying to say to me, so I’ll ask them to explain again and again because I can’t understand why I don’t understand, and I can’t accept the fact that I don’t understand. This leads to fights, drama and miscommunications. Sometimes I get so antsy and restless that I want to tear my hair out. I’ll start punching things because I’m so frustrated. I get in these moods where I FEEL like my life isn’t going anywhere and like nothing is ever enough, even though I know that’s not true. As if my need for more, more, more — whatever “more” is — is never satiated. So long as I don’t eat sugar or anything I’m allergic to, I seem to behave like a normal human being with a logical head on my shoulders, but get the wrong foods in me and I completely lose my sanity and have social phobias. All my self-confidence disappears and I become extremely nervous. I’m just so frustrated because it’s been so hard. Trying to figure out what I can and can’t eat. The sugar cravings are so bad, and every time I see sugar it’s this awful tease because I want it so bad, but I know if I eat it I will lose control of myself and my senses. Sorry to rant, but I just needed somewhere to vent my feelings, because it seems like no one comprehends it. I read about people going through this sort of thing and talking about how they’re so lucky they have a supportive lover or friend, but I always just get the same result. I always scare people away. People love me, except when I have sugar in me, or any of my allergies. Then everyone close to me runs for the hills. I had no idea food could have this kind of effect, and it sounds so extreme, but it’s becoming more real to me all the time, every time I eat the wrong food. Is this familiar to anyone at all? Is it really possible that sugar could be so harmful to me? Or should I be seeing a psychiatrist?"

2,TheChosenOne,118,"Sounds like all your problems are related to candida. I think you will find a lot of people who understand you here. Although I think my infestation is not that extreme as others, I have some of your symptoms too. For me it’s more like anxiety and anger – but maybe that’s a difference between men and women. Remember that candida produces a lot of different kind of toxins, whereof a certain amount can change your behavior (like ethanol). Eating a lot of sugar/caffeine can make me crazy too. It’s okay to see a psychiatrist, as long as you don’t have to take any medication. But I’m very pretty sure that all your psychological problems are related to a candida overgrowth. Same goes for food allergies (search for ‘leaky gut’). I’m on week 10 of the strict diet and a lot of my anxiety is gone. Also, sugar cravings disappear a few weeks after eating no sugar at all.

0,Lex,119,"Hi guys, I developed candida in 2008 after receiving a lot of intravenous antibiotics for a leg infection (I also drank heavily at the time and had pre-existing immune system disorders for which I was already on medical disability- needless to say, I developed candidiasis). Took me about 4 or 4 and a half years before I put two and two together (amazed no doctors figured it out, but I have come to understand that many allopathic doctors either don’t know about candida overgrowth or don’t believe it is an actual problem). I have a LOT of the general candida symptoms all stemming from that time period… but what has bothered me from the beginning is this feeling I get of feeling drunk/”high” and sort of stoned/unreal. It starts (now that I pay attention to diet) about 2-3 hours after I eat, and until recently I have been eating my usual not-too-great diet. So I was wondering if this drunken, fuzzy high feeling “die off”? 2 to 3 hours after eating the candida is being starved of it’s usual (in my case, unfortunately) overly starchy diet and is dying and releasing toxins into my blood which make me feel “high”/drunk? This scared me the most (except maybe for the increased panic sensations) because I had no idea candida could cause this spacey/drunk sensation and began to think I was going crazy or had some form of brain damage. What causes such a difference in the symptomology amongst sufferers and have any of you guys suffering from the unreal/drunk/high feeling found relief with any herbs or any other therapies? Every time I tried the diet in the past this drunk feeling got so bad that I felt like I wasn’t sure I was actually awake (as opposed to dreaming) and that more than almost anything caused me to get scared and relapse, so if anybody else is dealing with this particular symptom and can offer me any advice or hope, I could sure use it. Also, the few times I have tried the diet in the past the die off got so bad that I was so exhausted, I was pretty much unable to do the day to day things I needed to do. So tips for how to handle both of these would be great. Thanks."
1,TheChosenOne,119,"I think most people that have candida are suffering from the things you mention. I used to feel ‘unreal’ right before a meal, and still have it sometimes right before breakfast. It brings anxiety, panic attacks and this drunken feeling with it. There are two times when candida releases toxins. When you feed them and when they die. So every time at 2 to 3 hours after a meal can be the candida that are being fed."
2,Lex,119,"I always have the drunken/high feeling to some extent, since about 2-3 weeks after the IV antibiotics in 2008, however, it gets markedly worse 2-3 hours (or more) after I eat to such an amazing degree that it rivals marijuana and alcohol combined (all of which I have stopped, but the sensation is similar to being inebriated by both of them at the same time). Eating starchy foods seems to reduce it a small amount. For instance, I have been fasting all day because I am low on cash and want to kill off candida, but I have cookies (I put them downstairs in the storage locker) and I know if I were to eat some of them, I wouldn’t feel as drunk and high in about 30 minutes. But if I keep doing that I will never get well and always feel foggy, tired, achy, itchy… to a lesser extent. And that is not good. My hunch is that the spaciness increasing 2-3 hours after my last meals is not that they are being fed (because digestion doesn’t take that long) but it is when my blood sugars are starting to dip because I haven’t eaten in awhile and they are starting to die. That is just my gut feeling on the subject. It is “nice” to know others experience the same things and that people have managed to obtain some measure of relief from these symptoms. Lex"
3,Fylgia,119,"Until about two weeks into the protocol, I often felt drunk, but with chills instead of the warm fuzzy feeling. There were days I just be walking then all the sudden my vision would go fuzzy, my legs turned into noodles, and I’d fall flat on my face, not getting up, because I felt wasted. It’s happened in the car too, and I’d have to pull off the road for fear of an accident. I hope find more ways to supplement your food and get better. I know it’s hard being lacking in cash, but eating and eating what won’t feed the candida will make a world of difference for your symptoms. Fasting is pretty risky considering all that your body has already been through. Best wishes to you."
4,Lex,119,"Thank you, Fyalgia. I had a small amount of fish, because it won’t feed the yeast (I gave most of it to my cat, I try to only eat vegetable based foods) and a handful of nuts (cashews, pecans and almonds). I have read all sorts of things about fasting- some people say it is the best way to quickly starve off yeast, others say greatly reduce food intake but don’t completely fast because if you do the die off is too intense, others say eat anti-candida diet. This is a learning experience for all of us I guess."
5,Fylgia,119,"Indeed, it is. Try to stay away from cashews and pecans (I haven’t a clue why; they’re just not considered a safe food) and switch them out with raw pumpkin seeds, raw sunflower seeds, and/or walnuts. Here’s a safe food list that raster’s posted, and most of these things are affordable depending on where you live.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm49578_Raster-s-safe-food-list.aspx Personally, I added canned black olives as a cheap snack to my diet. They’re safe too, as long as they are in a water-salt brine and not vinegar, if you like that sort of thing. P.S.: if you can afford some, I’ve bought liver detox tea (because I was heavy on the drinks myself) and milk thistle tea in bulk online. Both have really helped ease my candida/die-off symptoms. And sugarless, unsweetened aloe vera juice helps your body better absorb vitamins and minerals while fighting the fungus. I hope this helps."
6,Lex,119,I love canned black olives! Was thinking that I want a snack… will go and buy a can of black olives! Thanks Fylgia!
7,bre b,119,"I have had Systemic Candiasis for over a decade. I started having problems with multiple Fungal infections after getting messed up on meth as a teenager. I have dealt with this for years. It only goes away or gets better if you honestly cut out all the things that feed it from your diet. I am yeast free (no breads as much as possible), gluten-free, and also lactose-free. I found out I’m allergic to gluten and lactose. Two things I ate ALL the time. I am also low-sugar, low-carb. Stay away from over processed foods and fast food as much as possible. It’s the most difficult thing to do, changing up your diet, but after 4-6 weeks your taste buds will change, and even if your body is craving sugar, starches, etc. you will begin to really enjoy the raw veggies, rice pasta, yogurt, etc. that your body can have… I also take a Candida cleanse herbal supplement for months at a time when my overgrowth comes back. It’s a struggle to have it from your hairline to your toes and everywhere inbetween. The Candida in my system is now a full fungal form. It’s much more difficult to get rid of. When I have a “die-off” wave, my entire body itches from head to toe. I guess sticking with it is the most difficult, I also have to avoid “moldy” foods like cheeses… I try to be as vigilent as possible but it’s not always easy. Peanuts and a lot of other nuts have a tendency to grow mold, and that only provokes the yeast in your gut. Make sure you are taking a strong probiotic, change up your diet, don’t starve yourself to starve the Fungus. That type of stress only weakens your system further. It is over working itself trying to help clear out the toxins that are a by product from the infection itself. I promise, if you eat right and be strict, your tastes will change and you will love the foods that are Anti-Candida! I’m no saint. I struggle with it, and have for a decade, but I’m finally seeing results. Diet, probiotics, and herbal antifungal supplement have done wonders. Best of luck to you in the future! Bre"
8,Lex,119,"Thank you so much bre b! I have only been on the diet for a little over a day now (I have tried before and slipped up so badly but decided to try again). I have felt EXTREMELY drunk and high as the hours went on and last night was getting chest pain, racing thoughts, and my BLOOD feels itchy. My arms, legs, belly, head, toes… all are itchy, but it feels deeper than the itch associated with dry skin. Also have this subtle but persistent taste in my mouth, like rotten flesh or something(I had an abcessed tooth as a teenager that was pulled and drained and the gum around it went black and that is similar to the taste I have in my mouth) The nuts I have been eating are cashews, almonds and pecans, but no peanuts, but after these nuts are gone I won’t get anymore (just in case). Weird aches and pains all over and a sense of imminent doom (but I have had panic attacks my whole life so who knows). Pretty sure I am already getting die off. I have been taking vitamin C (5,000-10,000 mg for a few days) and I took 4,000 IU of vitamin D3 last night too. is tofu allowed on the diet? I found a hot and sour soup paste which doesn’t have an grams of carbs or sugar (and doesn’t have sugar listed in the ingredients) per table spoon and thought I could make a soup from it and throw in some firm tofu cubes, green onions and some seaweed. What do you guys think? Would that meal be good for someone trying to stick to the diet? I can’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be okay, but am a bit jumpy about screwing up. Thank you again, everyone, for your posts!"
9,Lex,119,"I double checked and the hot and sour soup paste I have actually does have sugar- it’s the second to last ingredient (the very last is paprika). However, when I look to see how many grams of sugar it has on the side it says 0 grams sugar and 0 grams carbs (per 15 grams, which I am guessing is about 1 tablespoon). So, if the amount of sugar in it is so low that it doesn’t equal 1 gram, can I still have it? Not sure and don’t want to risk it… just thought I’d ask…."

ChosenOne brings up a good point. I get these attacks either right before or a couple hours after meals. The brain-mind gut plays a lot into this role, too. I never thought about it being the candida releasing the toxins. Try looking into supplements that can relieve your anxiety at each meal, and that seems to help balance me more when I am haywire, plus it makes me have better food choices. I think relora is a good supplement, plus it stops the sugar cravings!"
12,laineyk,119,"I have told so many drs that my brain feels wishy washy and I cant concentrate & I feel doped up, they all have looked at me like I am crazy I now believe it has to do with Systemic Candida overgrowth"
13,stifoo,119,I can confirm the strange drunk spells and feeling of separation from reality…Candida is a big meanie!
0,runmillerun,120,"I am so thankful to have discovered this forum. It is a place of validation for what I have been going through for 19 years. To be able to correspond with other individuals suffering from candida means so much to me. I hope it will be a great experience as I just signed on to the forum today. We all need support and help. Candida is crazy difficulIt to overcome. I think some learn to live with in, in balance. I am balance bound now. I will get there. It started for me at any early age with asthma and allergies. My mom being a heavy smoker (cigs are laidened with fungus) and moderate drinker (alcohol feeds yeast) I am rather sure she passed it on to me. (My five brother all struggle with it too). I had 6 mercury fillings before the age of 13 as well I now know that did not help my candida matters at all! (research the correlation) When I got to college it became horrible with the acne, depression, brain fog, anxiety, nail fungus and chronic yeast infections. I took all the convential crap, diflucan and lamsil. I was put on an antidepressant. I still didn’t know what candida was then. I wish that I had been told. This was 1999-2000. So fast foward to now and the several symptoms that have followed me through the years. Only to have become major to my everyday lack of functioning. Joint pain, Tinea versicolor, anxiety, “adhd” like symptoms–concentration issues, moodiness, irratibility, feeling numb or apathetic, depression, muscle soreness, constipation, impaired mental functioning– memory issues, sinus congestion, retcal itching, skin itchiness, dandruff, fatigue,headaches, lack of sex drive, occsaional yeast infections, vag. discharge, sugar cravings and the list goes on. I learned within the last 5 years that candida was what it was called. I would research it and feel overwhelmed. I would try the candida diet and some supplements and quit within a week because the die off was so brutal and I couldn’t follow through with the diet. I tried raw, vegan, and so on. I couldn’t stay consistent. I noticed that each time I went back to take a crack at getting the candida under control I learned something new. Research was so crucial. I am super independent so I have always just wanted to do it on my own. This time around I realize I need help, support and to let others know what I am doing as it is the most important, most challenging thing I have ever done. But this time around is different because I am going to be persistant and consistent in the candida battle. I didn’t realize or admit to myself or outloud how bad my digestive health had been. I finally broke down (in the doctors office) and that minute gave myself permission to make my health a priority. I had admitted that I was not as “healthy” as I thought. I am incredibly stupid and stubborn at times. When I was younger, I sort of thought I was invincible. Now I am almost 35. I watched my oldest brother die of kidney cancer (at 45 years old) this time of year, 3 years ago. It changed me. It made me realize that we have some say in how much time we have. He was full of fungus too. Now to the present day. For 2.5 weeks I have been off all forms of sugar and mostly following (Body Ecology-by Donna Gates). There are so many diets. I even tried Gabriel Cousins–Rainbow raw food book. His diet (phases) is hands down the most effective as he has pure research behind it, but his diet it the most difficult. Donna’s approach is the most doable for me with the apple cider vinegar twice daily, probiotics, proper food combining, only 4 grains (quinoa, buckwheat, amar.millet) 80% veggies/ 20% meat, no cheese, eat until I am 80% full, cultured veggies, sea vegetables, organic vegetables, no fruit or sweets, my selection of supplements (pau d arco- tea/pill form,digestive enzymes, calpryic acid, tea tree oil, oregano oil, garlic, clove, turmeric, msm, flax seed oil, hemp seeds, grapeseed powder/grapefruit extract, milk thistle tea, nettle/dandelion teas,benonite clay, coconut oil, cayenne pepper. And lastly the bi/tri-weekly enemas(water only). I know there is much I am leaving out, but I wanted to put my story out there to help someone. I feel better in a major way. The fog has lifted. I feel happy, emotional, present, and less pain. The tinea versicolor is fading. I feel and can see significant progress. I lost 10 pounds. The bloating and gas is gone. Cravings for sugar have subsided mostly, I eat way less. I feel calmer and more confident. The anxiety has simmered significantly. This is the longest and best I have gone without sugar my whole life. I am happy and I want others to know. The first week was so hard but it is getting easier and through the holidays even. Thanks for reading. Good luck to all of you and feel free to ask questions. I am well read but still learing. I will eventually do to a natropath once I have done a year commitment to this. It took years to get to this point and it will take years to undo. I have accepted this. I am accountable now."
1,Vegan Catlady,120,"I look forward to hearing how you progress. Your progression is going to give me hope 🙂 I dont want to live without sugar, and I was never a sugar addict anyway…but the thought of going without it pisses me off, and I wont accept the idea that we have to live without it."

Even if I get better from Candida (although frankly it seems this is something you have to deal with as a lifetime thing) my body doesn’t want sugar, so i’m not going to give it some! I think once you accept this, everything becomes a little easier. I’m really trying to let go of my anger about Candida- After all, it’s just sugar, there are a helluva lot more important things in the world."
3,Vegan Catlady,120,"Well, that seems to be the consensus outlook here, live without sugar and deal with it. I get that eliminating sugar forever has made people feel better. I dont resonate with that being the answer, as sugar (not white processed but sugar in general) is a very important part of functioning. More important than protein, more important than fat. It seems illogical that we would have SO many receptors on our tongue for sugar, but that we shouldnt consume it. I read last night that there is evidence that supports low carb diets being beneficial for feeling better, but that it actually changes and makes the overgrowth harder to get rid of because of the adaptation. IE, get rid of what is making the yeast overgrow, not just get rid of the yeast."
4,runmillerun,120,"It it not a forever thing. My body needs to heal and it is. I am making myself a priority. Candida is a medical condition that is under estimated. So in a few days it will be a month since I have made a HUGE transformation (I was a sugar addict because that is what the over growth of yeast does– it makes you crave more and more) It is a physical and mental issue for me. Probably emotional too. Which I was very apathetic before. Now I am feeling and sugar/food is not something I look forward to. “Treats” were never that at all. It was what was feeding my issues.

I am still struggling with tinea versicolor and mild yeast/white discharge here and there. This will take time I know. The whole process will. The key is when you are starting to feel good not to run back to the same diet. In time I will reintroduce foods.

I have stuck with several antifungals (caprilic acid, coconut oil, candex, garlic, turmeric, oregano oil, olive leaf, pau d arco tea and powder, herbal teas for live support) I take digestive enzymes before every meal and probiotics in the morning. I have maintained proper food combining and have cheated very little– maybe a bite of dark choc. here and there. I am eating more veggies and not over eating hardly at all. Smaller, frequent meals.

0,aileenrstrong,121,"Years ago (8 years ago maybe) I started to develop a sore around my mouth, like a cold sore that took up most of my face, it would flair up and then almost dissappear and then flair up again, it was VERY painful and embarrassing , I also had extreme fatigue, crazy heart burn and difficulting falling or staying asleep. I struggled with this for a little more than a year before i finally found something that worked (and got rid of the mouth thing *clownlips) – but in the midst of that search I discovered I probably had candida, I ordered some fivelac (they had it in pill form then, though i can’t find it now) and it seemed to work, as long as i was taking it (i also did the powder stuff too) but kept coming back- recently I moved away from my whole family and all my friends to be closer to my fiance, got a new job, new church, new everything. It was probably the stress of this that caused it to flair up again. I got a little rash on my cheek in july, a week later it had swollen and was very painful. I went against my best judgment and got on a plane to fly back home to oregon for my wedding and instead of going home I went strait to the hospital, turns out I had Celulitus (a type of staph infection) which was able to enter and attack my body due to my very weak immune system (from years of fighting candida) due to my very painful and swollen face i spent 4 days on an antibiotic iv drip and then the next 7 days on an oral antibiotic (and thank God my face looked normal again by my wedding)- but due to those antibiotics the candida got worst I now experience all the old symptoms plus a few new ones- scabs on my head, soar/itchy knees and elbows, hot flashes, cold sweats, and insane sugar craving (and complete loss of sex drive which sucks since i’m a newlywed of just 4 months) I did get the fivelac again (i don’t believe it to be a cure for me but it dose help) and i was suckered by the candida cure website and saved up to buy the ridiculously expensive cost- it did help but it’s not gone. I have found this site, spent a few hours reading your posts- I am planning to (after Christmas when i have money again) and Olive leaf supplement and SF722. I can’t do the candida diet – I’m a newly wed, a broke one at that and i can’t ask my husband to go on a crazy diet for no reason and i don’t have the time or money to buy and prepare different food than the stuff i make for him. I wanted to ask you guys what suppliments and foods you guys have used and found success with????"

The candida diet is a huge part of getting rid of Candida. It’s not fun, but it’s necessary. There will be others on the forum here who are more experienced that can help you, but diet- yeah you’re going to have to make some changes, Candida food isn’t terrible so i’m sure you can make things you’ll both like. But if you HAVE to cook for him, then you’ll HAVE to cook Candida friendly foods. If you aren’t starting the diet until after christmas, during christmas try to have as little sugar and yeast as possible- you don’t want to feed the beast too much 🙂 All the best! Like I said- others here will help you more than I can!"
2,impossible,121,"Diet can be alot easier than you think. You dont need crazy or exotic foods. Just eat whole foods, stay away from anything that has sugar in it. Read the package, if it has more than a couple grams of sugar per the serving that your going to eat, stay away from it. Look up foods for starch content and keep that lower. Fried carbs like chips and some crackers are off limits. Go easy on carrots and beets. Eat things like oatmeal and eggs for breakfast, veges, wild or brown rice and meats for lunch/dinner. Snack on nuts and seeds. Dont go crazy limiting the carbs. Stay away from fruit for a while. If you add fruit back in, keep it to small amounts of fresh berries on an empty stomach. People are having the most success with Saccharomyces Boulardii. Its a yeast-eating yeast that also gets rid of alot of other nasty bacteria and promotes a good immune response in the gut. Some people do not tolerate yeast though, as the immune system can become sensitive to it, all bad symptoms are not caused by die off. You can use that with sf722, but no other antifungal. Go easy starting your antifungal protocol, die off can be bad for some. See how a few months of that help you."
3,Vegan Catlady,121,"I am new here too but I just had to say how sorry I am for your situation… my son is 12 and has been on antibiotics so many times recently. He has terrible chest pains, heart racing/pounding, dizziness, and since last July- impetigo. I suffer from candida, but now im pretty sure he is suffering too. I am told what you both suffer from is common (the bacterial infection)…but then so is candida overgrowth. Im doing some research on deficiencies and candida, do you know what your hemoglobin number is? Are you anemic?"

5,Vegan Catlady,121,"Wow, this is making so much sense! I am willing to bet there is a direct connection with low iron/anemia/low hemoglobin and candida overgrowth, and especially with bacterial infections like impetigo and staph. Anemia and Infection Daniel M. Musher + Author Affiliations Infectious Diseases Section, Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center, and Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas Reprints or correspondence: Dr. Daniel M. Musher, Infectious Diseases Section (11/G), Veterans’ Affairs Medical Center, 2002 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030 ([email protected]). Sir—Talbot et al. [1] ask whether a need for perioperative blood transfusion predicts susceptibility to infection or whether a transfusion itself is somehow immunosuppressive. My interpretation is that anemia predisposes to acute bacterial infection. My colleagues and I [2, 3] have reported a strong association between anemia and infections due to gram-positive bacteria. In 17 (33%) of 52 patients with bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia and in 10 (21%) of 48 patients with nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, the hemoglobin level at the time of admission to the hospital was ⩽10 g/dL (the overall rate of anemia, based on a stringent definition, was 27%) [2]. Among patients with Staphylococcus aureus infection, 56% had a hematocrit of ⩽33% at the time of referral to an infectious diseases service for consultation [3]. Maintaining a high hemoglobin level and high oxygen saturation significantly reduces the risk of progression to death for patients who have severe sepsis or septic shock [4]. We may not know the mechanism, but I do believe that a low hemoglobin concentration predispose to acute bacterial infection, probably by means of reduced oxygen saturation at potentially infected sites. http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/11/1731.2.full"

0,BethanyAlaska,122,"Hi, Chiropractor has indicated I need to do the Candida diet, and after reading more I am amazed that it covers all of my symptoms that I thought were otherwise unrelated. I have basically been sick since I had my twin girls two and a half years ago. For the first year and a half I thought it was just sleep deprivation, the stress of emigrating (moved from the UK to AK) etc. Then started trying to find the root cause and met a lot of dead ends, thought it might be iron or vit d deficiencies, then food allergies. Then I started having liver problems and the Chiropractor mentioned leaky gut and asked whether I struggled with yeast infections. I think we might have found the answer! I’m trying to learn and plan how to do this properly, and have a few questions. I have bilateral joint disease in my jaw joints, as well as displaced discs and hair line fractures. Very painful. To keep it under control I do a largely liquid based diet. If it isn’t liquid it has to be soft, mushy etc. To maintain my weight and stay healthy I rely largely on a product made by Garden of Life, Raw meal replacement powder which I mix up with soy or almond milk. Looking at the ingredients, it has 7g of sugar in, and a host of foods that I shouldn’t be having on a Candida diet, powdered berries, rice flour, bean sprouts, the list goes on. http://www.gardenoflife.com/Products-for-Life/Foundational-Nutrition/RAW-Meal.aspx Would it be possible to still heal my gut while using the meal replacement? Or has anyone come across a liquid meal replacement which is suited to the Candida diet? http://www.amazon.com/Garden-Life-Candida-Vegetarian-Capsules/dp/B0044AJURQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top Would this product my Garden of Life, Raw Candida Cleanse, be a good pro biotic to use? If not is there one people would specifically recommend? I haven’t taken any probiotics before. I take calcium supplements with added vitamin D. And the Chiropractor recommended Niacin. On top of that I was planning to add magnesium and potassium supplements as I know I’m deficient in these. Is there anything else that I should be taking? Have been reading the forum for a few days and it seems that most people are taking a lengthy list of supplements? I’d be grateful for any other information you think might be helpful as I start out. Thanks 🙂"
1,Vegan Catlady,122,Sounds like you have a great chiropractor 🙂
0,Marisb12,123,"I have researched non stop and came across this site. I have read many of your posts, discussions and stories. It is such a relief to know that I am not alone! I would like to begin my story with a background of myself. I am 28 years old and have always been a positive outgoing social butterfly. My entire life despite many traumatic events as a child, have always kept a positive outlook of life and was active. Then I turned 26. In one year I was laid off from my state job of 5 years, got married, started a new job, bought a house and lost my father to cancer. Followed by a year long law-suit with my estranged half sister. During the duration of these events I was getting reoccurring sinus infections and UTIs (never had this before), I was getting severely depressed, had horrible panic attacks (I always had this but was able to overcome them)and was constantly irritable on top of so many other symptoms. For the past 6 months I have been experiencing severe sinus pressure and swelling in my head. My ears would constantly burn, low grade fever, migraines….argh! Complete torture. I went to three different doctors, two ENTs, endocrinologist, gyno, eye doctor….the list goes on and on. With every test they had me take I passed with flying colors. It was coming down to the point where I was praying SOMEONE would finally find SOMETHING wrong with me. Ultimately two of the doctors decided from all my stress I was becoming depressed, showing somatic symptoms and was given a script for Zoloft. I have NOTHING against anti-depressants or anti-psychotics if the patient needs them, I work for a Medical Research Center and have patients using these to help with their conditions. However, being in the field I am in I knew this wasn’t an episode of depression and something much more was going on. So I tore up my script and was determined to educate and diagnose myself. Fast forward to present, my husband and I planned a much needed vacation. We drove down to Florida from New York to board our cruise ship headed for paradise, but unfortunately we never made it aboard. An hour after we arrived I was passing out and the pressure in my head was so bad I couldn’t see straight. We rushed to the hospital where they decided it was just sinusitis and I was “fine”. They put me on an antibiotic (feeding my yeast) and by the second day I felt worse. We decided it was best to head back home to NY and seek someone in alternative medicine. I had my appointment yesterday and THANK YOU GOD….was told I have candida. I was so excited and happy that I was about to do back flips, IF my joints didn’t hurt me and I didn’t feel like my 85 year old grandmother! This has been such a difficult struggle for me and especially my family. I am only married 2 1/2 years and my marriage was/is suffering so badly from this that divorce was mentioned a few times. My ‘friends’ had called me a hypochondriac, that I was crazy and complaining too much. Needless to say those people don’t bother with me anymore (talk about showing your true colors!). In the light of the situation, I am ecstatic that I have finally been diagnosed and can begin my journey towards recovery. It has given me a new outlook on health and also shined a light on who I can really count on! If you read my story, thank you for reading! Sorry if I rambled or did not make sense, this is my first time on a forum. 🙂 Looking forward to ‘meeting’ all of you and sharing experiences! Sending you positive energy, peace and blessings! XoX -Marisa"

Some of your symptoms are very familiar to me. Sinus pressure, migraines, fever like symptoms, … What are your plans on curing candida? Take care!"
2,Marisb12,123,"Thanks TheChosenOne! Sorry you struggled for so long! I am following up with my doctor on Wednesday to have a sit down, go over each and every symptom, all of my results (that returned normal) and then devise a game plan. The practice I chose actually specializes in Candida, so I know I am in good hands! They explained that I will be placed on a personalized program to rid the yeast overgrowth and I will report weekly for progress visits. The duration of this program is based on my progress. I will post back here after my appointment to share! 🙂"

8,Marisb12,123,No problem! And as soon as I find out what their process/plan is I will post on here! Good luck to you! 😀
9,Bike girl,123,"I just looked on the link, looks good, lucky you! I don’t know if we have this sort of thing in the UK."
10,Marisb12,123,Thank you! I just really hope it helps! I am willing to try anything! You should google alternative medical clinics or perhaps candida specialists in the UK. That’s what I did and I found these people! I hope you find something/someone!
11,Bike girl,123,"Aww bless. I would never of thought of trying somewhere like this at all. We do have a Chinese type herbalist in town, you know that says excema, stress and loads of other problems on the window. it would really be worth a visit even just to ask them.  I will Definately pay them a visit and let you know. I did suggest to my dermatologist is the rashes fungal and he said there is no evidence candida causes rashes. Gps in the uk I don’t think have enough knowledge of candida. The fruit and wheat you do think you are eating it for the best, I think cutting these things out can lead to other problems it’s a catch 22 situation isn’t it. I got oral thrush in March never had it in my 48 year life lol I was disgusted in myself, I think it was probiotic drinks high in sugar and tons of fruit I was eating ooh and cakes, I find cutting them out hard work but I haven’t had any sweet things today! I hope you see them soon to help you. X"
12,Marisb12,123,"I would definitely look into it. The doctors here in the states do not recognize candida too, my primary doctor actually laughed at me when I suggested it. Just because they cannot refer back to a medical journal they feel it doesn’t exist. The specialist doctor i went to explained all of this to me. As for fruit and wheat, I’m not cutting anything out of my diet until the medical team gives me my regime to follow. From what I have read these things feed into the yeast, that you would only have to cut them out for 7-10 days to kill the yeast and then reintroduce foods again along with a pro-biotic. I don’t know, what I am reading could be completely wrong for me. But I will definitely post up everything the doctors say. I actually get the opposite and am always cold, night chills especially. Keep me updated with the herbalist! I’m very interested to hear what they have to say! Best of luck to you! 🙂"
13,Marisb12,123,"Just wanted to post an update for everyone! I went to the doctors on Wednesday, they put me on a strict diet of no dairy, no carbs, no sugar, no soy, no eggs…the list goes on and on! Later on tonight if anyone is interested I will post a complete list of the dos and don’ts I received. So far I have been experiencing less sinus pressure but still symptoms are present. I am definitely hopeful!"

0,bouncygal,124,"I’m not saying take my advice but this is my story, Well i would have to say i made it aprox 6 months on the candida diet before i started to question myself whether the candida diet was the right path for my body, i got increasingly sicker and tired like never before,i always had a soft stool, i lost my muscle tone, couldn’t work & even lost my job mid way through, i wasn’t feeling better, the candida diet made me feel worse and i kept blaming the candida for it all. I believed so intently on no sugar, no fruit and all the other no,no,nos. I didn’t care how sick i was getting i must be on the right path, something that made me feel this crappy surly would give me a HUGE reward! i kept telling myself and others I became a regular reader of this forum…. I went out one night about 3 weeks ago and saw this girl dancing, doing amazing energetic moves the way i used to be before the ‘candida diet’ so i jumped up and tried to bust out my regular dance tricks, but i couldn’t keep up, i was a granny at 24 i had lost my happiness and my ability to express myself though dance, i was changing, i was’sick’ girl. Before i had just had thrush, now i had thrush and i was the “sick” girl and this made me depressed. Then one night i had pumpkin soup and i felt amazing its as if every part of me was smiling on the inside, it felt right and i tried a couple of more times, and then carrot,low sugar berries i started having energy thinking clearly,started to pass nice sold stools, exercising every day getting on with life and dancing again. I say listen to the body and balance seems to work with life so why not the gut? Long term deprivation is not balance don’t fool yourself. Now its not all doom and gloom for the candida diets roll in my life. During the candida diet i did get rid of my face pimples & my other skin condition. But maybe, just maybe this was because of cutting out gluten or dairy or even cutting out refined sugar and less to do with the candida diet in whole. I cured wasn’t before i started, or after i finished, BUT i feel so much better now.I am introducing foods back slowly though just so i can find anything that might irritate me, because its obvious something was & is. I will get better with balance, this is my new theory. I’m also eating smaller meals though out the day so my digestive system isn’t over loaded. I will have a sugar diet, but no refined stuff and i’m not going to overdo it on the fruit. Slowly and respectfully wins the race. XXX BOUNCY Learning form this journey, not the destination.

1,Vegan Catlady,124,"A total fan of this attitude. I hate to admit it, but I am a fruit-freak. If I have to live without fruits, I dont wanna live. Carbohydrates/sugar feeds the brain. It gives us energy. Depression lifts. Im glad you posted, this gives me hope."
0,annasylt,125,"Hi there I just joined the forum. I have systemic Candida for the second time after taking 3 or 4 courses of antibiotics for a recurrent bladder infection. I took caprylic acid for about 7 weeks but have stopped for a while as the die-off symptoms got too hard to handle. As I also have a mouth full of amalgam fillngs I am also wondering about the Candida-amalgam connection. At the moment I am still getting vaginal thrush and bladder problems really often. I use d-mannose for my bladder now, but keeping the thrush under control is not easy. It’s easy to feel like giving up some days.

0,cburke007,126,"Hi everyone, I just registered with the site, though I have been a lurker here and on curezone and various other sites for the last couple of years. Here is my story, sorry but it is a long one… I believe I have suffered from an impaired gut ecology and auto-immunity since a very young age. I suspect it could be somewhat hereditary as well since diabetes, heart disease and death at a young age run in my father’s side of the family. My maternal grandfather had intestinal cancer that resulted in the removal of most of his intestines and a colostomy bag. As a small child I had constant ear infections with swollen lymph which eventually led to removal of my tonsils at around age 5. Later around age 11 I contracted Hepatitis, but they couldn’t tell what strain it was (this was in the mid-80’s), but based on the severity and extreme jaundice I had it seems to best match Hep-A. I have tested a few times for Hep-C and have never shown any anti-bodies for it thankfully. Shortly after my run-in with Hep, I started developing eczema on my face around the eyebrows and nose. At first I was able to get by with lotions, but eventually it got inflamed enough we sought a dermatologist. They unfortunately believed then, and still do, that eczema is a topical infection, and their prescription was steroidal cortisone cream. I used their prescription stuff, but when it ran out and the eczema was still there I went to OTC hydrocortisone cream, which I continued to use on my face for roughly 20 years. I finally weaned my self off of it slowly about 4 years ago and started using a more natural non-steroidal cream. In 2006, I came down with a cough that just would not go away. I was eating so many hall’s that I was making my self nauseous, and could not control the cough. I went to my GP and he prescribed a Z-pack. 2 days into the Z-pack I started developing tingling in my toes. it started working its way up my legs to the point that I knew I needed to go back to my GP and find out what was going on. By the time I was going for the MRI, my left eye would no longer move left and the numbness was up to my waist. The MRI showed that I had immune system activity and inflammation in my cortex and spine. The “soft” diagnosis was MS and the initial treatment was a very strong steroid. Over the 6 weeks I took the steroid the numbness (and by then muscle weakness) quit advancing and by week 4 started receding. During the treatment I found lots of info about mercury fillings and their potential to cause issues like this. Once the treatment was over and the symptoms gone, I had 11 fillings replaced with non-metal fillings. Thankfully the symptoms have not returned, despite my doctors’ insistence that I needed a spinal tap and probably lifelong treatment for MS. That was 7 years ago. 3 years ago in late 2010, I had a tooth infection which I decided to get a root canal (That may or may not have been a good idea). I had one previous to this, and I have had another since, right next to the second one. During the round of Amoxicillin for the root canal in late 2010, I developed clay colored stools, lightheadedness, feelings of low blood sugar, scary stuff. I contacted my dentist and he recommended I start taking a probiotic so I did. I did some research and ended up starting on a 15bil CFU multi-strain probiotic. Within 2 days I was feeling better, my skin had completely cleared up on my face and was soft and smooth, something I had not experienced since I was a kid. My hair had also become much softer. It was very strange. However, on the 5th day I started to notice little tingling in my finger tips, but didn’t think too much of it. Each successive day it got worse and I noticed my skin on my arms was becoming less sensitive to touch and immediately started to panic that it was the MS again. I quit taking the probiotic and went to the emergency room. They ran lots of tests, but couldn’t find anything so just ended up recommending going back to my GP. Naturally my GP scolded me for no following up on my follow-up MS testing and sent me back for another MRI. Come to find out I was clean in that respect. He also sent me to a neurologist and Gastro doc due to the clay color stool and diarrhea which he informed me were indicative of serious liver inflammation, and possible gut bacterial infection. Got nothing from any of the neurologist testing/bloodwork. The gastro doc did more bloodwork given that I have a history of elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin that my GP never thought worthy of diagnosing. He also sent me to get an abdominal sonogram to check out my liver. There we found that I did have some minor fstty infiltration of the liver. This was most likely due to my being overweight and alcohol usage history. Other than that he had nothing to go on to explain the neurological symptoms I was having and even suggested that it might be all in my head and to speak with my GP about that. At that point I was out thousands of dollars, had no outcomes other than what can only be construed as ridicule and belittling, especially when I mentioned the possibility to my GP of my symptoms being related to a potential yeast overgrowth and the resultant die-off being caused by the probiotic. It was at this point I sought out a naturopathic MD, but I had to wait a month and a half to get in to see him. During this time I continued to research and experiment. I had quit using the probiotic, and after several days I started developing bad rashes in underarms and most unmentionable cracks in the body. When I started taking the probiotics again the rashes would slowly dissipate. However, I found that continuing to try the 15bil CFU probiotic would, after just 3 days, start to give me very strong side effects of skin numbing, my complexion got pale, and I would feel drunk. This lead me to stop taking them and start finding some much lower dose. Around February of 2012, I started taking a homeopathic sulphur remedy that my naturopathic doctor had prescribed, and I had stopped taking probiotics and any anti-fungals for a 2 week period so I could get tested for Candida (which came back at only +1, almost non-existent). However, after the first dose of the Sulphur remedy, 6 hours later I started feeling very flush and my skin became splotchy. Within a day I had full blown urticaria over most of my body. I looked like I had a bad sunburn (and felt like it). It itched like mad and was very scary. This continued for about 4 weeks. I was scared to try any more probiotics or antifungals because we could not determine a root cause and I wrongly thought it might be the good guys. Finally at 4 weeks I decided to experiment with L-glutamine because I had read that urticaria can be caused by leaky gut. I also started on a 1bil probiotic pearl. The next morning my redness had immediately started calming and my skin started to dry and flake. Within a couple of days most of the urticaria had gone leaving behind some specific patches that finally healed over the course of many months. Unfortunately I found that I cannot tolerate L-Glutamine. After just a couple of days of 1g doses I develop bad headaches, inability to think clearly, fatigue. So when I take glutamine it is in smaller doses and infrequent. I haven’t taken any in a while. It was at this time that I had discovered that I had overnight become intolerant of the vast majority of foods. I could no longer eat gluten, dairy (casein), yeast (incl. Kefir and S.Boulardii), honey (pollens), as these all exacerbated my urticaria symptoms and added heart palps, elevated BP, panic attacks, etc. I had already cut out fruits and sugars due to extreme bloating, numbness and brain fog symptoms whenever I would consume any sugar or starchy veg. That was in Mar 2011. It took me about 2 weeks to get over the low blood sugar issues associated with cutting sugar out of my diet and converting to fat as a fuel. I lost about 30 pounds in about a month and a half once I was forced into an elimination diet. It was bad enough that I, and many around me, were wondering if I had come down with some sort of cancer. So fast forward to Sept 2012. By this time, I had slowly worked up to 4bil CFU probiotic and a product designed to consume candida, called Candisol. After a month on the Candisol, and not seeing significant improvement (yeah, I should have given it longer), I decided to test the theory that maybe I had given myself SIBO when I first started taking the probiotics and had been nursing it ever since. I decided to stop the probiotics and Candisol. After a few days I felt much better. No more die-off symptoms, the rashes had already cleared up during the probiotics and Candisol treatment the month of September, and they weren’t coming back. It seemed like maybe I was OK. Then we had a company get together with some of our customers. I wound up drinking some wine and eating some desserts which included gluten and of course sugar. I was out of work the next 2 days and all of my symptoms were back with a vengeance. I started to lose weight again, except this time it coincided with hyperthyroid symptoms. Blood tests showed my T levels were out of whack along with constant hunger, cold sweats, jitteriness, light-headedness. It felt like low blood sugar issues again, but that wasn’t it. My tri-glycerides were also elevated (which was one of the things that had always been good for me), and my liver enzymes, which had been back in the normal range on my previous blood work, was elevated again. During this time I spent the money on another round of tests, which included the leaky gut challenge (negative), the DMPS heavy metals challenge (negative for high metals), and the Metametrix GI Effects analysis (High Prevotella bacteriodes, low Lacto, VERY low Bifido, but no pathogenic bacteria/parasites/yeast found). I have spent the last 12 months trying to get back to where I was last September and I think I am finally there. Earlier this year I fermented some sauerkraut and started with 1/4tsp of juice which gave me bad die-off, and slowly increased from there and grew into sub-dividing my Bio-Kult probiotic capsules into 250mil doses. It looked like I was cutting up lines of coke on my mirror, lol. I am back on 4 bil every day now. I have been trying to add back different antifungals with very little success (success being I can still function at work). I work in a high output job for a large hosting company, and the vast majority of my work is mental. If you google my forum name you can probably suss out what I do. Die-off, and having a strong percentage of my mental processes focusing on weird sensations, dizzyness, itching or twinges of pain that continually crop up, make my job extremely difficult. I also frequently have congestion in my ear that results in weaping of a yellow-ish fluid that results in inflammation of the inner ear and scaling and peeling of the skin in my ear. This is usually coincident with sore/swollen lymph nodes directly under my ears. Some of the anti-fungals I have tried in the past: – Grapefruit Seed Extract – Massive skin numbness, tight back and shoulder muscles, heart palps, throat muscles sometimes feeling tight. – Olive leaf extract – lightheadedness within 10 minutes of drinking a dose mixed with water, numbeness, tight back and shoulder muscles, heart palps – Candisol (have also tried Candidase and Candex with the same reaction) – More gentle action, but generally results in MORE stronger food intolerances that I wasn’t having problems with before. Also leaves me feeling as if I have eaten yeast products, see text above for what that does to me. My suspicion is that it is dead yeast left over after the cellulase is consumed that is being absorbed back into my system which then produces the same effect as if I had eaten the yeast. – Cocount oil. I use this every day in cooking. I used to eat it by the spoon before cooking with it. When I first started taking it I had the same numbness and muscle issues as other anti-fungals – Candigone – This one was very mild. Very minor effects the first couple of days, nothing after that. I did a couple of rounds of this stuff and given the ingredients I expected to be knocked on my ass. It may work, but I can;t say it did anything for me. – Paragone – same thing as Candigone – Caprylic acid tablets – very bad brain fog, numbness, heart palps, muscle stiffness – Nystatin – I got my naturopath to prescribe this for me last fall. I started with a small dose of 1 tab per day. On day 3 I was at the grocery store and the lights started to get bright and I started noticing I was getting dizzy and having bad heart palps where it was very irregular and skipping. I started thinking I was having a heart attack, but I didn’t have any of the common pain symptoms. I put down everything and went for the exit and went home. I got into an epsom salt bath and used the toilet. I started feeling better, but the symptoms were still pretty strong. I have not taken it again. Something I have not mentioned yet is that when my die-off symptoms get really bad, I will have occasional periods where my whole body will start to weaken and go numb and I will start to feel like I am going to pass out. Shortly after I start to feel the urge to go to the bathroom. Once I do that I am always feeling better in about 30 minutes, not tip-top, but no longer panicking. It is VERY scary, but from what I have researched I believe it may be toxic buildup in the colon and as it nears the exit, any remaining toxin filled water is reabsorbed through the hepatic portal vein. No idea if it is true or not, but seems to make logical sense. Going low and slow with my probiotics and anti-fungals seems to keep these episodes at bay. I cannot take Psyllium or Apple Pectin as they both give me hives and other allergic reactions. So my ability to expedite the elimination process is impaired. I generally go 2-3 days between. Occasional enemas help to move things along, something I never in a million years would have though I would even try, but desperation often wins those battles. I bought an infrared sauna earlier this year (based on McComb’s recommendation) and use it whenever I start feeling toxic, followed up by some electrolytes and an Epsom salt bath. This usually makes me feel a good deal better. Funny thing is when I am feeling particulary die-off toxic, when I get out of the Epsom salt bath I usually have little red dots on the underside of my forearms that itch. My shins also itch pretty bad. They go away within about 30 mins, but I have always taken that as toxins leaving the body. I don’t get them when I am not feeling too bad. I have been down the road of GAPS (during the massive urticaria phase and some time after), SCD, Bee Wilder’s site, McComb’s site of which I cannot do the diet due to the food intolerances and inability to eat any of the rice or fruit and I cannot do the Undecylenic acid without the probiotics as the constipation would absolutely destroy me. My diet for as long as I care to remember has been meat, eggs, low starch veg (primarily zucchini or cooked to mush green beans), and water. Food has become my enemy. If I didn’t have to eat to survive I would quit today. I am currently about to start trying undecylenic acid again. Previously I have tried it and just one cap 2 days in a row leads to debilitating numbness, heart palps, brain fog, and muscle cramping in my back and shoulders. That has been a couple of months and much lower doses of probiotics ago. I am hoping it will go better in a week when I try again. Last year when I was at 4 bil previously I was able to withstand anti-fungals a little better. Hopefully that holds true, but back then I had been at 4bil for longer than I currently am. Anyways, sorry for the long diatribe, but I wanted to get it all out there. I look at my whole health history as being related to my current situation. I am keen to figure this thing out and get back to 100%. I consider myself an expert troubleshooter by trade and use self experimentation to poke and prod and find what works. I have been completely cured of any desire for the SAD diet. I have no interest in sugar, bread, alcohol or any other pleasurable food. Maybe someday, but right now they cause nothing but suffering and a shorter, unenjoyable, life. Being the sole income for a family of 5 (a wife of 18 years and 3 boys aged 12, 9, and 6) I NEED to find the fix for this so I can enjoy living again. We moved to London for my job in Jan of this year, and this illness has made it incredibly difficult to enjoy our time here exploring and doing things we should be doing in a foreign land full of endless history. I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy… If you made it this far, thanks for reading!"

I suspect it could be somewhat hereditary as well since diabetes, heart disease and death at a young age run in my father’s side of the family. The history of heart disease stands out to me — heart disease can be a risk of high homocysteine levels, which in turn can be associated with genetic defects in your MTHFR enzyme. Defects in MTHFR can cause your methylation cycle to be off. The user ‘impossible’ has been posting a lot about this in recent weeks. Check out some of his posts. Cheers, CS"
2,raster,126,"Well the way I look at it is you have multi-pronged health problems. You don’t have enough beneficial gut flora caused by prior antibiotic use. You likely have a methylation cycle problem which impairs a variety of things within the body. The thyroid is likely impaired slightly and is under-performing. The main thing that sticks out to me is that you also very likely have a general toxicity problem. This is why the sauna helps so much, because it helps you detox via the skin, the bodies largest organ. Your elevated liver enzymes indicate that your liver is being stressed and if the toxins remain in the body, then you will feel bad essentially. You never really focused on detoxing the toxins it sounds like to me and this is something you need to focus on in my opinion. Healing the liver affects so many things in the body, its the final organ in the body in the long process of digestion. This is why you develop skin problems because your liver cannot detox properly, and so your body has to detox via the skin or via the lungs. You likely have a variety of flora that have overgrown and not just candida. Microbes, parasites, bacteria, strept, etc. You could have flora located in places that it shouldn’t be (like SIBO) and this could cause problems. It also sounds like you have a hard time dealing with die-off and that it completely messes you up. This is unfortunate and I would stress that you need to come up with a detox plan to address this. If you can do the sauna every day when you take antifungals, and help address the liver, then you should feel pretty good when compared to your prior experiences. Because of this, you will have a hard time making a dent in the candida and/or other bugs that have overgrown and you won’t make very much progress. I personally went through the same symptoms and in my opinion you just gotta tough it out because its only temporary (typically). My suggestions for you would be to heal the liver, go back to your naturopath, consider continuing with the sf722 (undecenoic acid), and try out a human derived strain of probiotic. The most popular human derived probiotic is HMF neuro and you haven’t ever tried this it sounds like. In canada there is another human derived probiotic that contains 6 strains. I think getting the human derived strains is very important in getting better. -raster"
3,BethanyAlaska,126,"Absolutely no advice, total novice to this. But I just wanted to say I did read all your post, and you have my admiration. What a terrible time you have had, what a burden on your shoulders. I really hope that some real answers and solutions are close at hand for you. In the mean time, take pride in the fact that you have provided for your family through all this, that takes some real strength of character."
4,cburke007,126,"CS, Thanks for the suggestion around the methylation. I will check out impossible’s posts. I do believe most of my issues are liver detox related. Raster, I do have a fairly rigid detox regimen. I didn’t add that to my diatribe above, but multiple times a day I take molyb, pantethine, vit c, NAC, Milk thistle, vit D (I tested low), a product called detoxication factors that my naturopath had prescribed me for phase I and II liver detox support. I have also been trying to readd another supplement he prescribed a long time ago called lipotrophic complex which is designed to assist the methylation, but I have been having some strong symptoms in conjunction with taking it and have not been sure if it was the supplement or other things I was doing at the time. Both of the last products are by integrative therapeutics. Now that my last bout of dieoff seems to be dissipating, and I am stable on my probiotic dose, I will try to add it in again a week before I start playing with the undecylenic acid again. The detox factors have been key to getting my probiotic doses up. Before I reintroduced them I was stagnating at just 500mil cfu. Once I started them I was able to start moving up in probiotic dose again to where I am now. I also drink decaf green tea and dandelion tea pretty regularly. Despite all of the above I still really struggle with die off which is where the sauna and epsom salt come in. I will definitely look further into the methylation stuff and make sure the lipotrophic complex I already have contains what I need to get it going better. I will also look into the human derived probiotics. I currently take Bio kult which is the one recommended on GAPS and it has done ok for me, but I am always up for trying a new one as long as I don’t end up backsliding. That would just destroy me at this point. Unfortunately, my Naturopath is in San Antonio. Now that I live in London I have really struggled to find one locally. Bethany, thank you for your kind words. I can’t take all the credit. Without my wife cooking my meals and running our house I would be screwed. The toll this illness takes on me brings me home from work just exhausted, and feeling toxic most days. It is hard to have any energy for the rest of the family, which just adds to the feelings of guilt that keep me on the border of depression and feelings of hopelessness. I just take it a day at a time and hope each day that I can get through without having a panic attack in the middle of a meeting, or that I can actually think clearly when working with a client. This is some hardcore stuff…"

6,cburke007,126,"Wow, fantastic. That’s exactly what I needed. One question though. I see there are a lot of different specializations. What ones would you target specifically? One of the nutrition specialists on there I saw earlier this year, Antony Haynes, is listed as autoimmune conditions as a specialty, which is partially what I am dealing with even if the source of that autoimmunity is the dysbiosis itself. He did help me identify another possible cofactor in my illness, that I have high antibodies for epstein Barr and one of the herpes simplex viruses, from when I had mono as a teenager. The antibodies themselves don’t really prove that they are reactivated, but it could be a factor. The supplement he prescribed for me was humic acid, and took me off of probiotics and antifungals entirely to try to focus on getting the viral thing in check. It only made me feel worse, without the usual balance of feeling some improvement. Mostly it just elevated my blood pressure to a scary point at which time I stopped taking it and went back to treating myself by getting my probiotic dose up again. He did seem very good at what he does, but he does not specialize in dysbiosis specifically, so he seemed to struggle with what to do for me regarding the dysbiosis and especially the liver detoxing. There was no real discussion of that. I would think maybe the best place to start would be with someone that specializes in the gut, and hope they also understand detoxing and autoimmunity? Or maybe I need to see multiple docs?"

I don’t have any personal experience with nutritional therapists, but I’m assuming (perhaps incorrectly?) that they do not have the same level of education as an MD or ND. I also don’t know what all the credential acronyms (like ION and MRCP) mean next to some of those people. If it was me, I’d start with an MD or ND, probably someone with a specialty listed as general medicine or internal medicine, like Dr. Mantzourani, MD or Dr. Maizetova, ND. It certainly sounds like Haynes wasn’t up to the task for your particular issues. Here’s an article written by Dr. Hyman, MD on autoimmune problems.

0,Beat Candida,127,"In my 4 months of suffering. 2 Months of organized diet & 1 month of Trial & error type of diet initially. I have lost 53 lbs & counting. I was overweight before 249lbs 6ft tall. to Now 196lbs. Everyone around me thinks that I am in great shape but actually I feel so weak & my head just spins continuously. I feel so loose with no muscle content but then again i cannot even preform mundane tasks like Brushing my teeth without getting exhausted. 10 days ago I suddenly got an energy burst & started feeling a lot better, physically & mntally but it lasted for 6 days & then something happened & I started feeling terrible again. But those 6 days were a great sign of how great things can be & this road to recovery can definitely take me back to being normal. I felt so good that I was thinking of moving into phase 2, even the white tongue was becoming pink again, the weird hairs on the tongue vanished only the red tip was the last of the tongue symptom left but one morning I got up and all the old symptoms were back. I know that it is a long road to recovery but I desperately need to get a bit better soon for my family’s sake. I have not cheated at all , the closest thing to cheating was eating half of a green apple about a month ago when the weakness & fatigue was driving me crazy. My day goes like this: Morning : 3 Eggs(Veggie Omlette with Onions, Brocolli, Green chillies or fried or boiled). Chicory Tea. 1 small piece of Coconut bread. 250 mg Molybednum Amino Acid Chelate 400mg of Milk Thistle. Citramins (a good combinitaion of Minerals). 1000 mg of Vitamin C Vitamin B complex (A good combination of Vitamin B’s). HMF Neuro. Formula Sf 722 (I was taking Nystatin as the only other Anti fungal for last 3 weeks but am done now) Lunch: I tablet of Ashwaganda. Chicken or Fish with Super Veggies (Kale, Brussel Sprouts,Brocolli, |Chicory,Cabbage, Along with Green Peppers, ACV or Coconut Vinegar, Lemon, & sometime onions. Same set of the Vitamins & Minerals. But instead of Hmf Nuero I take L-Glutamine. LAte afternoon I take Chlorella (Powdered Form half teaspoon mixed with water) & I am upto 2 tablets of Sprulina. Nettle tea a bit afterwards. Dinner: Same combination as lunch sometime I go for Soba Noodles With Chicken. For Mineral & Vitamins: 1000g of Vitamin C 5 htp L- Glutamine Molybednum 500mg of Magnesium 2 tablets of Formula sf-722 (So 6 for the whole day). a few sips of homemade Kefir an hr after dinner. Then before going to bed I take Cammomile Tea & 5mg of Melatonin.(Still get very broken sleep). I will be bringing Oil of Oregano back this evening.(Tried it for a few days but the die-off was horrid, Also cannot consume Coconut oil so just get everything made using coconut oil. Do use coconut butter with the Bread. I am doing it based on Able/Raster & other great members help here at the forum & also based on the advice of my Natrupath. Hopefully I will feel better again soon."
1,bouncygal,127,"Hi i started my diet nearly 4months ago, funny i also had this bust of energy about a week ago, it was great it lasted 7days i worked 6 of them,i exercised, i was so much more happy…then i went back to the extreme fatigue…finding it hard to do the little things like sweep the kitchen floor…or brush my teeth like yourself. I hope it is a sign the diet is working i really do. People that have been though this are these bursts of energy part of the healing?????? are we the only ones who expirenced this??????"
2,myword12345,127,I would like to know the answer to that also. 2 months in last week I was feeling much better. I was so happy it was like ago next step. Now I feel like hell like when I started. weak stomach hurts bloated tongue all crazy head ach the list goes on. I started feeling bad again last night after I went to the bath room and lost 3 pounds doing it.
3,Beat Candida,127,As mentioned by Able/Sean this whole process can take anywhere between 6 to 18 Months(Possibly 18 in my case as it was pretty severe). At least we do see some signs of improvements as initially my problem was that all of this hardwork & all the symptoms were still exactly the same know we know that at we can eventually get better. The only thing which worries me is if some of the weird symptoms are the by product of the diet with next to no Carbs(My Family keeps implanting these doubts in my mind).
4,jayjonbeach,127,"I also had a similiar experience. After 2 weeks I started having “great mornings” like 2 days in a row, then 2 bad, 2 good etc. Then it turned to GREAT DAYS in a row! I was so excited, I not only felt the brain fog lifting but I had a general feeling of “well being” too and LOTS of energy, tons. This off and on went on for about 3 weeks, 2 good days, 2 crappy days. Then it was back to hell, for about 2.5 months or so of pretty much ALL bad days, brain fog and more brain fog and other crap. Which brings me to the last week or two (5 months total for me now), last week I had three good days FINALLY. They were not like before however, before it was like too good to be true maybe, so much energy, completely clear head and felt just so good, BUT, I was maybe feeling 70% which is a lot better than 25 – 40%. Anyway, I would also like to hear from people who have gone through these things, and what eventually happened"

My biggest issues are still lack of sleep even with taking a lot of sleep medication.Prescription & non Prescription. I am still taking Phase 1 diet with More CHicken & Fish But my Natrupath has given me St Francis LAbs Deep Immune Formula(Which has got Meltoodoxtrin) & it has helped me a bit with the Stomach Issues & also I have started taking Photophosidyl Serene to help me sleep & its ingredients include Soya Bean(It has helped me a bit with sleep) So those are my only cheats. I am still not sure if my sleep problems are the root cause of Candida or is Candida the root cause of all my problems. I do have Headaches from morning till night. Stomach is a bit better. Also,at the insitance of my wife & another doctor I also started taking Cipralex (An anti Depressent) too 15 days ago. I have also started taking Commercial Kefir & Coconut Milk without any major stomach issues recently. Will also be introducing Teff flour soon. I just could not stand the smell of Home Made Kefir which I tried for about a month and a half."

0,Viva,130,"Hello, I’m brand spankin’ new here, but am so thankful for all the posts available to look at and learn from. I am particularly amazed by the amount of help and time consistently given by the “experts.” Bless your hearts! I am a 32 year old mom to two little kids, but I’ve been suffering for a fair amount of time from many supposedly “unrelated things.” For a long time I had accepted I was just “that person” with poor luck in health. However, now I am pretty convinced that a lot of my health issues have been caused by a systemic yeast infection. My “unrelated symptoms” have included (and I’ve likely forgotten a couple!): CURRENTLY in “REMISSION”: Carb/Sugar cravings (ok, I guess I still have this to a mild degree, but it’s not like a feeding frenzy I used to get) Acne & Cystic Acne (put on antibiotics for at least 8 years straight by dermatologist…so sad in hindsight) BTW, my acne (20 some years of having it) is directly related to refined sugar. During my elimination diet, I would actually have the pimples swell under my skin within a couple hours of eating sugar. Canker sores (clear for a year now, since being refined sugar free) Bladder infections Ringworm Plantar cluster warts (cleared after years and years of treatment through dead-yeast injection shots) bizarre Melanoma skin cancer (8 years remission) Twitching fingers (just cleared with anti-fungal diet) Anxiety (stopped within two days of getting rid of the last illegal foods–fruit!) Yellow toenails: (cleared after my first Candida diet treatment a year ago) Low blood sugar: Most of my life I can remember feeling this if not fed carbs/sugar, although this was happening grain and sugar free for the past 6 months while having limited fruit and honey–I had to eat every hour to keep from feeling like I was dying. It was so scary. (stopped within two days of getting rid of last illegal foods–fruit!) Extreme fatigue (disappeared with getting rid of the last illegal foods–fruit!) CURRENTLY STRUGGLING WITH: Cold hands and feet White covered tongue (getting better with diet) Vaginal yeast infections (clear for at least a year until I restarted anti-fungals and diet)–now coming and going a lot all of a sudden IBS (diarrhea & nausea)  Many food intolerances/sensitivities (basically all grains, fruits, milk, cheese, sugar, sugar alternatives-even stevia!) Low blood pressure Low body temperature Mild fatigue Hypoprothrombinemia autoimmune blood disorder (I clot too slow and bruise very easily) Perioral dermatitis (appeared with first pregnancy and got worse with second pregnancy) Itchy scalp (appeared with first pregnancy) Black spots in vision upon standing BTW, when I get checked over for health (i.e. weight, blood pressure, blood testing) I score perfect. Something is not adding up! I was on the stage 1 candida diet in June 2012 and many of my symptoms reduced dramatically within a month. However, I lost 15 pounds…not having a ton to give away…and it wouldn’t stabilize (any more and I would have below BMI guidelines), so I then started adding other foods into my diet (especially gluten-free grains)–through an elimination-type diet. I then thought I just had food sensitivities and strictly eliminated all gluten, corn, nuts, dairy, and once maybe every couple months had sugar (but it was always hard to have just that ONE gluten-free cookie–the sugar/carb frenzy would come back with a vengeance). But over the year, my “cured symptoms” began to show up one by one and increase in intensity (especially if I cheated with sugar). Overall, I was VERY strict, although I was not using any antifungals and even stopped taking probiotics at one point. This spring (when it got warmer), my symptoms got downright horrible again. Over the past ten years I have seen many doctors and specialists–but no one has ever treated me for yeast. This summer I saw a holistic minded chiropractor and he gave me broad spectrum parasite/yeast/bacteria supplements, but he didn’t give me much for diet guidelines. I am almost ready to start. I am concerned about maintaining my weight and nutritional needs. What little weight and muscle I gained over the year has been lost since eliminating grains, honey, and fruit this summer. If I’m not on a regular multivitamin, I lose my hair…so making sure I am getting all my nutritional needs is of utmost importance to me. I also know I need to get better at handling social situations with food…they are emotional roller coasters for me. Of course, one of my good friends is a nutrionalist and thinks I’m being too defensive and close-minded about food. My husband who is in healthcare also thinks I need to have foods in moderation (like fruit, grains, potatoes). And my mom is always commenting about my weight and how concerned she is. So I guess I just need get over my people-pleasing ways and do what I know is right for me. In short, I am ready to take responsibility for my health and to become the person on paper I’m supposed to be… I’ll keep you updated. Thanks for listening. 🙂"
1,subtlesoul,130,Few things 1 would want to suggest: 1) Quinoa is a psudo grain. I eat that and i do not have any big reaction. Again each one is different but you could give it a try. 2) I eat only Fresh cooked food. I tend to have reaction with cold and heavy foods. 3) Are you drinking enough water? 4) If you have serious yeast infection may be you should consider talking to your doctor about prescription antifungals like Diflucan. 5) You could try topical application of antifungal cream called Clotrimazole 1% (over the counter at cvs) This has worked for me. 6) You can also try deep breathing excercises and yoga. Specially “Pranayama” Which is Yogic breathing. 7) Also you might want to include excercise into your routine. Most importantly “Listen to your body” Hope you get better soon 🙂
2,alexalgebra,130,"Take it from someone who has been at this for almost a year – the diet works if you stick with it! DO NOT CHEAT, DO NOT STRAY!! That’s the whole protocol, not just the diet – so probiotics, supplements, etc. Also, as far as the social stuff goes, it is definitely a struggle. I have had to find new ways to socialize with people that don’t revolve around food, like game nights. however, it’s actually opened up a whole new social circle for me, which has been pretty cool. Candida definitely helps you see who your real friends are :p With weight, you are just going to lose some. However, the good news is, it will come back! Just make sure you eat a lot of the fats on the diet – they are all good ones, like coconut oil, olive oil, and avocados. When you go through the first phase and detox though, a ton of weight will probably drop off. Just try to think about health and not weight, and think about balance…you were holding on to a bunch of toxins and crap, now you’re flushing it out, so the scale is tipped, and then you’ll replenish with health to come to where you naturally should be. I would not recommend doing a ton of exercise as your body heals, but definitely do some light and relaxing exercise like walking or yoga."
3,raster,130,"So I wouldn’t consume quinoa because its very hard to digest and benefits the yeast from my experience… Buckwheat groats are a great rice and quinoa replacement, similar texture, similar taste, but its a prebiotic that feeds the beneficial bacteria in the gut. One thing to keep in mind is that all of your health problems are likely not completely related to yeast alone. For instance the blood disorder may not be related to yeast. The dermatitis and ringworm may stick around even with an anti-candida protocol. For weight gain, I side with alex on it going away and then coming back. The body uses its resources to fight infection and once its under control, you will gain weight back. Also you need to increase the surface area of the gut in order to absorb more of the food you eat and this will allow you to gain weight. I started out at 135 pounds and now weigh 165 pounds. I was very very skinny starting this, went from 145 to 135 pounds and then gained it to the most I’ve ever weighed ever in my life (which is a good thing for me). I’d also check out teff which has great weight gain and nutritional properties: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1477_Introducing-a-new-baking-flour-TEFF-Flour.aspx If you were to eat big 3-4 course meals with snacking between them you likely will get all of the food you need daily. Some people think they are eating enough when they are not. Additionally, if you were to drink smoothies with a bunch of allowed superfoods in them, then this likely will bring the nutritional benefit you are looking for. Its also easy on the digestion. As far as the bad items, I would cheat occasionally to develop the gut flora that can break the food down. Maybe start out eating a potato/fruit once a month and eventually work your way up to once a week (or whatever works best). Use it as a special cheat item that you really look forward to. You don’t have to be super super strict, there is some space for the “bad” foods. Just not everyday. I would start add foods over time as you get better. It isn’t meant to be followed super strictly for a super long period of time. Some of the non-allowed foods do bring nutritional benefit and you don’t want to work yourself into a corner if things don’t go as good as you hoped (some people worsen when they try the candida diet). Hope this helps. Be sure to detox as good as possible this time around and then you will feel better than last time. -raster"
4,jennybear1978,130,"Hi Viva, Just wondering how everything was going with your symptoms now? It can definitely be a rough road, and frustrating, and confusing at times. I’ve been on the diet for just over a month now, and have had my symptoms go down to nothing, then my bladder infection-type symptoms keep coming and going, and every time I ask myself “is it something I’m doing in my diet”? So I understand the frustration. I also had low body weight to begin with, and have had trouble keeping the weight from coming off – feeling a bit close to skeletal now. Did you find something that worked for you?"
0,Bike girl,131,"Hi everyone, I only joined today and have been reading stories. Any advice on mine would be brilliant. I think I have candida, I have had an awful four years moving to where I do now having had to endure neighbour bullying by a narcissist and harrassment who thankfully has left her husband and moved out. The stress I had to endure was too much to cope with and I comfort ate a lot of sweet foods to cope. About April time when flossing I saw white patches in my back of my mouth and my excema had got so bad I went straight to the GP who gave me nystatin with a pippet which cleared it up but it came back he then gave me the gel which is hell to get off a cotton bud when I put it on. My excema got so bad I was and are still been treated at hospital, I have had it for twenty five years but it has covered over half of my body now. I got vaginal thrush, bloating, flatulence yuk, candida at corner of the mouth, fungal on my ear, itchy nipple, and bottom yuk, so I googled and came up with candida. My consultant gave me fluconazol which I don’t know if it has worked or not, as I still got thrush and itchy bottom so could it of worked does anyone know. I am trying to cut out sweet things, I biked over eighty miles per week so this makes me crave food for energy as well. My skin rashes don’t seem to have improved with the pills. I am a very stressed out person who worries so much which this then makes me crave things. I am so worried it will go to internal organs and I will die. My dr never suggested candida I suggested it to him. In Britain who do I see at hospital is it dermotology or nutritionist  I think my GP thinks I am mentally paranoid because I suggest Candida. I thought only very ill people got oral thrush. Any help would be lovely. x"
0,shayfo,132,"I’ve been taking a break from the forum lately, because I feel pretty secure in what I’m doing — and because I have the energy to be doing things other than staring at my computer! I’m feeling really good these days. All of my major symptoms — fatigue, brain fog, apathy, mood swings, irritability, “stagnant blood” feeling, sluggish digestion, overly soft bowel movements, insatiable cravings/hunger, tinea versicolor, occasional acne, gnarly PMS/menstrual pain, uncharacteristically low libido, itchy eyes, inability to lose weight, headaches — have improved significantly, and some have disappeared altogether. The only things I’m still dealing with currently are tinea versicolor, a bit of acne, some fairly mild menstrual pain, and a bit of an issue with project focus (although with my leisurely work schedule and hippie lifestyle, it’s hard to tell what’s habit and what’s candida, haha). I also have to limit my activity somewhat to keep myself from getting overly tired, but as an introvert, that’s a good habit to be in, anyway. After losing 18 pounds during the first two weeks of the cleanse, I maintained (and slightly regained) weight until about 3-4 weeks ago, and I’m down another 4 or 5 pounds in that time. I haven’t made my weight a priority during my treatment, because honestly, there are more important things, but it’s been interesting to know that other people are eating two or three times as much as I have been — and have been losing weight — while I’ve maintained weight. So it goes! Things I’ve learned: -it gets easier -to take things one day/hour/meal at a time -to observe my feelings when I watch people eat things I currently don’t eat without getting upset (usually!) -if I’m feeling ambivalent about being hungry, I’m probably hungry -how to be at parties sober again -not all coconut manna/butter brands are created equal -too much gf oat bran/buckwheat make me feel gross -how to make fluffy pancakes -yogurt is trying to kill me -I can’t seem to burn myself out on asparagus That’s pretty much it. Hooray four months!!"

Thanks a lot for the update, and it’s definitely a very positive move ‘up’ from where you were 120 days ago. By the way, I love your list of things you’ve learned. I think a lot of us, once we’ve grown use to a ‘healthy’ way of eating our meals, also observe other people eating their food choices with various feelings. I find myself often thinking, “God, they have no idea …” Then inevitably add to the thought with, “And they don’t even wanna know.” I hate that the Greek yogurt is still “trying to kill” you but you’re not alone in this as it seems to bother quite a few people throughout the treatment; my guess is because it’s commercially made, and we’re never really certain if the claims on the label are fact or fiction. Congratulations, Sean"
3,shayfo,132,"I haven’t tried Greek yogurt again since our initial run-in, but even the trace amounts of dairy in my coconut milk kefir (from brewing regular kefir for a friend to refresh my grains) was making me feel bad for a while, so I’m avoiding all dairy currently…which is fine, since I’m not a baby cow. Goat doesn’t seem to be as problematic, and I’ve been considering giving that another shot. We’ll see. I’m not a baby goat, either, but I guess I could pretend."

11,thudzina,132,Thank you this was an encouraging post. I have been on the diet and several natural health tablets for about 45 days. I have good and bad weeks. My weight has dropped quite a but goes up and down small amounts but mostly losing weight. On good weeks I feel amazing so this is all worth it. Symptoms have been sinus lower abdominal pain and lower back pain flu like feeling brain fog although they happen at different times not all at once symptoms seem to rotate depending on the week. I am gradually feeling better. Sometimes the weight loss concerns me although I am at what they say is in my optimum weight range for once in years but I keep losing weight. Have you experienced this and what can I eat to gain weight? Will the weight eventually stabilize?
0,shayfo,133,"So if the candida diet/protocol was a charming and virile gentlemen caller rather than a holistic medical treatment, I’d be ready to have our lovechild any second. I can’t believe it’s been nine months. Curious about my progress? For context, read: 8-month update 7-month update 6-month update 5-month update 4-month update My only remaining symptom is tinea versicolor. It had entirely cleared up a couple of months ago, but came back after a month of eating slightly too much fruit (dumb). You can read about that in my 8-month update above. I probably would have made better headway this month, because I was being somewhat more disciplined about that again, but I just spent a week in my hometown in Pennsylvania, and made some less-than-stellar decisions about fruit consumption (again, dumb). My mother has really lovely Mennonite neighbors who run a farmstand and grow, among other things, watermelons and raspberries, and goddamn it, everything is so good. And it’s apple season there. I didn’t gorge or anything, but I ate more than I should have. I stayed on probiotics, VCO, and brussels sprouts while there, cooked a lot more often than I have been (since I was making food for my mother and a friend as well as for myself most of the time, it encouraged me to eat more regularly), and ate very little of the diet’s approved carbs (I had buckwheat hot cereal twice and made tiny buckwheat pancakes once). I think these factors helped balance out my fruity indiscretions (not a gamble I recommend, by the way). My digestion doesn’t seem to have suffered, and I didn’t notice any other symptoms returning. I had some headaches while I was there, but they were obvious tension headaches and I suspect that was more a result of spending so much time around my mother and driving a lot than anything dietary. Now that I’m back in California, I’m planning on staying off fruit entirely for at least a couple of weeks, before I start eating tiny amounts a few times a week again. It’ll be easier to have discipline about this as the summer season wanes…goddamn stone fruit are so seductive, particularly when they’re free (something that happens in my life a lot). Keeping with the diet/protocol-as-baby-daddy metaphor, peaches would be the homewrecking interlopers. Instead of lipstick on my collar, they’re leaving tinea versicolor on my shoulders. Pretty incriminating. Before anyone suggests it, I’m not going to treat it topically — it’s my easily-visible barometer of my progress/setbacks. It’d be easy to lie to myself about (or subjectively interpret) symptoms like lethargy and digestion and mood and such, but spots on skin are spots on skin. Since I’m always learning in this process, here’s some MORE things I’ve learned: -Diet soda gives me a headache. I mean, duh, but I drank a diet root beer at a fancy brewery in Pennsylvania and a Coke Zero on a flight, and it happened both times. Fuck you, aspartame. -I’ve been thinking in the past month or so that a slightly overactive bladder was a candida symptom that’s cleared up. I noticed months ago that I wasn’t getting up to pee at night as often, but it didn’t occur to me that it could be candida-related until recently. Maybe it’s not, though its reduction occurred on the same timeline as a lot of my other symptoms improving/disappearing. -There are still people who ask me “Well, have you seen a doctor?” and think I’m being foolish for self-treating for a “fake”/nebulous condition, but simultaneously, there are far more people who have told me they really respect what I’m doing and that my dedication and discipline inspire them. -I need to spend some time thinking about people’s reactions to my weight loss this year. This is the first year of my life since I was probably 8 years old that I haven’t attempted to lose weight, but I’ve lost some anyway, of course. I’m under 200 pounds for the first time since 6th or 7th grade (started the diet at 228, and was 255-ish at my heaviest a few years ago before I quit eating gluten), and I’m getting a lot of compliments on my appearance, specifically my weight loss, and I’m conflicted about it. I hate that a lot of people seem to think this “diet” is a weight-loss diet, when that isn’t the point for me at all. I’m happy about my health currently because I FEEL better than I have in my entire life, while other people seem to just be glad that I conform much more closely to Anglo-normative beauty standards, with little interest in my health/wellness. Not to get all social-justicey on everyone, but I think on some level I feel complicit in fat-shaming by gradually dropping toward a weight bracket at which I won’t be a direct victim of such attitudes. I suspect I’m approaching my body’s “healthy” weight, since I’m actually getting healthy finally, but it’s new territory for me. It’s definitely something I need to think through and, I hope, find some resolution. -Now that I don’t have brain fog, I have time to fixate on intense subjects all the time :p -Baba ganoush makes life worth living. -Toasted sesame oil + cajun seasoning = AMAZING -I can make it through a whole week in rural Pennsylvania with my mother while stone-cold sober. I actually wasn’t sure. Questions/comments/critiques/sonnets of praise welcome, as always."
1,msmofish,133,"!!! THANK YOU !!! Your wit & candor are so refreshing ! I’m going back east next week & am terribly sad I can’t yet partake of the amazing apples in season now, how I miss them !!! Do you have a baba ghanoush recipe to share ?  A local Armenian market makes THE best baba ghanoush I’ve ever had, I’ve been afraid to go in while on this diet cuz I don’t want to know if there’s sugar in it or an ingredient I can’t have yet. It’s SO damn deelish ! How much VCO are you consuming ? And only through cooking or ingesting solo as well ? Thanks so much for sharing your experience strength & hope !! all the best Mo"
2,shayfo,133,"Most baba ganoush contains tahini, which you probably shouldn’t eat at 4 months. You could make your own without it and see if you like it that way — just roasted eggplant, EVOO, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and maybe paprika or cumin or something. I put smoked paprika in the batch I made in Pennsylvania, which was a mind-blowingly good idea. For a while, I was only ingesting VCO through cooking and/or adding on top of hot cereal, but recently I’ve conceded to keeping it in the fridge during hot weather to avoid how gross it is when it’s half-melted, and I’ve been eating more as a result. I would guess that between cooking and eating it straight, I’m probably consuming 3-6 tablespoons most days. I should find a Middle Eastern market to buy my baba ganoush from instead of goddamn Whole Foods, but Long Beach isn’t really the right part of LA County for that. Maybe I’ll venture out farther."
3,raster,133,One thing you should look at is the link between consuming aspartame and gaining weight. You’ll be surprised about how many articles and studies there are on the subject. It would be better to consume the non-diet stuff that contains sugar. Anyways its not a major problem for you right now but don’t play into the mindset that diet means its better. -raster

0,vadimo,134,"Dear community, I just joined and I have a couple of questions… First of all, here is my story: I believe I have candida (did the spit test and I failed). I have just turned 30 and am male. My symptoms are: GERD and esophagitis (confirmed by an oral endoscopy), I easily get cold hands and feet, blocked nose, flue like symptoms, lack of energy, IBS symptoms and soft stools (used to have diarrhea but that got better and IBS symptoms also got better, as well as my energy levels but still low). One of the most telling factors is the state of my tongue which if I don’t brush for 2 days will clearly have a thin layer of yellow/green/white foam/mucus and it is slightly enlarged, I have teeth marks on it. My main issue is the esophagitis inflammation and I would do anything for it to go away… I have been feeling ill since I moved to London a few years ago, but back then I believe a lot had to do with depression and the of course the bad diet I was following. I used to get throat infections which never seemed to go away unless I took anti-biotics, so every 5/6 months or so I had another infection and another dose of anti biotics… I started taking anti depressants 6 years ago, and felt better on and off but it helped me get by (was still getting the infections every so often but just in a better mood and slightly more energy). In Jan. 2012 I went on holiday for the NY in Brazil, I got food poisoned, went on Anti Biotics, the doc also gave me a medication that made me really dry (kind of an amphetamine), I didn’t sleep for 2 days, got back to the UK as sick as a dog and went to see my GP who told me I was given 6x the max recommended dosage of that drug and along with the anti-biotics, I feel this finally ended up messing my system to the point that throat issues became chronic and constant as opposed to temporary. On top of that, that year, 2012 I must have had at least 7 throat infections and was probably 6x on anti biotics from Amoxicilin to penicillin… By December 2012 I was a mess, not to mention stress at work and in my private life! Something had to change… I used to be a very sporty person, as a kid I was in top football (soccer) teams, and was always an energetic person, and here I was feeling almost paralysed, on my bad days, getting up from bed to take a pee felt like moving mountains. By the end of December 2012, I first heard about the Hippocrates Institute based in Florida and started changing my diet, being a novice I may not have eaten enough proteins at the beginning but I threw away the anti-biotics (I had spares) and my anti depressants and got myself off ALL kind of chemical medicines and started eating much more greens and veggies. Unfortunately by then, and since Jan 2012 my throat pains became chronic and I didn’t know what it was. Here we are 9 and a half months later… I have not had a single throat infection this year and in the mean time, I was tested as having acid reflux (grade I or II so not that bad but there…) and I have slightly more energy than earlier on, went through the whole anti depressant withdrawal symptoms which was terrible but my mood is ok now. I wanted to get to the bottom of what caused my GERD and acid reflux, and the more I searched, the more I found that candida was probably to blame… I have started following the candida diet for a week now and am taking: “Udo’s Pro biotics 30 billion strains, Royal Reishi Ganoderma, “Total Candida defence” caprylic acid, garlic powder etc…, Neem pills, Cinnamon pills, digestive enzymes and a few other things… From what you have just read, and from your experience, what else could I be doing and how long do you all think this will take to heal? I am going back to Brazil in 14 days and will go see Joao de Deus there (I was curious anyway), and on the 3rd of October, 2 days prior, I will be going to see a Functional Doctor here in London called Dr. George Mouton. I’ve read lots of his reviews on the net and he seems like the right person for me or anyone having similar issues, but I am very impatient to get this sorted and take back the life that is/was mine. Looking forward to your responses. I am especially looking forward to hearing back from people who have been suffering from Candida caused GERD and Esophagitis who managed to heal themselves or on their way to it. Best, Vadim"
1,vadimo,134,"I forgot to add, I have just modified my diet to match a proper sugar free low carb diet just over a week ago now, and started taking the anti candida supplements at the same time, but so far there has barely been any improvement, and am feeling very tired today…"
2,Able900,134," Hello, Vadim. Your Udo’s probiotic doesn’t contain 30 billion strains; it contains 30 billion CFU’s or Colony Forming Unit. It probably contains around 8 strains. You’re going to have to find another type of probiotic with different and more strains as well as higher billions. Check your email account for more information. Sean"
3,shelly808,134,"Aloha Vadim, Wow, congratulations on a healthy comeback…Good for you for all the lifestyle changes. I hear very very good things about The Hippocrates Inst. What got me to the doctor was that terrible throat pain! It started over a month ago and got progressively worse. I also had this excess mucous in my throat that drove me nuts at night. I was diagnosed with Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (Silent Reflux) this past week. They gave me the typical prilosec and I’ve decided NOT to go that route. I started thinking about candida just today! I think there def may be a connection as I was on very heavy doses of antibiotics 2 years ago for an infection that got into my blood, was actually hospitalized. Since then I have gained 30 lbs and have had sugar cravings-big time. I decided to go with Garden of Life 5 Day Max care it has 400 billion CFU, raw probiotics and a product called Candex (heard its remarkable for Candida) Also doing bentonite clay in the A.M., Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice (DGL), high quality digestive enzymes, raw apple cider vinegar (ACV) and small amounts of baking soda 45 minutes after my meals. I am also waiting for D-Limonene to come in the mail, read cool things about how it can line and protect the esophagus… I presume the whopping challenge for me will be the diet adjustment… I have not eaten well consistently for a long time and I LOVE wine and beer! UGH. Just started my little protocol today but will report back now and again. Good luck and cheers to your health advancements!"
4,shelly808,134,"Hello, Throat is not good… YES to every single question. I also have this thin mucous that constantly is in my throat I feel the need to bring up and spit out. Nastiness! Stomach gas that is often difficult to burp up, and energy levels ok but I OFTEN get really tired after eating. So check it out, Candida MAY be a component for what we have going…actually just one of the symptoms. I found this guy on YOUTUBE and he had the absolute best explanation regarding GERD I have ever heard. He has been very helpful and shares his knowledge. Ever heard of SIBO?

6,vadimo,134,"Hi Shelly, I would really not take more antibiotics unless you were diagnosed scientifically with what ever you think you may have. Candida is not a bacteria, it is a fungus and does not get killed by anti-biotics which is why taking antibiotics actually makes the issue worst. I don’t believe anyone has the full answer but the candida overgrowth theory is definitely a very plausible and logical one in my opinion. I strongly believe I made my case worst by taking too many antibiotics. Stress and general mood/emotional well being is also a big factor. Do you remember what you were going through emotionally during the very first onset of your symptoms and then when they became what they are today? Best, V"
7,shelly808,134,"Hello Vadimo, Thanks for your insights… I have not taken more anti-biotics. I am beginning to believe that possibly candida is the cause of all of my symptoms. I drink too much and eat way too much sugar. I have had some serious rounds of antibiotics. Just learned about the morning spit test, gonna do that tomorrow morning. I just bought a product called candex but I know I have to change my diet. ugh."
8,vadimo,134,"Hi Shelly, How did the spit test go? I have just seen a Functional Doctor in London, Dr. George Mouton who told me that as a guideline, for now, until his tests reveal what I have, I should stick to not having more than 25grammes of fructose a day, which is what I am trying to do, failing on a few days though… He said I most likely have candida overgrowth but that a change in diet alone will not do it, that the underlying issue was a weakened immune system which is what allowed me to have the candida overgrowth in the first place and that for now we needed to contain it whilst we await the blood and urine test results. I am curious to see what the results are… On another note, I am now in Brazil, going to see Joao de Deus in a few days, that should be interesting too! Speak soon and let me know how things are going for you Shelly. best, V"
0,bikerbabe,135,"Just wanted to say hi and I can’t believe it has taken me so long to find you! Looks like a lovely supportive group from what I’ve read so far 🙂 I am 38 yrs old with a nearly 2 yr old little one to look after. I was first diagnosed with candida 15 years ago by a homeopathic doctor after months of going to my GP and being told its a virus/it’s all in your head/etc. (I was a classic antibiotic/contraceptive pill popping candidate). It was such a relief to have a diagnosis. I got prescribed amphotericin and the sugar/yeast free diet and it was a miracle to quickly have my life back. I haven’t eaten sugar since then, but I became vegetarian about a yr later due to my new boyfriend at the time (very important to him). Over the years I have felt a bit ‘fungal’ now and then, so I would stop eating bread and take citricidal for a few days and would be OK. BUT… I don’t think it has ever properly gone away. I never put the pieces together until this year, but I suddenly developed excema about 5 years ago after cleaning mold off a wall and I have had more and more instances of breathlessness (asthma symptoms) over the years which I put down to being a smoker and being unfit. Anyway…. It all came to a head in March this year when I ended up in hospital with a full blown asthma attack… Very scary. I had every blood test under the sun and surprise surprise the doc says I am fine… I have cut out gluten and dairy for months now and initally my chest cleared amazingly, so I know I have multiple food intolerances/allergies, presumably caused by leaky gut which is caused by the candida!!!!! ARGH!!! Starting a mission now to sort this out once and for all as I am SICK of feeling like SHIT all the time! I have a little girl who needs a healthy mama. Sorry that was so long. Just wanted to introduce myself."

A few months ago I was invited along to see a lady who practises Energy Medicine.

I guess what I am trying to figure out is what I need to do to get well as its is definitly more complex than physically getting rid of the yeast!"

0,tude58,136,"First of all thank you for this forum! Each time I feel like giving up I read others going through the same thing and while the info can be overwhelming none of it seems as overwhelming as this journey has been. I cleaned up my aunts house in 2009. She’s an extreme hoarder and of course MOLD. I’ve been a truck driver for years in the agricultural field. Never miss work, long hours (seasonal) and very physically demanding. When the symptoms first hit they were nueropathy and paranthesia along with a bizarre thing: I coulndt hold my neck up. This passed after a couple weeks and I went back to driving. By the end of 2010 I had to shut down my truck. The pain from nerves, fog, dizziness and all was so bad I couldnt feel safe driving. I’ve not been able to work since this time with the exception of caring for family members who were on home health, hospice etc. My husband and I bought a home that was infested with mold. Up to this point I still had no idea what was causing me to be so sick, exhausted, dizzy and truly thought i was dying. In 2012 I met an ENT who specialized in mold. He put me on diflucan, amphetericin B and gentomycin along with clyndamycin nasal spray. It hit my liver too hard yet in time I felt better until re-exosed and too much anti-biotics for sinusitis. I’ve been on pain meds (low dose 3 times per day) which do help some with the intensity of the nerve pain but have been cutting them back due to the fact they’re bad for me but frankly at the time had I not had them I gave up on living the pain was so bad. I finally got in to see a naturopath in candida, mold, you name it and he has me on tons of little bottles of tonic. We are tearing down the candida and then re-building my immune system. I try not to be scared about all this. It’s been going on for so long. Your stories encourage me and just when I was about to throw in the towel I saw a post from raster about the baths. They really do help! I worry about finances as all this is expensive and we are used to having two incomes. My husband is trying to be understanding but this is alot to bite off so my work is keeping my stress level down and trying to function at least part of the day. Good days (sort of) bad days and horrible days with ups and downs between them all. I feel for everyone here. If I could change anything it would be the length of time it takes to feel better and get to work. Blessings, Terri"

Beginning to suspect candida, based mostly on not being able to heal my rashes, l have been using a lot of the components of your protocol, out of order of course, for the last month.  I was eating a pretty clean Paleo/Whole30 diet (working on Food Allergies/Leaky Gut) but not nearly as restrictive as the strict diet you recommend. My three rashes have been flaring up, my hypo thyroid has been flipping between hypo and hyper symptoms and I have very low energy. In the past month I’ve added: – Restore a Fulvic Acid Supplement 1 Teaspoon 1 x per day and spraying on rashes 1-2x a day- my holistic MD believes that Fulvic, Asea, Earthing, Exercise and a Vegan Diet will cure anything. -Thorne Molybdenum Picolinate 1 mg (not the Amino Acid Chelated form) 1 x a day -Nature’s Way Thisilyn 175 mg Milk Thistle Extract seed, (80% silymarin 2 x a day -MegaFlora probiotic 1 x per day -inner eco Coconut Kefir 1 Tea 1 x a day -Coptis aka Goldthread Chinese Herb Tincture 3 droppers full a day suggested by my chiropractor- I read that this contains the Berberine that you mention to hold off on. Took only one dose and it seemed to make my heart palpitations worse so I stopped but Chrio suggested I try it as a mouth swish since I blame part of my low immune system on 5 root canals. -NutraMedix Adrenal Support Herbal Tincture 5 drops 1 x a day (Schizandra berry, Astragalus root Rhododendron caucasicum root, Ginseng & Rhodiola Roots)  BTW I ‘air’ any tinctures for 15- 20 min in 105 degree warm water to hopefully remove the alcohol -Kraut Juices and fermented veggies from Farmstead Ferments. – Pau D’arco Tea Regarding Vitamin C: In the past taking Vitamin C has resulted in bowel bleeding similar to how Aspirin or NSAIDs affect me so I’ve only taken ¼ Teaspoon (125 mg) Vitamin C (Nature’s Way Alive!) maybe once a week in my breakfast smoothie and the 7 mg of Vit C in MegaFlora probiotic daily. BTW my breakfast smoothie the past 6 months has included 1/3 of a capsule of Turmeric, several shakes of Cinnamon, ¼ tea of the Vit C, Hemp powder, Chia Seeds, almond milk (homemade from soaked raw organic almonds, organic vanilla, 1 Medjool date) and or unsweetened coconut milk , shredded coconut, tiny amounts of VitaMineral Green, Schulze Superfood, Amazing Meal (not when doing stints of NO Grains), Olive oil or Coconut oil or coconut butter or avocado, organic Berries, frozen banana, ice and sometimes raw pastured eggs (from hens eating bugs and non-GMO grains). •	With my sensitivity to Vitamin C should I try it and at what dose or is there anything else to take instead? •	Since I had been tinkering with all of these is there anything I need to do to balance out before I start the protocol?  •	Is there any recommended way to eat while I collect the supplements and prepare for doing the protocol? I have also been curious about these protocols and theories:  Robert von Sarbacher’s Mini Beet Protocol THE BIAMONTE METHOD: OF CANDIDA ELIMINATION (cannot afford to test or council w/ him)  and about Naturopath John Matsen’s theories on digestion  Web Site: http://www.eatingalive.com/ Andrea Beaman wrote: http://www.andreabeaman.com/health/the-curse-of-candida/#.UkSufoYm2TM “Finally, after many months of misery I found the missing piece. I read a book called, Eating Alive, by naturopathic doctor, John Matsen. According to his book, candida can escape and wreak havoc in our system from eating too many foods rich in potassium (vegetables and fruits), without adequate protein (animal products) and salt, causing the ileocecal valve to weaken, allowing yeast to migrate from the large intestine to the small intestine, and other parts of the body. That’s why I felt worse the “healthier” I ate. It made perfect sense. My candida overgrowth never really healed because it wasn’t enough to simply eliminate the food candida thrived on (carbohydrates, fruit, starchy vegetables, sweets) I had to simultaneously strengthen my ileocecal valve.” •	Do you know if these been discussed on the Candida Forums? I am now in a process of researching, discovery, counting the cost, deciding about the supplements, preparing my conviction and how to work with my husband who eats more of a SAD diet. I’ve wanted to use food and herbs more and supplement less and most important to me is to trust in the Lord to lead me to learn what I need to learn to heal and to help others. I am most appreciative of all you have shared it is overwhelming kindness, giving and attention to details that matter. Thank you! Martha Ray Percyfaith"
1,Able900,137,"I have heard that there is a urine test to do for Candida. Do you recommend getting a definitive diagnosis and is the testing reliable? Neither a stool test nor a urine test will tell you for certain whether or not you have a Candida overgrowth. The Genomma Lab offers a dependable test. You can contact them online at http://genommalab.com/en/inicio.aspx I’m afraid I can’t help you any further with test information as I never sought to be tested during my own treatment. Frankly, I’m not sure why you want to be tested. You mentioned the symptoms of rashes, food allergies from leaky gut syndrome, a low immune system, heart palpitations, and hypothyroidism, all of which are symptoms of a Candida infestation.With my sensitivity to Vitamin C should I try it and at what dose or is there anything else to take instead? You really do need to be taking some form of vitamin C. You might try a buffered form starting with a low amount and gradually work your way up to a higher dose.I have also been curious about these protocols and theories: Do you know if these been discussed on the Candida Forums? I really have no idea; you could try keying one protocol or theory at a time into the search option on the forum.In the past month I’ve added: – Restore a Fulvic Acid Supplement 1 Teaspoon 1 x per day and spraying on rashes 1-2x a day- my holistic MD believes that Fulvic, Asea, Earthing, Exercise and a Vegan Diet will cure anything. -Thorne Molybdenum Picolinate 1 mg (not the Amino Acid Chelated form) 1 x a day -Nature’s Way Thisilyn 175 mg Milk Thistle Extract seed, (80% silymarin 2 x a day -MegaFlora probiotic 1 x per day -inner eco Coconut Kefir 1 Tea 1 x a day -Coptis aka Goldthread Chinese Herb Tincture 3 droppers full a day suggested by my chiropractor- I read that this contains the Berberine that you mention to hold off on.

I’m afraid I’ve never even heard of some of the supplements you’ve named.

2,raster,137,"Here is a fact for you: we all have candida we just all don’t have pathogenic candida in high levels. So the tests can be inconclusive because the yeast can live in specific organs which won’t necessarily show up on stool tests, and because we all have yeast in our bodies…so it may have been in the non-pathogenic form when you did the testing. Did you do any of the metametrix tests? http://www.candidaplan.com/store/Candida-Testing/ There is a possibility you have something else such as parasites, microbial, or bacterial overgrowth. What caused your allergies and leaky gut? I don’t think we can say which of your supplements are best but the molybdenum recommended on the forum has to be the amino chelate form for it to be effective Berberine is basically like taking anti-biotics so I would be wary of taking this product. The alcohol in the tinctures won’t feed the candida and will barely set you back, if at all. Additionally, the alcohol preserves the stuff in the tinctures…so this will make them ineffective over the long term. If you have rectal bleeding you could have hemorrhoids and these are not worth worrying about. I would get positive diagnosis. Other types of bleeding can be dangerous and I would get it checked out. -raster"

I also have/had 7 root canals- 2 back ones have been pulled. I also have Hypothyroidism, Insulin resistance and high Inflammation (C-RP marker) Despite all those I was never out sick with colds or flu or digestive issue. Except for mild joint pains which went away when I lost weight and got off coffee I felt healthy. Rashes have come and gone since I did a stint of Vegan in ’06, they have been worse over the last year and have my attention now. Not working right now so I can concentrate on my health. -I’ve ordered the correct Moly amino chelate form. -I will be careful with the Coptis. My Chiropractor is big on Coptis, a berberine, for me from strength testing he did– I am now swishing in my mouth now instead of swallowing. I keep it 2 hours away from my probiotic. Target is to work on my root canal teeth since there may be infection under the crowns affecting my immune system. I am to hopefully see a Hal Huggins trainer/dentist in Jan of 2014. – About the alcohol in the tinctures I only ‘air’ out the drops I take, not the whole bottle…I know it has to stay preserved. I ‘air out’ tincture drops in about 15 min in shot glass of 100-105 degree water provided the herbal can take that- not always easy to find out. Alcohol in tinctures has always bothered my system. – the rectal bleeding is complicated and even longer to explain– but it is being watched by my MD – I am long winded.. Thank you so much for all your thoughts. Most appreciated."
0,DaughterNature,138,"So it’s been about 4 months (16 weeks) for me on this diet. I started out completely and utterly desperate, having suffered from Candida for more than 3 years after taking birth control and antibiotics. I felt like I was dying. I couldn’t digest ANYTHING without it coming out looking the way it did going in. I was in the bathroom for about 7 hours each day and my family thought I was insane with my diet. I have eaten rutabaga, brussels sprouts, eggs, coconut oil, hemp oil, oat bran, bell peppers, onions, and cucumbers as my daily source of food. After about 2 months I started to feel human again. After about 3 months I started to feel normal. Now, I NEVER experience hunger, bloating, gas, or any side effects. I have heard of one or two success stories but didn’t believe it would happen to me because I was just miserable for so long. I am a first year teacher and without this strict regimen I probably would have had to quit my job because of not being able to stay out of the bathroom. I started at the right time. Seriously, my fiancé and his family can’t believe how I’ve changed. I initially lost 10 pounds (weighing in at 106 lbs) but I gained it all back and with exercise I am currently at 112 lbs. My stomach is always flat now–not like I am pregnant like it was before. -I drink 1 and 1/2 cups of raw milk kefir morning and night. IT WAS MY SAVIOR. SERIOUSLY… at first I was allergic to kefir (like everything else it made my bloat for an hour before I sat on the toilet for another hour and pooped out undigested kefir grains… YUCK) Now I have no problem. -I stopped taking the HCL and only take the Swedish Bitters to aid in digestion.  -Lots of water and nettle leaf tea -I also take a myriad of supplements (I have not been able to get commercial probiotics yet but plan to do so very soon) I have spent about $300 on this diet in pills and necessities. I have saved about $600 in the last 4 months in food costs and over-the-counter meds because all i eat are healthy fresh products that I get locally from free-range providers. I have saved MUCH more in doctor costs because doctors wanted to prescribe me antibiotics and other medications for problems unrelated to Candida. My advice: patience!! and if you’re anything like I was, QUIT COMPLAINING! 🙂 SMALL MEALS, light exercise, and kefir are the keys to fewer digestive problems. I will update later once I’ve introduced beans. I will wait two months at least because I remember how terrible I was at digesting beans… Message me if you want to know more. DaughterNature"
0,bouncygal,139,"So a week ago i thought i was over the hump, i started to feel amazing it lasted a week, and now im back to feeling like shit again. iv been on this (lisa richards diet) for 4months. I’m starting to feel guilty about all the lying about im doing, even though i know i shouldn’t. I feel like a lazy person especially after i had my week of feeling great, i realised how much i havent been doing. My boyfriend and housemate do there thing while i just sit around like a fat house cat napping eating and sleeping… its annoying that i can’t feel comfortable with the proccess, i don’t feel understood so i feel judged for my actions or lack there of. I don’t know how i can take much more of this, and yet i don’t see another option but to push on. Lifes not ment to be a bitch, i really don’t believe it is, yet right now its a real effort to stay positive…..guess i got to remember the starving and diseased people in 3rd world countries who don’t have a choice hard road or not. Yep today i feel angry and frustrated. bouncy"
0,HeatherJ,140,"The good news: almost every menu had grilled vegetables and salads. Ordering grilled meat was no problem and EVER waiter was sympathetic with my diet constraints. One waiter brought me a dish that, it ended up, I couldn’t eat. He quickly brought me a new plate with deep apologies. Yes, I left him a big tip. The bad news: gelato. All and all, sticking to the diet was possible. Eggs were available at breakfast and vegetables were available everywhere. The most common condiment was olive oil…so, totally yummy. But we walked a lot and having enough energy was difficult. On the last day I ate one small pancake because I needed the carbohydrates. After three days of walking five miles a day, a long day of flying back without food until I got home, that one little pancake felt imperative. I’m sure it was all in my head…but the GREAT news is that I didn’t have a reaction. And I couldn’t resist two small bites of gelato-Rum Raisin one day and coconut/chocolate another. It was hot, I was hungry and my husband wouldn’t stop saying how good it was. I’m only human. But the real lifesaver were the little grocer wagons we found on so many street corners. They sold fresh, watered, coconut slices. They were a lot to chew, but very filling-and guilt free. Three months ago it took me half an hour to get out of bed because my joints hurt. I was 25 lbs heavier and felt awful. While I am not back to 100%, the progress is undeniable. And for the first time in 5 years, I was happy to pose for pictures. The only problem was constipation-I get it whenever I fly. I went 4 days without a BM…does that mean that Candida multiplied? I’m thinking I would be wise to go back to Phase 1 for 5 days…thoughts?"

0,alexalgebra,141,"Hey y’all… it’s been 9 months on the diet for me. I have, unfortunately, not been doing very well. I had a pretty crazy summer, as you might have read, and kind of overdid it and crashed pretty hard a couple of weeks after I got home. I also tried to test out tomatoes again, and I think that sealed the deal. I feel like I did about 8 months ago and have for the past month or so. It’s a pretty big bummer that all of my work went to waste because of me being careless. I guess I just want this to be a lesson to y’all…don’t cheat, don’t add foods too fast, don’t overdo it with your body, and get your rest!! I’m back on track, cut out all of the foods I had added in, and am doubling the amount of kefir I was drinking, but nothing much is really helping even though it’s been a month. I’m feeling pretty hopeless right now, but maybe someday I’ll feel better again. I’m glad y’all are here."

As I feel better and better, I start to question whether I was really all that sick before and I start pushing myself physically because there’s so much to be done. Yesterday I was as active as I’ve been in seven months with house work and home repair projects and biking to town with my daughter and two hours of physical volunteer work there and home for yard work and cooking until I was frightened to feel that old exhaustion suddenly reappear. I was as exhausted as I’ve been in many weeks. It reminded me that I am not all better and I was quite sick and I will take it much easier from here on out.  Sorry you have crashed so hard. I have to think you’ll bounce back faster than you did in the first go round. Rest and take care! Sue"
6,alexalgebra,141,"Thanks y’all! I’m doing a little better today…two days ago, I did a lot of meditating and woo-woo hippie talking with my spirit guides. I’m trying to get back in a better mindset. I got a part in my dream musical (I play a genderqueer unicorn with a magical dance sequence!), so I’m trying to rest up as much as I can before rehearsals start for that. It’s a pretty casual show – tiny production company, new playwright – so I think it will be as mellow as a production can be. I haven’t seen the script yet, but I’m kind of hoping my part isn’t too big, LOL! I also did a dance class yesterday that kind of kicked my ass, but I felt really good for awhile after…until last night, when I had some random bladder pains that came out of nowhere. Luckily, they only lasted about 45 minutes. Usually, I only get them when I accidentally eat too much sugar, but yesterday I didn’t have anything that would even be close to questionable :/ I’m just going to keep praying for a miracle and eating my greens :/"
0,bouncygal,142,"I’m 24 and i started in winter which is when the body slows down and the worst time to start, but thats when it happened for me. I finally decided to tackle this demon i knew iv had for a few years now. I fooled myself into believing i was comfortable with my life, with the carefree candida life, and yet i wasn’t because deep down inside i knew i had it and i cared about that very much. My sex drive really decreased, my brain was a fuzz, i couldn’t deal with life it was all so scatted. The Candida diet was so much more than just a change of what i ate. I became even more tired, i got sick, i got itchy i began to feel… die off. Though the struggle i have started developing new found mental strength to get though these times. Also gaining self discipline in order to keep drinking all the water, exercising, taking the supplements ect. I rekindled my determination and despite falling on my face a few times with smoking i keep on fighting. I also started to listen to my body like i never did before, i respect the pains more now and realized the body talks too. Oh and lastly i learned to socialize without relying on booze. Its so much better to face the shit than pile it under the carpet where it can fester into much worse. I’m still not completely healed, not sure how long iv got but i’m exercising true will. The will to heal, i’m no longer on automatic i’m on manual or dare i say rewriting it. Thank-you to everyone on this forum who shares there words of wisdom, it is an invaluable part of my progress. xxx Bouncy"

6,alexalgebra,142,"Congrats on the improvements – you are on the way! Definitely just keep sticking with the plan and the results will keep coming 🙂 On the note about socializing without booze – I have been sober for going on 7 years, and honestly, the hardest part about going through that whole process was not stopping drinking, but re-learning how to interact. I went through 12-step recovery for a couple of addictions (alcohol goes hand in hand with another of mine), so I basically had to switch, as they say in AA, my “people, places, and playthings” and start hanging out with folks that didn’t just party all the time. It took me about a year to really learn how to talk to people and feel okay at bars without a drink in my hand (to this day, I still have to carry around a glass of water or I feel really itchy), but I found that the more time I spent sober around drunk folks, the more I really didn’t miss it that much, and the more I valued time spent with friends doing things outside of bars and parties. Obviously, I’m an alcoholic/addict so I probably drink a little differently than y’all, but regardless, it was a nice change of pace once I got through the growing pains of it."

3,raster,143,"If you aren’t feeling well there could be a few reasons. One is you are consuming foods that benefit the yeast such as rice, corn, carrots, beets, fruits, etc. then you will feel sluggish in general and won’t make much progress. Another part of it is you might not be eating the right foods that give you energy…think smoothies. If you were to drink a kale, broccoli, brazil nut, and prune smoothie (with other stuff) this likely would give you a lot of energy and make you feel good. Smoothies also aid in your digestion. The other is you may not be eating enough food. Be sure to eat big meals where you are stuffed like thanksgiving and snack between meals on things like celery. Additionally, you might have blood sugar problems and may need some more natural sugar. Eating some veggies, fruit, or carbs is a good way to increase your energy. Exercise is needed in life. A way to boost your long term energy is to do some light exercises such as walking or swimming. I can give more suggestions. There are supplements that increase your energy too. Most people on here have drained adrenals so you need plenty of rest and time for these to replenish. -raster"
4,alexalgebra,143,"I would also be careful on things like brazil nuts and prunes (you don’t really want to be eating nuts and fruit at this point), and too much raw food can be hard on your digestion. (I know this is directly contradicting what raster says – sorry raster, definitely don’t agree with you there!) I would also opt for eating a lot of smaller meals instead of stuffing yourself at meals. That definitely makes me feel sluggish and terrible, and exacerbates all of my candida symptoms. Feel free to message me if you have questions – I’ve been at this for about 9 months and I’m going through some struggles right now after a busy, crazy summer, but I was doing well until I blew myself out and tested foods too soon, LOL :p"

0,shayfo,144,"Today marks eight months since I started treatment for my candida overgrowth. If you want background on my story or to see the progression of my treatment, read my seven-month update, six-month update, five-month update, and four-month update. Not to be a jerk and make all you brain-foggy folks out there read, but repeating myself is boring, and reading my updates is generally not :p So, I fucked up this month. Reintroducing foods is sort of a slippery slope, and I kind of fell on my ass. Although I didn’t mention it in my seven-month update, since I didn’t want to be a bad influence on people chomping at the bit to reintroduce fruit, I had eaten really tiny amounts of fruit. We have a goji berry tree at my house, so I would eat 5-10 goji berries a few days a week. I also ate a few blackberries from our blackberry bush, but literally only one or two in a week. We have nectarine and peach trees that grow the tiniest fruit ever (total volume equals about 3-4 tablespoons per fruit), and I ate three or four of those over the course of a month. I really think eating those fruits in that quantity was totally fine. But then I got really busy about a month ago, and two things happened: I got reeeeally burnt out on cooking, and I started making excuses about making bad decisions. I started eating fruit a little more often, though still in pretty small quantities and only three or four days a week. I ate carrots a few days a week. I ate way way way too much goddamn almond butter, because it’s so convenient and tastes good on celery, which is one of the only vegetables I can eat raw (not because of candida/digestion issues, but because raw crucifers are bad for my sad sad thyroid), and raw vegetables are incredibly seductive when I don’t want to cook. I ate sunflower seeds from 7-11 a couple times, which are coated in shitty oils (cottonseed and/or safflower and/or peanut). I ate way fewer vegetables because I didn’t want to cook them. I would go to work or to bed hungry because I couldn’t talk myself into cooking. I also drank zero-calorie soda a bunch of times, which is probably the only thing more disgusting than regular soda :p This went on for about three weeks. None of these decisions sound THAT bad on their own, really, but with their powers combined, I’ve noticed that I have a small amount of tinea versicolor again (ugh!). My digestion is a little weird right now, but it’s hard to tell what’s related to my lazy eating and what’s related to being on my period (which my uterus takes as an opportunity to bully my digestive system for a week). Pretty great. My energy levels are slightly less than optimal, though in all fairness, I AM a lot busier right now than I have been my entire treatment. Oddly enough, my thrush has cleared up completely (go figure). Another dumb thing I did: I started testing pecans this past Sunday morning, and put a tablespoon or two in my hot cereal. Like a dummy, I ate half a fig later that morning at my friend’s garden, totally not thinking about how I’d just tried a new food an hour or two earlier. I’m not sure which of those things made me sick later, but one of them sure did. At this point, I’m going to wait until my tinea versicolor goes away (again) before I try anything else at all. It’s frustrating to waste time like this because of careless decisions, but at least they’re learning moments, right? :p To not be a total downer, some good things happened this month, too, primarily that I made it through three consecutive weekends of birthday parties without drinking and without getting weird and sad (including my own birthday party). The worst thing I did on my birthday was drink a 4-oz hemp milk latte (which was goddamn deliiiiiicious). I still feel 90% (92% ?) better than I did when I started my treatment…just not, you know, 99%, which is where I would have rated myself a month ago. Technical stuff: -VCO everyday -brussels sprouts 6 days a week and rutabagas 4 times a month (over it) -200bil CFU probiotics everyday -goat milk kefir 5-6 days a week Let me be your cautionary tale! The customary list of things I’ve learned: -three weeks of not doing anything “toooo” bad can still set you back -that I sometimes turn a blind eye to my own bad decisions (the same mechanism that allowed me to feed my candida so well for so many years even when I knew something was wrong and encourages a bunch of other bad behavior…something to meditate on in general, for sure) -this is really hard to do while really busy 🙁 all of you who are working full time and have kids and whatever and are STILL doing this are fucking champions, seriously -I’m still not as good at moderation as I’d like to be, bleh -I have a peanut intolerance, suspected a month or two again and confirmed by peanut oil-containing sunflower seeds making me break out like crazy -eight months seems to be approximately how long it takes for most people to come around to supporting and accepting and respecting this way of existing…finally :p Sorry to be so grim, but if you can learn through my mistakes instead of your own, maybe you can save yourself some time and anguish. Here’s hoping?"
1,msmofish,144,"Shayfo  Happy (belated) Birthday !! Thanks so much for your updates, they help tremendously & put it all in perspective. I personally really appreciate them as they help me keep going. I’m at the 3 month mark thank you for the hope & inspiration best MO"
2,Able900,144," Congratulations, Fruitbutt. No kidding and seriously, great job even with the fruit screw-up.But then I got really busy about a month ago, and two things happened: I got reeeeally burnt out on cooking, and I started making excuses about making bad decisions. I started eating fruit a little more often. You know the problem with fruit? It’s just too damn convenient. It’s the fruit’s fault, certainly not yours.rutabagas 4 times a month (over it) Not hard to do. Seems like lessons equal knowledge, no matter how bad they hurt. Dammit. Way to go, kiddo. Sean"
3,SueSullivan,144,"Shay, thanks for taking the time to keep updating us. It is so helpful to read how the battle is going for people further down the timeline. Glad you’re still feeling 91 percent better, despite the setbacks — at least they don’t knock you back very far anymore."
4,bouncygal,144,Love your story. Congrats for getting so far <3
5,stovariste,144,"thanks for update. Thanks for sharing experience, mistakes, know-how, etc etc… I myself also tested some food, I found that small dosages wont affect me too much (stealing handful of French fries, two-three spoonful of brown-rice, and even one slice of rye bread, but taking it too much almost killed me 🙂"
6,shayfo,144,"Thanks for all the supportive/semi-supportive (coughABLEcough) responses 🙂 I’m currently just waiting for summer/birthday season to be over so I can stop thinking about how much I want to goddamn drink these days :p I was fine for seven months, and lately I just reeeeally really really reeeeeeeeally want to drink. Ugh."
7,barnmouse,144,"Hey Shayfo, great to read your update. And happy belated birthday! I’m sure many of us have messed up, whether intentionally or accidentally. Feeling 90-92% better in a relatively short time is a great accomplishment. Good for you! You’re right, this is really hard to do when you’re so busy (or just plain lazy!). Do you know how many times I’ve just wanted to grab a tub of hummus and go at it with a bag of baby carrots or pita bread? And I’m so jealous that you have all that fruit right in your yard. Not that I’d be able to eat any of it right now. It’s torturous enough having all that summer fruit in the produce department taunting me. Damn fruit! :p"

Let me see if I can help you out a bit here, Lady Shay, with a little semiCOUGHsupport. Every time you have that thought of drinking, picture all the little Candida devils swimming and partying in that alcohol. See the smiles and laughter on their cute little faces? Their happy faces represent the enjoyment they’re getting from that alcohol, and we won’t even mention the other thing it’s helping them with. Hint: think reproduction. Get your crayons out and color that image. The water is a nice blue and you can color the little creatures that are dirtying the pretty water black.  Glad to help. 😉"
10,shayfo,144,I actually usually picture them as out-of-control Bukowski-esque drunks who stumble around breaking shit and projectile-vomiting and shouting at each other and the gods.
11,msmofish,144,!! HAHAAHAAAHAAA !! This is one of the very best posts !! thanks for the laughs !
0,kevlab,145,"Hi, I’m joining the forum to share my story as it evolves, and to hopefully stay on track this time with the support of the vast amount of experiences and advice shared here. I also hope that my story will be of use to someone else transitioning into a new way of being. My new diet starts as soon as I can work out my budget! Thank you in advance to everyone who offers support. Here’s some background on my situation for anyone interested:  I had been feeling very ill for some time, due to a combination of poor diet, lack of exercise and possibly mold infestation in my previous residence. More contributing factors may have been dramatically increased alcohol consumption and stress. My stomach was painfully bloated, and I had to buy too-large pants to try and relieve pressure pains I was having. I hit a point where for an entire week I wasn’t able to go #2 (that’s poo for all you lamen). I was so bloated and in a good amount of pain that was getting worse that week until I vomitted up what looked like digested food (dirreah) and a bunch of weird, white, spikey ball shaped chunks. That was enough to take myself to emerge, where they said I was “pristine” and I should just go home and drink fluids. (long story sorry). So I went to a Naturopath that put me on a diet: no dairy, grains (except quinoa), sugar, eggs, along with restricting other known Candida triggers from my diet. I accompanied that with 5 session of colon hydrotherapy, Anti fungals and digestive enzymes. The cravings were hard at first, but I started to see and feel a good improvement. My stomach felt like it was healing, A headache I didn’t realize I had started to go away and I was finding that a new source of energy I wasn’t aware of before was coming back to me and I was feeling stronger every day. By the second week, I was very energetic and people started to notice a big change in me. I honestly think some people thought I might have been using recreational drugs due to how fast my state was changing. I was feeling great and telling everybody about my success. Unfortunately this was not the only thing I was doing for my health at the time, and I started feeling like maybe the diet wasn’t the only thing making me feel better. At about my third week, I told myself, “a burger wouldn’t hurt”, and that began the downward upward yoyo spiral back to my old diet habits. I can say now, It’s been a year since then, and I want to get back onto the Candida diet and conquer my symptons this time around!"
1,kevlab,145,"I just wanted to post an update. I tried search for a good candida diet plan and I found the Candida diet created by Dr. McComb (website here http://www.candidaplan.com/). It comes complete with a pre-planned first week, shopping list and supporting activities to do, so I’ll try it and see how I feel. Right now I’m feeling tired, sore and dehydrated. I’m not sleeping that well, but I have been keeping moderately active for someone that works a desk job."
2,kevlab,145,"Alright well today was supposed to be my day one, but I slipped up with my diet. I remember the first time around I found it a lot easier to do an elimination diet. For some reason this time I give into cravings as soon as I have them. It’s 2pm now, and here’s what I ate: a Vega One with water first this in the morning coconut water, whey protien another Vega one scoop Then someone shouted free pizza and without even considering I had two pieces. I went out after for Soba Beef noodles. I thought the soba was buckwheat so it’d be OK, but after looking it up they have white flour in them… I feel hopeless. I’m going to hit up the recipes section and see if I can get over my cravings. Why is it so hard this time? It might have to do with the fact that I’ve been exercising more, which probably means I need more food.. If I don’t eat, all I know is that it makes me really really cranky and unconfortable."
0,bouncygal,146,"I just walked up the street and back 30min total to get some avocado,rutabaga & exercise. My boyfriend came with me. I’m finding walking a stuggle, hard to carry the 2 avocados and rutabaga in my bag, then theres my boyfriend telling me to hurry up as he walks at a considerably fast pace in front of me. Wish he could understand, i don’t want sympathy as such i just want him to know why im slower and that im doing my best or better yet walk beside me. I asked him how would he treat me if i had cancer and he replyed along the lines of that being a legitamate reason. Its sucks in moments like these, i felt better when i was eating sugar,smoking and drinking….. Bouncy"
1,shayfo,146,"Man, I totally understand. The first couple of months are really hard. I had a lot of friends saying things like, “Oh, you quit sugar? S do you feel awesome now?” And I’d have to sort of just be like “No…no. I don’t. At all,” and then still defend my decision. It sucks, but it eventually gets better. Hang in there!"
2,bouncygal,146,🙂 thanks for the reply
3,SueSullivan,146,"The breathlessness and lack of energy does suck, but it sounds like the boyfriend’s lack of empathy is the bigger disheartening event. Some boyfriends are more empathetic than others. Some boyfriends have other positive qualities that balance out a less-than-satisfactory ability to empathize. It’s good to notice what matters to you and how important it is relative to other qualities. Empathetic abilities can grow with age (but no guarantees.) As the saying goes, “it’s none of my business what other people think of me.” It’s much easier to apply this to the store clerk who is dismissive of you or the co-worker gossiping about you than your boyfriend, husband, or parents but it really is just as true. It’s our job to be super empathetic and supportive of ourselves, and not anyone else’s. It’s an awesome bonus if those around us can give us that as well, but not required. If you notice yourself wanting someone else to understand and be supportive of yourself, the best thing you can do is be very gentle and supportive of yourself and give them the space to be who they are, right now. for what it’s worth, sue p.s. sorry you’re not feeling better right now. you will!"
4,bouncygal,146,"Some good points there Sue, thanks for replying"
5,HeatherJ,146,"I hope you are feeling better today. It is so easy to forget how crappy you felt before-the aches and pains, the bloating-whatever your issues were. Try to remember your gains. LIke for me, I have been slowly gaining weight, while eating absolutely nothing, over the past few years. So far, I have lost 18 pounds. Putting on pants that used to not fit is a moment of clarity for me; I know I am regaining my health because my body is returning to normal. Whatever your gains are, let those be the light that guide you. With regard to your boyfriend, I have heard this a couple of times lately, “When people tell you who they are, believe them.” But good for you for not giving in! Your commitment to your health is what will get you through this. I hope you are allowing yourself down-time…for example, at 8:30, I clock-out. I’m in bed watching a movie or reading a book. Knowing that I have this time at the end of the day makes the moments of struggle easier to get through. Good luck! All of that said, I don’t know what lengths I would go to for one (big) piece of chocolate cake that wouldn’t do me in! LOL!!!"
6,subtlesoul,146,"Hi, I had been struggling for 1.5 years before i realised it might be candida. but big chenge in last couple of weeks.  I had a very bad case where it had spread through and i was having tingling in my ears super stiff neck, shoulder, joint pains abdominal pain bloating etc. These are some of the things that worked for me. (Please understand these things may vary with people so if it does not work for yuo discontinue. i tried lot of things before i set myself on these things below) Within 2 weeks i have already loosened my diat and i started Gymming gain. General things (everyone talkes about these): 1) Cut out on breads and anything with yeast in it. Cooked Quinoa with yoghurt salt and spices worked for me. 2) Yoghurt(low sugar) – make sure it contains lot of probiotics (this willyou dont lose much energy) 3) Deep breathing(preferaby alone, concentrating on the breath, at least half hour) 4) Fasting  *Try to eat very less at night/before you go to sleep *Once a week or once in two weeks try to reduce your food intake (while keeping your activities down for the day)  5) Streachig and excercises 6) Lots of water (preferably warm) Highlight: #1 Oil of oregano and raw garlic clove intake helped a bit(in conjunction with probiotic(yoghurt in my case) But what helped most was when i took the oil of oregano and applied it generously on my skin(especially neck back and abdomen). I had mild burning sensation in exact spots of pain for 15 minutes and then magically the pain dissapeared. Within 2 weeks i have already loosened my diat and i started Gymming gain. #2 This again is a personal opinion. But conserving sexual energy would be good too. Yeast flourishes in a estrogenic environment. So keeping estrogen levels in check and yuo will see you feel better. #3 MOST IMPORTANT. LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. Watch out for responses and adapt your lifestyle accordingly I know this period sucks.. but HANG IN THERE.. once you are out of this yuo will really learn to appriciate the gift of health. lots of smiles and love to all 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 🙂 God bless all!"

0,cat,147,"Hello everyone- I have learned SO MUCH from the wealth of knowledge here on the Forum and wanted to thank everyone who has contributed to this amazingly helpful resource! To Able & Raster (and many others!) my complete gratitude for sharing the tools that have helped you heal from the hellishness of candida overgrowth. It has really inspired me to read through the success stories here. I’ve been feeling at my wit’s end-SO exhausted and depressed from feeling sick for so long…and I’m happy to say that the info here has given me hope! I’m here-ready to make some serious changes in my life-enough is enough. I just lost my maternal aunt to serious health issues (blood sugar/kidney issues) which I am sure were caused by or at the very least exacerbated by years of eating a highly processed/starchy/sugar laden diet. This has always been the norm in the family and this has been a very sobering ‘wake up call’ for me. I’m on the same path with pre-diabetes and a raging candida overgrowth. I’ve become the perfect host for Candida-I ate ‘crap’ for years before I changed my eating habits for the better! Took many courses of antibiotics for reoccurring sinus infections in my 20’s and then sent it all over the final edge several years ago with spine surgery (was pumped full of antibiotics again.) Looking back-I’ve been dealing with candida symptoms for a good 20 years now! I’ve had constant skin issues (rashes, eczema, athlete’s foot), headaches, severe allergies (sinus issues, sore throat, watering/itching eyes…) stomach/intestine cramping, constant colds & flu-like symptoms…the list goes on & on! Not that I’d wish this on anyone! But it gives me hope that I’m not alone in this! I really appreciate all of the info here on the forum-feeling a little more empowered tonight!! Thanks! -cat"
0,HeatherJ,148,"This is such a drastic lifestyle change. Does anyone have any funny stores to share about their experiences while making this transition and/or dealing with it all? I will start with mine. I’ve been having really bad food cravings. Before I did the cleanse, I followed the regular Candida diet for about a month. I’d been eating GF in the months preceding (The selection of GF foods here in The Netherlands is minimal, so this was a drastic change to begin with) So I have been passing on the goodies for longer than just a week. Anyway, my family is really sick of me smelling their food. The other day my husband came home and I greeted him with a hug. I sniffed the collar of his shirt. “Oh! YOU HAD A BIG MAC! You smell sooooo good!” I shrieked. I began to sniff him some more. He laughed. “Uhhmm, no. I had a salad. You’ve got it bad. Do I have to worry about you eating me in my sleep?” Too funny!"
1,bouncygal,148,"for about the first 3 weeks i would wake up freaked out and guilty after having dreamed i ate cake,chocolate or cookies, it would take me 10seconds to realise it was just a dream. I even had a dream within a dream about eating sugary foods. I don’t dream about sugar anymore, but i still crave it if i see some moist chocolate cake on tv. Before the diet i didn’t even really eat cake but some how it comes to my mind whenever i crave the non diet lifestyle. x bouncy"
2,SueSullivan,148,"Boucygal, I’ve done the same thing! Dreamed that I had drunk a coke, of all things and felt horrible about the damage I’d done.  Heather, I love your story!"
3,shayfo,148,"I think I dreamed about eating gummy bears at least once a week for the first two months of the diet. I didn’t even eat them before the diet! (I’m vegetarian/vegan and they nearly always contain gelatin.) But DURING my dream I’d be like NO NO NO WHAT DID I DO then wake up and be like “Wait…um…okay. No. It’s fine. It’s fine! It’s fine,” but feel slightly panicky for a few minutes. Yesterday, I was hanging out with some sorta crusty punk friends after a meeting we had and one went on a beer run, and asked me if I wanted anything. I said something like, “Goddamn it, really? I want celery, asshole,” being really snarky, and went back to eating almond butter (woo stage 2!) with a spoon because I was pretty hungry after being too busy to eat for most of the day. When she came back from the liquor store, she walked up and dropped a bag of celery on my lap and walked away to give everyone else their tall cans. It was a pretty silly moment (and also nice of her, haha). Also, Heather, pretty funny that your husband smells like burgers even when he doesn’t eat them…or that you’re having olfactory hallucinations of fast food desperation 🙂"
4,alexalgebra,148,"I definitely can relate to the food dreams! I have had several where I cheated and binged on cake – something I never ate all that much of before…I think cake is kind of gross! I have stayed at my cousin’s place a couple of times since starting the diet and he now gives me crap about the “Alex smell” that happens when I stay there. Several people, actually, have commented on the smell…not from me personally, but from my veggies. I forget that most people think cooking vegetables makes everything smell like a big fart :p I just think MMMM VEGGIE FARTS!!! LOL!"

1,lita11,149,Yes incredible but congratulations on your success. Your direction to get success are quite amazing.
0,magnarsson,150,"I’m sure it has been an issue for many more years but my first REAL crisis came in 2009. I was in an unhappy relationship, a job I didn’t like and I compensated by eating a lot of sugar. A LOT! I remember the tipping point, it was a chocolate cake. I had 2nds and 3rds and after that, my life changed. After that point, whenever I would eat something with any carbs in it, I would enter this drunken stupor. I had trouble concentrating, I couldn’t do basic math, and everything that was aggravating in my life just became 10x worse. I was aware of candida and I knew it was the culprit so I had to enter into a treatment protocol as outlined by my naturopath and the time. The only thing I could eat was brown rice, green veggies some meat (turkey, fish and chicken). I was on that diet for 5 weeks, also taking a bunch of supplements. The Dr also did some tests to see what anti-fungals were best for me… apparently caprylic acid tested ineffective so I had to use other alternatives. It cost me a ton of cash (I think the Dr upsold me a bunch of stuff I didn’t need and squeezed as much $$ as possible). Despite that, I went through the diet and felt somewhat better after I was finished. I ended the diet with a prime rib and got horribly sick :/ I made some horrible decisions though during those bad moments when I couldn’t think straight.. I can’t imagine all the decisions mankind have made under the influence of something like this. And now I find myself battling it yet again.. although not quite as bad as round 1. I had a colonic a couple months ago and ate refined sugar too soon afterwards. It’s a slippery slope and I found some familiar symptoms returning. I had another colonic last week and I’ve made it a priority to do it right this time and to take care of this once and for all. I ordered some supplements which include: – Candex: Yeast Management System. Any one have any experience with this?? – Saccharomyces Boulardii – Jarro-Dophilus EPS Since I live in Bali, I don’t have the luxury of obtaining refrigerated probiotics so those will have to do. But what makes matters worse is that I just got a call from customs saying they need special paperwork for my shipment, which I don’t have, which I have no idea how to provide. It looks like the shipment will be sent back. Arrghh. So for now, I’m relying on yogurt, kimchee and an older batch of ‘body biotics’ which I’ve heard is an excellent supplement. I also just polished off some Natren probiotics (Superdophilus and Bulgaricum) that I brought with me a few months ago.. a miracle that I’ve been able to keep them cool in the fridge despite moving so many times. So now I’m on day 5 of no carbs and I feel like absolute garbage. I’m excited to have some oat bran today so I can at least get a bit of energy. And that’s kind of what’s going on so far! Drew"
1,Able900,150,"Hello, Drew, and welcome to the forum. I wish you had found the forum before you purchased your supplements. You can’t take S. Boulardii and the Jorrow probiotic during the same period. Jorrow contains lactic acid bacteria which has shown antifungal properties against yeast, S. Boulardii. The same goes for drinking kefir and take S. Boulardii during the same period. Some believe you can take one of these in the morning and one at night, but I personally don’t believe this would work because most of the lactic acid bacteria are going to live and still be around when you take the S. Bourlardii. We have a protocol on the forum, and one of the sections is about Probiotics . This information will tell you exactly which probiotics are most useful in the treatment because they’ve been tested by forum members. Candex is not going to help you either, so I wish you had not already wasted your money on it. In your private message to me requesting the strict diet, you mentioned that you were considering flying to an area where you could obtain the correct probiotics, but remember that you also need to drink kefir every day after around two weeks on the diet. If you can afford to make this trip, I would seriously consider doing so. Check your inbox for the diet information. Able"
2,magnarsson,150,"Hi Able, Thanks for the reply and diet info. I was unable to receive my order at customs so it looks like it’ll be returned to iherb. I should be able to get a refund so not a huge loss. Thanks for advising on the probiotics. As I mentioned, the chance of getting good quality kefir and probiotics is minimal as the only thing I’ve seen is commercial goat’s kefir so not sure how to best approach it. Getting stuff sent in ice packs isn’t likely going to do much either considering how long stuff takes to get here. Aren’t there suitable probiotics that don’t require refrigeration? I’m considering a visit to Bangkok so perhaps there are more options there. For now I’m just continuing with the diet and with the ‘body biotics’ probiotics. It doesn’t help things that I’m needing to avoid most saturated fats either (coconut oil, butter, etc..) on this modified diet so I’ll do my best. It sucks being so hungry all the time, no matter what you eat! Gotta work with what you’ve got 😉 Drew"
3,lita11,150,I think you should try to eat more and more vegetables and fruits. There is another thing that you should properly complete your sleep. Most of the people are prey of candida due to incomplete sleep.
0,alexalgebra,151,"Hey y’all! I’m home from all of my travels and thought I’d give you an update of where I’m at. First of all, I survived! Yay! I stuck to the diet pretty much completely through everything, minus a couple of small mishaps (that I discussed before). So basically, I went on tour for a couple of weeks, was home for 8 or 9 days, went out for a couple more weeks on the road, was home for a couple of days, then went to sleepaway camp to be a counselor for 8 days…all of that added up to about two months of traveling and craziness this summer. The main lesson I learned is that even if you stick to the diet completely, all is not well if you push your body too hard and don’t get enough sleep. I definitely got pretty crappy on the last few days of each leg of my travels due to sleeping an average of 6 hours a night, plus the stress of travel. At this point in my recovery, that looked like me feeling really achy and getting incredibly irritable and snappy with people. I have added a few foods back into my diet, with some failure and some success! The successes are unsweetened vanilla hemp milk, small amounts of carrots and tomatoes (like 1/3 of a carrot over a few days, a couple of bites of tomato in a week), coconut milk (I was reacting, now I’m not, yay!), small amounts of tahini, small amounts of coffee, and green tea. My failures are lots of carrots and tomatoes, lots of coffee, too much tahini…you get the idea…basically a little bit of things here and there seem to do me well, but if I indulge too much, things are a problem. One step at a time! I’m currently still recovering from my travels and I am pretty exhausted. I’ve gone back to work, but yesterday that looked like about two hours of work and three hours of nap to recover. Today I worked about five hours and only had a one hour nap. Progress! I also have an out of town guest that is causing a bit of stress, so I’m sure when she leaves, I will be right as rain in a day or two. It’s really hard having to deal with someone else when you can barely take care of yourself :p All I want to do right now is hide away and watch TV and sleep. I tried to go for a walk in the park the other day and it didn’t go so well. I’m sure I’ll be fine by next week, but for now, my body is basically like fuck you, let me sleep, LOL :p I’ve also cut back on anti-fungals (just doing a little maintenance a couple times a week and continuing to cook with coconut oil and eat food antifungals) as well as probiotics, and I think I’m doing pretty well. It was really difficult to take pills with any regularity while I was gone, so I fell pretty far behind with any and all supplements. I’m basically down to probiotics and vitamin C at this point. All in all, aside from just being wiped out from two months of gogogogogogo, I’m feeling pretty well. It’s been three days since I’ve been back, so that’s a pretty quick recovery time. Hope everyone else is doing well!"
1,msmofish,151,"Hi Alex Welcome back & thank you for your update ! I always enjoy & learn from your posts so thank you !! I have a few questions: – what happened when you overdid it on carrots, tahini etc ? How did you know you overdid it ? – what antifungals do you use & how much when you say maintenance ? – and what supplements do you think you are lacking in ? Right now I’m taking probiotics, Vit C & ashwaghanda only. I did over 3 months of all the supplements & figured that was enough. I’m open to suggestion on this Again thank you for your inspiration Best Mo"

I think if I were in better shape overall (ie sleeping and not running myself ragged scrambling across the country and after teenagers for the whole summer), then it wouldn’t have been as big of a deal and I could tolerate more. 2. I have a backup supply of “yeast free” I think it’s called? It’s got some berberine stuff in it, which i know kills all bacteria, but it’s the only anti-fungal that I actually feel like it works…I did a few bottles of SF722 and it just felt a little more weak compared to this stuff. The yeast free stuff is kind of for “emergencies” I guess? Like when I accidentally ate something with sugar in it, or ate too many carrots or just started getting itchy butthole…that’s when I’m like OKAY PILL TIME! Otherwise, I just cook everything in coconut oil and eat rutabagas and brussels sprouts pretty much daily. 3. I don’t think I’m lacking in anything supplement wise, I think? Mostly I’m just lacking in sleep and calmness. I am really looking forward to an empty house."

Of course, a lot of foods made me sick because I also have Leaky Gut with a few food allergies thrown in there (eggs big time, dairy w/exception of goat, and a few beans). I haven’t tried coconut milk since starting the diet. I’ve been thinking about taking some of my goat milk kefir crystals and trying to make coconut kefir for some variety.

0,DaughterNature,152,"Hello all, A quick update: I am 4 weeks in to the strict diet. Today I started buckwheat soba and I have been eating oat bran regularly as porridge for 2 weeks. I eat lots of broccoli, cauliflower, sauerkraut (homemade), kimchi (homemade), rutabaga, kale, okra, cucumbers, bell peppers, onion, kefir, coconut oil, and olive oil. a few days ago I added chicken and about 2 weeks ago I added fish. I experience much less bloating and gas now. I started taking GSE on July 16th, about 2.5 weeks into the diet. After a week I switched to red thyme oil which I am on currently. I will switch between the thyme and oregano oils for as long as necessary. Before meals I have ACV in water, molybdenum, Swedish bitters, and 2 yucca root caps. After meals I take 1 betaine HCl and 1 Mag/Cal/Zinc. After an oily breakfast I take Vit A, D, D3, and E. Twice a day I take 2 (175 mcg) milk thistle caps. I take Vit C in between meals and at night. I drink nettle leaf tea, slippery elm tea, and lots of water. I will start drinking more rose hip tea. 1) Is 3 months too long to be on anti-fungals? 2) What should I do since I cannot take a significant commercial probiotic until October (3.5 months into the diet…)? Does this have a negative affect on my treatment? 3) How long should I consume the AVC for good digestion? 4) When should I start taking biotin? SF722? Lactoferrin? 5) How do I prepare milk thistle tea from whole seeds? Thanks y’all."
1,Able900,152,"1) Is 3 months too long to be on anti-fungals? You’ve been on the diet for four weeks, are you saying you were on antifungals for two months prior to starting the diet? Normally around the three month point you should begin to concentrate more on reestablishing the flora with probiotics and kefir. Of course, this will always depend you the state of your infestation.2) What should I do since I cannot take a significant commercial probiotic until October (3.5 months into the diet…)? Does this have a negative affect on my treatment? Of course I can’t honestly say that this will have a positive effect on your treatment, but sometimes we have few choices and have to make do with what we have.3) How long should I consume the AVC for good digestion? If you’re taking HCl after each meal, I think you could stop taking the AVC for now.4) When should I start taking biotin? SF722? Lactoferrin?You can start biotin at any time. If you do so, I would discontinue one of the antifungals. After being on the biotin for about two weeks, you could start the SF722 providing your die-off is not severe.  Whether or not you take apo-lactoferrin depends on your iron levels. You shouldn’t take this unless your iron level is low.5) How do I prepare milk thistle tea from whole seeds? Preparing Milk Thistle from Seeds Able"
2,DaughterNature,152,"Hi Able, No I have not been on anti-fungals for that long. I just started my first anti-fungal (GSE) a couple weeks ago. I want to know if I should continue anti-fungals until I can start my commercial probiotics in October. I understand now 🙂 Since I will start the biotin today I will eliminate the thyme oil for now, right? So when should I take another anti-fungal (either thyme or oregano) other than my coconut oil? Should I continue biotin when I start up the thyme/oregano again? Thanks, Able!"

I would leave the antifungals which also contain antibacterial properties alone for now. You could continue to eat rutabaga and add Brussels sprouts to your diet as natural antifungals. Avoiding certain antifungals with antibacterial properties means using coconut oil, SF722 when you can get it, and of course the natural antifungal foods I mentioned. Continue taking the biotin until a later date, we can talk about that later as it depends on how your treatment progresses. Remember that it’s possible for biotin to cause die-off symptoms, so start with a small amount. As far as the probiotics are concerned, eating sauerkraut (homemade), kimchi (homemade), and drinking kefir should help you a lot. Able"
4,tanyanurse,152,Is GSE recommended?
5,DaughterNature,152,GSE destroys the beneficial bacteria; Able does not recommend GSE as an ongoing treatment for this reason. I took it as my first my anti-fungal and do not plan on introducing it again since I have started eating more kefir.
6,DaughterNature,152,"In addition to the Cal/Mag/Zinc tablets I also plan to take additional zinc tables to aid digestion. Able, can you recommend a daily dosage, ideal timing during the day, and a length of time that I should take this supplement? Thank you."
7,DaughterNature,152,"Able, I cannot get my blood tested for another few months. Would it be safe to do 5 rounds of the Apo-lactoferrin although I do not know the whereabouts of my blood-iron levels? Also, I had a relapse today. My digestion was doing extremely well, I was eating smaller, more frequent meals, having harder stool, and less bloating. Then, today I had a movement that–once again–was full of food pieces. Perhaps it’s all the kefir I’m drinking. I do chew my food very well and take the Swedish Bitters after every meal. Thank you, as always."
0,travler2001,153,"Well, today is day 3. I went straight into stage 2 and skipped the cleanse. I was desperately ill and falling behind in college from the candida. Between the nausea, headaches, dizziness, joint & muscle pain, and consistent feelings of being right about to pass out, I was wondering if I was gonna end up dying from this. That’s when I took a week off school and started eating quinoa and all these other amazing foods that I’ve never really had before. I’m following the candida diet to a tee..I even baked myself some coconut flour bread. I’m taking liver cleanse herbs and molybdenum. The results are phenomenal! I already feel healthier right now than I have my entire adult life! And for some reason, the strange new foods taste wonderful to me and fill me up really well. The swelling in my thyroid has now gone away. All the other symptoms are now gone, except I have a scant amount of psoriasis still hanging on for dear life. My psoriasis is almost gone though. I feel clear-headed and really energetic. This morning I woke up and felt young again..like I did when I was eleven years old. This has certainly already exceeded my expectations. Soon I am starting probiotics and after that the antifungal herbs. God bless the internet and natural medicine."

0,ccmt19,154,"Hello, everybody. Please do some confirmations about my case: 5 years ago, I had ultra-virus fever, my docs gave me a lot of antibiotics and from now on I fart a lot.  3 years ago, I though it was because of my stomach or colon and use more antibiotics to treat it. One day, i feel leaky gas and burning in anus. I suffer from that heat sensation and more symptoms (tired, abnormal stools, diarrhea and constipation, heartburn, black stools, bellyache, fever ..) 2 years ago, a doc gave me BDD (act on liver) the symptoms down quickly but come back after 1 month. 1 year ago, I tried a easterner medicine which contain antifungus properties and another treatment on liver. The symptoms again disappeared for 1 month. and back. I recognized that: Candida developed it immune system after 1 month I have stringy stool. when I consumed sugar or stress, I feel more sick. vitamin D (stimulate candida) boots my symptoms. I have used 4 days of oil of oregano (got burping, some light fever), 1 day of coconut oil ( use a lot coconut oil and got fever, dizzy, headache, bellyache, burping, tired) and on a strict diet again Candida I got really fast results in spit test. Am I on the right path? what else should I do now anyway?"

Three years ago, it was a long story… of course, in theoretically, antibiotics must be prescription-only. however, in my country, they are not really strict on this. especially, the easterner medicine they don’t really need prescription. in my case, i came to the doctors and they gave me medicines. but I was lost my mind and go to many of them. took a lot of antibiotics at the same time.

0,momma1,155,"Hi Everyone, i need help. I’m hoping there are women out here who will read my story and let me know if they went through the same thing i am going thru now and how they dealt with it all. I have candida, had for 5 years just didnt know it but have been actively fighting it since June. I’ve been seeing a naturopath and he has helped tremendously. My symptoms of Candida included: fatigue/brain fog/joint pain/digestion issues (mainly constant diarrhea)/flatulence/anxiety/infertility. the list keeps going but these are the ones i remember now. In June he prescribed me digestive enzymes, probiotic, anti fungals, and liver/kidney support. By the second week my diarrhea (which was the main problem) had started to form. by the next visit a month from the first, i felt so much better it was so promising. At my second appt is when he told me that during this time, i will start to get fertile again and advised against getting pregnant. He didn’t think i would get fertile though until my third month in. well too late, i was already pregnant and didn’t know. Just yesterday, i realized i am now 5 days late and took an at home pregnancy test which showed a faint positive sign 🙁 A few months ago i would have been so thrilled but now, i’m devastated. i know that candida will thrive on my hormones and i’m worried that all my symptoms will come back and i will regress. My next apt with him isn’t until 9 aug and i’m meeting with my ob-gyn this friday to confirm. I guess what i’m going after is please let me know if you got pregnant during your battle with candida and how the fight went. Did you stay at a stand still with treatment? did you get worse? did the candida come back with a vengeance? what antifungals can we still take during pregnancy? what can i do to keep the candida at bay? any type of advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"
1,Able900,155,"Hello, and welcome to the forum. Over the period of time that I’ve been on the forum there have been several members who were pregnant and also had a Candida overgrowth. The most successful story to date I believe was written by “Hope.” Hope was not only suffering from a Candida overgrowth during her pregnancy, but she was also on antibiotics several times during the time she was pregnant because of UTI’s.  You can find her posts in this link, starting with her very last post made after her baby was born back in September, 2011.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_search.aspx?postedby=Hope I would suggest that you start the diet that the forum uses if you’re not already doing so, if you decide to do this, just let me know and I’ll send you the link. I also think you should read the Forum Protocol  and follow it for the most part. The one thing you should do differently is to avoid all antifungals other than coconut oil in the beginning. Coconut oil will not only help your treatment progress, but it’s also extremely healthy whole-food supplement for both you and the baby at this time. After you’ve reduced the number of Candida sufficiently to prevent severe die-off, you could add SF722 to your treatment. But your goal (other than reducing the Candida) should be to create as small an amount of the die-off toxins as possible. This is not only healthier for you, but it’s imperative as far as your baby’s health is concerned. Please keep us posted in this thread as far as your decisions and your questions are concerned. Thank you, and much good luck to you. Able"
2,momma1,155,"HI Able, i will read up on Hope’s story and do my research. My biggest worry is that the symptoms i had will come back. they were so dibilitating, i’m scared it will make me lose my job. I have known that i have candida for quite sometime now and have actively been fighting for two months now. my diet is similar to your diet but i will make the necessary changes that i need to. i will also stop the antifungal i am currently using (its a mix of almost everything in one tablet) and will only use coconut oil accoriding to your protocol. and yes, i will post my progress, i need the support of the community at this time. it’s hard for my boyfriend to understand what i’m going thru."
3,momma1,155,"Hi Able, i wanted your opinion regarding the diet. i tried following your diet from the beginning (minus the detox cleanse) but i’m finding it a bit hard with this pregnancy. for the most part, i feel pretty drained throughout the day and some of the foods make me nauseous. do you think it would be okay to skip to phase II and add in the coconut bread, etc a litte at a time? i think the extra calories will help a bit. Also, my OBGYN was okay with me taking the probiotics, anti fungals (although i have been using only coconut oil the last couple of days), and the liver/kidney cleanser but she wasn’t so sure about the digestive enzymes because she didn’t have enough knowledge to come to a conclusion. do you have any background on those?"
0,Nat,156,"So I’m at the very end stages of my diet and the cravings are kicking in worse than ever. I was never addicted to chocolate, but now I can’t stop thinking about it. I worry about what is going to happen once I finish. Although I feel better and the diet has helped me get rid of symptoms I’ve had (unrelated to Candida), the Candida infection itself has not disappeared. I still get vaginal discharge every day. I’m just thinking that I might abandon the diet. It should have cleared up by now, right?"
1,rdj123,156,I’m at about the same spot you are. I was hoping to stop after 2 months but still having symptoms. I wish I knew how much longer. I think if I knew I was only a month away I could do it but what if I’m another 6 months or a yr away. The uncertainty is killing me. I keep telling myself that I’m almost there but soon I’m going to stop believing myself. They say wait two months and then see how you feel but for me it’s tough to know. As long as I keep havig die off symptoms how will I know when I’m done?
2,msmofish,156,"hi we suffer from a very pernicious fungus that won’t give up. From what I’ve read here on the forum it takes 6-18 months to be symptom free And from what I’ve read here, if you go back to your old diet before you are symptom free the candida infestation comes back worse than ever.

6,Nat,156,"Hi Able, I am almost 2 months in now and according to Lisa Richards’ program that should be the end of the diet. My diet generally looks like this (dinner varies each day) – breakfast: oat bran or eggs with coconut bread  – recess: no-fat yoghurt with flax seeds or almonds. Sometimes seaweed. Sometimes avocado dip  – lunch: ready for this.. a salad. A boring salad. Occasionally I’ll have quinoa with breast chicken… but that depends on dinner leftovers – afternoon: almond butter brownies or pumpin seeds or more coconut bread – dinner: this varies. If I’m unprepared it’ll be quinoa with chicken and broccoli. I usually end up steaming veggies and making a couple eggs, or an omelette with quinoa / oregano + olive oil. Soba noodles and seaweed is another treat. Chicken curry is also good (with coconut milk and cumin/ garam masala etc). I am not good at cooking so my meals are very basic. In response to your second question, I think it’d be better to ask if it would make it worse. I have started reintroducing minor foods and haven’t noticed a change in symptoms. I’ve obviously benefited a lot from the diet, but it hasn’t gotten rid of the problem. So I don’t know the answer! Cheers,  Nat"
7,DaughterNature,156,"Hi Nat, You might want to try the Protocol diet. It is much more strict but I have felt positive results in each week. You’d definitely have to cut out cheat foods like cheesecake for quite a while but in my case healing is the priority. I wish you good health!"
8,Nat,156,"Haha thankfully I don’t regularly cheat on cheesecake, I’ve just broken once. What is the protocol diet? I’d hate to see anything that’s stricter than what I’m currently on. I’ve lost way too much weight already and people say I look malnourished (even though I feel really good). Sigh…"
9,DaughterNature,156,"Ugh! I understand your struggle. I went from 120 to 106 in a few short weeks and all the sudden I had an “eating disorder” as my father says. People don’t understand that this weight loss is just part of the process of healing for most people. I am so glad you are feeling better–even with the non-strict diet. Contact Able900 for the Protocol. It is a recommendation for candida sufferers based on what others have done to cure their infestations. Able cured himself using the supplements and foods listed. It is a bit pricy to start but I find myself spending less money on eating out, meat, and other things that the diet does not allow. Before you give up, I want you to try the strict diet for 3 weeks. It is a long time considering that you want to give up the less complex diet from the website. I used to have a discharge all the time but after starting the protocol the discharge and even the itching (which I’ve had since I can remember) went away after 2 weeks. It’s an investment of $$ and willpower but I think you’d be impressed by the results. By the way, I now weigh 115 lbs, I work out, and I have so much energy. I feel like I “know” my body now… I hope you do it!"

0,SueSullivan,157,"I’ve been dragging my feet on starting the strict diet, but I’ve been reading steadily on the forum for the last week or so and I’m now thoroughly convinced that this is what I need to do. What has helped get me over the threshold of my resistance is a combination of posts from various people, and I would credit you all, but it’s things I’ve read over many days now and I don’t remember everyone’s forum names, so apologies for not citing everyone by name: I have really appreciated reading the Candida dairies of various people. It was particularly helpful to me to read diaries of people who are not following the strict diet and who are still experiencing major symptoms months into their treatment. It was also helpful to read the recent post from someone who was following her naturopath’s less strict diet and advice and was feeling much better (as I am already) but found that her candida levels had barely budged after a couple of months. I really appreciated one poster who said that when she feels deprived by the diet, she reminds herself that at least she is not battling cancer and its horrible treatments. This really struck home for me, as I have a friend who just finished up a year of breast cancer interventions and when I want to complain about the strict diet, I will just remember all that she has gone through. Lastly, I just realized that my nurse practitioner in the holistic clinic that I paid well over $1,200 for stool and blood tests, supplements and office visits — the person who pinpointed the candida in the first place — put me on digestive enzymes that include cellulase. Her advice for treating this has been poor to say the least. Also, I just bought a $23 bottle of Candidase at the natural food store because they didn’t have Candidate but highly recommended this instead and it’s just loaded with cellulase. I’m done taking less informed advice, wasting my money and setting back my recovery. On with the strict diet and the protocol. I’m assuming I should stop taking any probiotics and antifungals and start taking them again according to the protocol schedule. I’ll continue on with the molybdenum, nettle leaf tea and milk thistle supplement. Thank you everyone, for sharing your stories and insights. There is no other place like this on the internet and I don’t think the forum’s value can be overstated. Sue"
1,Able900,157,"Hello, Sue.  Thank you for acknowledging the posts which have contributed to your decision to start our forum protocol and diet. As far as your probiotics are concerned, since you have already been taking this for a while, I would continue with it until you’ve finished the container. At that point, you could switch to one that is recommended on the protocol. Thanks again, Able"
0,hwc2020,158,"Hi everyone, Today is the last day of week 6 for me. I am so much better. My brain fog has lifted and I just feel better all over. More hopeful, more energy, better sleep and such a feeling of quiet strength that I can do it. The first 4 weeks were definitely not great. For those of you just starting it’s a good idea not to make lots of plans. I just was very low energy with a steady headache and weird feelings in my throat. I went away for 3 days on vacation last week and still stuck to the diet. I cooked and carried more food than I did clothing but I did it. We have our family vacation coming up and I plan to stay on it. Three days ago I began having one cup of organic green tea. Able, is that ok? I don’t feel badly from it. Anyway, good luck to you all and thank you for your constant support. This board is a life saver for all of us. Plus I was doing several things wrong before I found this forum. Feel good. Regards, H"

0,jnealeigh,160,"I am new to the forum (I’m on day 3 of the strict diet after a 3 day cleanse), and I’d like some input on the medications/supplements that I’m on. First, I’ll give the sort version of what has lead me here. I’ve been dealing with depression, anxiety, and PTSD for a number of years. I believe stress has had a huge impact on my health. In March 2010, I had a killer mononucleosis infection, from which I felt never I recovered. For months after the infection, my doctors were telling me that my continued exhaustion and fatigue were likely just re-infections. In the midst of my poor health, I made the stupid decision to go on birth control. By October 2012, my doctors were talking about chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. I got really upset with them, and started looking elsewhere for help. I then received a diagnosis of adrenal fatigue and a leaky gut, and Candida infestation is another piece of the puzzle. The meds: •	Lorazepam – for anxiety; 0.5mg at night to help me sleep. I’ve been looking into magnesium as a natural way to calm down, and get me off this med. I’ve tried weaning myself off, but the result is poor sleep.  •	Venlafaxine – for depression; 75mg/day •	Progesterone SR – 50mg at night. I had my hormone levels tested a few months ago by my doctor, and progesterone and testosterone were low. I know that increased progesterone can contribute to vaginal yeast infections.  •	Testosterone Cream – 0.5mL applied topically at night.  •	Allergy shots: 2 shots weekly; I don’t know what is in the allergy shots, but I know that they are very small levels of the things I tested allergic to, like weeds, grasses, pollens from wheat, corn, and some trees, and molds. I’m going to call my allergist’s office tomorrow to get more specifics. And the supplements: •	Adren-All, from Ortho Molecular Products; I take 4 capsules a day (http://www.orthomolecularproducts.com/ProductDetails.aspx?id=a424561e-5670-4c78-8f92-c0aa98862586) Includes (values are for 2 capsules): Vit A 500 IU, Vit C 200mg, Vit E 20 IU, Niacin USP 20mg, Vit B6 30mg (as Pyridoxine, Hydrochloride USP, Pyridoxal 5;-Phosphate), Vit B12 200mcg, Pantothenic Acid 350mg, Adrenal Concentrate (Bovine) 220mg, Eleuthero Root Extract 100mg, Schizandra Berry Extract 100mg, Licorice Root Extract 75mg •	Natural D-Hist, Otho Molecular Products (http://www.orthomolecularproducts.com/ProductDetails.aspx?id=e3dd50ed-7f02-4d19-9e2a-907d09d57923) Includes: Vit C (as Ascorbic Acid USP) 150mg, Quercetin Dihydrate 200 mg, Stinging Nettles Leaf 200mg, Bromelain (2,400 GDU/g) (from Pineapple) 50mg, N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine USP 25mg If you have any knowledge or experience with these drugs/supplements, please let me know.

If you ARE NOT ALLERGIC to bee stings, bee pollen – particularly local bee pollen from around where you live helps with allergies. It’s what the bee brings back from the flowers to the nest on it’s legs after going flower to flower. I just take a little pinch under my tongue and let it dissolve while trying not to swallow but spit out the bee pollen saliva and rinse my mouth out to limit as much as possible the sugars from getting into the GI track….the pollen gets absorbed sub-lingual. It’s also a great source of pantothenic acid. I’ll let the forum experts respond to your list of vits but, I can say right off the top you should consider increasing your Vit C levels MUCH higher: like between 5,000mgs to 8,000mgs per day. Studies have proven your body absorbs and needs much more vit C when ill, then when healthy. I’m at around 8,000 + MGS per day and haven’t reached GI tolerance (you’ll know what that is when it hits). A nurse at a clinic I used to volunteer with 2- years ago told me once as soon as she starts to feel sick, she increases vit C till she get’s “the squirts” and then backs off from there to figure out what level her body needed. If you have any knowledge or experience with these drugs/supplements, please let me know. It’s a long list, but it’s smaller than it once was:) Thanks, J Your supplement list is much smaller than mine, that’s for sure but, I’ve been so mal nourished for so long, I feel my body needs it. Though, Able thinks I’m wasting my money but, he’s got knowledge of how to balance out vits, particularly the B’s which I don’t so, rather than try to learn all that know on my own, I figure the good vits companies know what they are doing better than I do….I’m over 24 bottles of vits/mins per day, some I take only one capsule per day, others I take up to 9 per day: depending on what vit/min. Also, I buy into how vits/mins work as co-factors to each other: another topic too complicated for me to try to unravel at this juncture. I wish you only blessings and healing graces,  Flailing."

0,shayfo,161,"This past Friday was my 6-month candidaversary. For context, here’s my last major update, and the previous one is linked therein. Sooo, I don’t actually have much to say, except that I feel fine. Great, actually. I don’t ever remember feeling this healthy before in my whole life. My digestion seems completely fine since I quit eating anything containing glycerin, so my only remaining symptom is mild thrush. I’ve been keeping on with antifungals (VCO, biotin, soooo many brussels sprouts) to keep fighting that. I’ve reintroduced raw tomatoes, but very small amounts, and rarely (the equivalent of one small tomato or less, a maximum of three or four times a week). About four days ago, I reintroduced walnuts and have eaten a couple tablespoons (cooked in either oat bran or buckwheat granola) every day since. Neither of these foods seem to be causing any problems. They don’t appear to be having any impact on my thrush. I am probably going to add in a few other nuts and seeds, in small amounts, over the next few weeks. Otherwise, I don’t have any plans to reintroduce anything else until my thrush clears up completely. I feel like I’m at a pretty good place mentally with the diet these days. I’m so used to it now that it just feels like how I eat, not how I have to eat. (Not to imply that I don’t need to eat like this to stay healthy.) Oh, for anyone keeping track who doesn’t want to sift through the fungal laryngitis thread I posted a few weeks ago, my laryngitis and ensuing throat irritation/hacking cough have cleared up. Hooray. To follow up on my 120-day update‘s list of things I’ve learned, here’s a few MORE things I’ve learned: -having patience with feeling healthy is sometimes harder than having patience with feeling sick -the best way to get over a guy is to have an intense candida relapse directly related to him -how to make delicious approved granola bars -it IS possible to get burnt out on asparagus -cucumbers are just the BEST thing. the best. the best. -if I were to write a song about my rocky relationship with smoked paprika, I would probably timewarp to the 80’s and form Scorpions and write “Still Loving You” and then wait around for smoked paprika’s eventual skyrocket to fame and prestige in 2011-2013 so that it’d know how I feel about it. -thinking “I’ve been doing this for six months” sounds WAY WAY WAY crazier/more legit than four months or five months, just psychologically This update is a little free-form and silly, so if anyone has any actual questions about actual things for me, I suppose I can answer them."
1,goingnatural,161,"Haha, glad you are doing well. Congrats on your 6-month candidaversary!"
2,stovariste,161,"thanks for update Shayfo, I must say you are my inspiration at the moment, great posts, so positive."
3,stovariste,161,"reading again, are you using any probiotics? Kefir or? Was reading earlier that its good idea to keep with them even when on stage 3 (food reintroduction)"
4,shayfo,161,"Hey GN and Stovariste, thanks for the nice words. To answer your question, Stovariste, I make coconut milk kefir and drink about 10 ounces of it probably 6 days a week, and I try to eat homemade sauerkraut every day, though I’ve been kinda burned out on kraut lately. I also take Raw Garden of Life “Women” 85 Billion three times daily. As a disclaimer, this particular probiotic contains trace amounts of a lot of different fruits and vegetables, and thus carries the risk of allergic reactions for people with leaky gut. I personally haven’t had a problem with it."
5,Danny33,161,Great news! I too crush smoked paprika like its going out of style.

11,msmofish,161,It’s great to hear the success stories – thank you for sharing !! And I too would love copies of the “delicious approved granola bars” & granola Keep up the great work !! congrats Mo
12,hdispain,161,I agree with msmofish. Please share your granola recipe. I can’t seem to find a way to make the ingredients stick together without the use of honey. 🙁
13,shayfo,161,"So the granola is a variation of alexalgebra’s granola recipe, and then I add a “fudge”-like coconut mixture that hardens up at cool temperatures. I don’t measure anything, so bear with my complete lack of precision: Granola: mostly buckwheat some hemp (maybe 7 parts buckwheat to 1 part hemp) Toast buckwheat in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 7 minutes, stirring pretty continuously, or until toasty-smelling. Add hemp seeds. STIR CONTINUOUSLY OR THEY WILL BURN. They will probably burn a little anyway. When they start getting too toasty, turn off the heat and immediately pour the pan’s contents into a glass or metal bowl (to get them off the hot pan so they stop cooking). Stir in cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, ginger, clove, whatever. Add salt and stevia to taste. If you’re just making granola, to eat as cereal or whatever, you can also stir in some coconut oil while the seeds are still hot, so it melts and coats. Coconut binder for granola bars: approximately 3 parts coconut oil to 2 parts coconut butter/manna In a small saucepan over low heat, melt coconut oil and add coconut butter, stirring. If you like toasted coconut flavor, turn up the heat very slightly so the flesh in the coconut butter toasts a little bit, but be careful, because it can burn easily. This is a really quick process. To make bars, I put a 1/4-inch layer of granola in a glass loaf dish, and then poured the liquid coconut mixture over it and stirred it around to evenly mix. Stick it in the fridge, and when it’s hardened, take it out and cut into bars. I wrapped them in plastic wrap and stuck them back into the fridge, because it’s warm in Southern California these days. They’re super delicious and kind of like those “yogurt” candy-ish granola bars, but be aware that they need to be kept cool to maintain bar form. I’ve also made the coconut stuff by itself as a dessert — just coconut oil, coconut butter, stevia, salt, cinnamon, cardamom. I put it in a ramekin and stuck it in the fridge and ate it like coconut “fudge,” since that’s how the texture turns out."
14,msmofish,161,!! YUM !! I just bought a 5lb bag of coconut manna – I’m crazy about the stuff = nature’s candy ! Without it I’d be super miserable – it’s my guilt-free sweet treat Can’t wait to try this recipe thanks ! Mo ps – I live in LA where coconut oil melts when left out. Am now keeping it in the fridge because I swear it evaporates when it melts in the jar. Could be I’m crazy too 😉
0,shayfo,162,"Today is seven months! Hooray. If you want to get a little more context, you can read about my progress at six months, five months, and four months. If you love a little scandal and woe, there was also this incident between the five- and six-month mark, which developed into a lingering problem for a while, as detailed here. This month has been really great, overall. In addition to my previously noted addition of smallish amounts of tomatoes to my diet, I’ve also successfully reintroduced almonds, cashews, walnuts, sunflower seeds, and sesame seeds (and tahini). This may not sound particularly exciting in the grand scheme of things, but I find it to be nearly cartwheel-worthy. I tried peanuts once a few weeks ago, and they’ve been my one reintroduction failure so far. A grand total of 9 peanuts gave me diarrhea that day and acne within two days. Sort of a bummer, since peanuts and peanut butter are a lifelong favorite of mine, but feeling terrible isn’t a reasonable trade-off for comfort foods. I’ll try them again at some point and accept defeat if my body still isn’t into it. I’m sort of idling on introducing legumes for the time being until the last impossibly tiny, impossibly persistent bit of oral thrush subsides (my final symptom). I think they’ll be my next move, though I’m pretty honestly content to keep myself busy with new seeds and nuts every week or so. I just ate a salad the size of a terrier topped with sunflowers seeds and homemade tahini dressing, and it was so good I could cry. Don’t roll your eyes, SOMEDAY YOU’LL BECOME THIS. I mean that as both the hope and the threat that it sounds like :p I was incredibly tired for a lot of last week, but I think it had more to do with stress than anything directly candida-related. I was also eating less because I was freaking out about some things and not in possession of much food (one of the things), and I assume I can attribute some of my low energy to that, too. I’m feeling way less stressed this week, and my finance/grocery situation has been remedied for the time being, and I feel fine. Last week aside, one of the big improvements I’ve noticed in the past month or two is that I have a lot more focus. I’m an activist and community organizer, and I’ve been able to get a lot more involved in things than I ever have been — and without feeling overwhelmed, which I sort of thought was inevitable before. Being incredibly broke has led me to switch from coconut milk kefir to goat milk kefir. It’s approximately a third of the price per day. I feel like a shitty vegan, but I really can’t afford quality coconut milk right now. Barnmouse, don’t judge me 🙁 The other supplement-y protocol-y things I’m still doing are eating coconut oil like a fiend, taking vitamin C when I remember, taking 85bil Garden of Life Raw Probiotics 3x/day, eating brussels sprouts a lot (rutabagas are getting harder to find out of season), and eating a lot of homemade sauerkraut. I took biotin for a while after I first got thrush, but I don’t think I have in a few weeks because I’ve been eating pro-level quantities of brussels sprouts. I never took bitters or HCL or enzymes because I’m a broke fool, but my digestion is fine now anyway, so whatever. Don’t tell Able, guys. Just to continue with tradition, here are a few more things I’ve learned: -soaked almonds are most delicious if you don’t dry them back out -people get off your back eventually, at least in my experience. a lot of folks here mention that their families/friends/significant others aren’t supporting them, but I’ve discovered that the longer I eat and live this way, the more supportive everyone has been. -coconut oil is kinda gross when it’s not a) cooked into food, or b) very solid. it’s a creepy mucus texture in this weather. -to just eat coconut oil anyway. I’m not a toddler. -being healthy is worth it. seriously. it is. no fruit? WORTH IT. not eating at restaurants? WORTH IT. no bourbon? WORTH IT. These things will probably all be part of my life again at some point, in well-considered moderation, but I’m in no hurry. I might not get to eat peanuts EVER, and that’ll also be totally worth it. I feel healthy, and it’s fucking great, and I find self-sabotaging, short-term instant gratification pretty unappealing these days. -it gets even better, even after you think it’s already better 🙂 Questions/critiques/comments/accolades welcome."
1,Able900,162," Great job, Shay.  For the record, I think being where you are in just seven months is quite amazing. Here’s to one tough broad. Able"
2,Prizma,162,"It was great to read this story again, and again, and again … Thank you! I don’t have Able’s diet so far. Are olives allowed by it ?"
3,stovariste,162,"hey shayfo, must say, but little bit disappointed with your progress past month :(… its not your fault, its just you had such an amazing progress from beginning and give me prediction that you will at least be consuming like 20 new items from last stage of diet :). Furthermore I am really near you, regarding recovery and when I read your posts I see my self like in month or two in that position 🙂 but, this is actually proof that recovery is slow… and like you said its worth it… thanks for update though, great really!! regarding this:not eating at restaurants? WORTH IT. I am eating outside for months already… I have nice place near my workplace where they know me well since I am here for years already. They make me some chicken or scrambled eggs with ton of salad and some toasted vegetables (zucchini, green peppers, eggplant)… that’s mu lunch usually 🙂 when I am somewhere else, I get robbed by paying 100% of price and eating like 20% (choosing whats allowed and what’s not)"
4,shayfo,162,"Prizma, olives that are brined only in salt water or olive oil are fine. Most have other additives, so check labels carefully. Stovariste, honestly, I laughed out loud when I read your response. I feel like my progress has been absolutely stellar! I’m eating new things, feeling really great, and practicing moderation and patience about food for possibly the first time in my life. I feel good about my decision to introduce things slowly, because I’m getting a lot more useful information this way. Imagine if I’d bought a can of mixed nuts, since nuts are acceptable at this stage. After eating a couple of handfuls, I’d probably get sick from the peanuts, but I wouldn’t know if it was them or the hazelnuts, brazil nuts, almonds, cashews, or pecans that made me feel sick. I’d probably assume that I just couldn’t eat nuts at all, which would be shitty :p I’ve eaten at restaurants twice during the diet. Once, I got an omelette when an out-of-town friend really wanted to go out for breakfast, but I generally don’t buy eggs anywhere but at the farmers market (both because the restaurant obviously wasn’t organic, and also because I was vegan before the diet and don’t like to support commercial animal agriculture). Also, I was paying for toast that I didn’t get, and for cheese that I didn’t get, and that’s pretty silly. Not to mention that they probably cooked it in shitty soy or canola oil. The other time, I got a salad with another out-of-town friend when we were doing touristy things, but it was an $8 salad and I ordered $3 guacamole to use as dressing. An $11 plate of lettuce and cucumber and avocado is sort of a huge waste of money, at least to me. Overall, though, there’s basically nothing vegan and candida-friendly on any menu anywhere, so I don’t go to restaurants. Last time I had a run-in with it, my gluten allergy was still extremely sensitive, so I also generally avoid restaurants for this reason. Just because I don’t order bread doesn’t mean someone in the kitchen isn’t making my salad with their sandwichy hands. Cross-contamination has repeatedly proven to be a concern."

Mo, I work with a group that makes meals for hungry folks every Friday, and I end up in charge of cooking every other month…it’s been a huge adjustment to do that while not eating any of it :p Same sorta deal as your catering thing, I guess.

0,brigalyd,164,"Hello everyone! I’m ecstatic to have stumbled across such a supportive group of people. I am excited to embark on my candida-journey. I am 28 years-old and have been suffering recurrent yeast infections for approximately 8 months. It began after a diagnosis of shingles was misdiagnosed as cellulitis and I was put on heavy doses of antibiotics unnecessarily. I do not have health insurance, and have had to rely on the emergency room, Planned Parenthood and local reduced cost clinics for my treatment. I haven’t had the luxury of one doctor treating my symptoms and most hesitate to do anything other than write a prescription. I’ve taken several antifungal and antibiotics, metronidazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, triconazole and fluconazole. Some work better than others, but ultimately my vaginitis always returns. I live a polyamorous lifestyle, meaning I engage in emotional/sexual relations with more than one partner. Safe sex and condoms are always used, however my doctors usually use this information as an explanation for my problems without further discussion. My yeast infections generally occur around ovulation, the beginning of menstruation or after sexual intercourse. I used to think I had healthful eating habits, until reading this site. Although I primarily eat vegetarian/raw vegetables, I frequently do not eat full meals and snack on unhealthy foods. I occasionally smoke cigarettes, drink caffeine almost every day (diet sodas/coffee/black tea), alcohol, eat lots of cheese and bread, and the occasional sweets. I’m preparing myself mentally and physically to begin taking control of this issue myself. Good luck and congratulations to everyone else that has started this journey! Bridgitt"

3,shayfo,164,"It’s unfortunate (though unsurprising) that your doctors are using your lifestyle choices as a way to try to shame/blame you for your health problems. My vaginal yeast infections pretty much subsided when I quit eating gluten a few years ago, but prior to that, I noticed a couple of patterns. One, I would get a yeast infection for a couple days before starting menstruating nearly without fail for about a year. It would clear up when I actually started menstruating each month. I assume this is due to hormonal changes. Two, I would somewhat frequently get yeast infections after sex. I think there are a few reasons for this. I’m slightly allergic to latex, and I think the inflammation from this allergy would make me more vulnerable to infection. In addition to being made of latex, a lot of condoms are spermicidal, and it’s been my experience that spermicides contribute to vaginal yeast infections (I secretly call them vagicidal). The last big factor is that other people have yeasty mouths, and people that have been drinking beer or wine have even yeastier mouths. If you’re on the receiving end of oral sex (and as a liberated poly woman, I certainly hope you are!), you can have problems with someone else’s yeast colonizing for a while. It’s definitely happened to me before. And please don’t think I’m trying to slut-shame at all (I’m not, poly is the most accurate way to describe me as well), but I think having sexual encounters with new people presents us with a new set of microbes to deal with that our body has to learn to navigate, and the going can be rough at first if you have other issues compromising your health (like a general candida overgrowth or a bad diet, etc). Good luck with everything! I hope you have success getting your health back."
4,Bethanyhere,164,"I started having an infection about 2 or 3 months ago..started taking probiotics and not drinking as much alcohol, and the symptoms seemed to subside. But then after my last period I started having this discharge- and not from my bladder. I asked my friend, who’s pretty educated on holistic healing, and told her the last time I’d ever had a yeast infection was when I was little. And she said, well that’s an indicator that you’re susceptible to yeast build up, and the fact that it’s traveled to your vagina (Vaginosis) means you have a chronic problem.  So I took out sugar & alcohol,and coffee and found the candida diet website, and have been following it for 4 days now. Has anyone had the same experience as me? with Vaginosis? Thanks!"
0,jacgues,165,"Hi guys, My problem started when i was 16 (I’m 20 now). My weight was about 55kg and i was 175cm tall. I’ve decided to start hard woking at the gym and eat everything i can – only callories matters. I was eating about 4,000 calories, which 2000-2500 of them was sugars – i even ate a sugar from a tea bag. The reason of all hat weird stuff was my complex – i was smaller and skinnier that my friends – i’m a pure ecto-morph. My face started covering with awful white pimples. I could wake up with 30 of them only in the face area! My head, chest and shoulders was covered with glue-like sticky sebum. Doctor prescribed me acne atibiotics (worst thing ever) without any probiotics! Tetracykline is very, very harmful to good intestine flora. I’ve taken in for couple of months. Btw. i didnt take any steroids! I’ve started to have mental problems – depressions, i was agressive, always tired etc. I’ve also experienced lot of drugs like amphetamine, mefedron, dekstrometorphane, marijuana, ketamine, cocaine and more. All of that stuff destroyed my brain and my body. When i was on drugs, my skin was turning yellow and my liver was hurting. Another dumb doctor prescribed me anti-inflamatory drugs and Omeprazolum. When i took omperazolum for the 5th day in a row, after gettin a flue and eating lots of sugars (fruits) i felt really, really bad. I was liein at the flor and my stomach hurted me so much. From that day, i ve a big candida problem, which is in my mouth, on my skin (hands and feets) and in my intestine of course. I’ve tried almost everythin and i cant cure myself. I’m tryin to focus on destroyin biofilm, which i obviously have and tryin to kill parasites. I’m not sure that i ve any, but my doctros thinks i do – any analysis didnt proove it. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm46066_Candida-biofilm-treatment-plan.aspx#post46066"
1,bouncygal,165,"Your taking alot of things, are you staying off sugar, wheat and dairy? I don’t even know what most of the things you are taking are but i read don’t take antifungals and probiotics at the same time because they cancel each other out. The mind also has alot to do with the healing, so whenever you take your medication imagine the candida getting weak and confused and unable to grow. Don’t worry about the drugs you have taken, its in your past your body is stronger then you think and it can heal. I was also a big user of “hard” drugs, but that was then and this is now. I’m not saying its easy, im saying you can do it! people on this forum help me get though the hard days, reading all the stories like my own. I’m cheering for you!! love bouncy"
0,ALEXANDER,166,"Hi All, Here is my first post. I am a man, 28 years old and this is my story for the past 18 years. At the age of 10, I was a boy full of energy who liked to eat all type of sweets you can imagine. That time I weighed 45kg. At the age of 12, I noticed white small verms with the stools and since I was young I thought this was normal! Between the age of 12-15, I passed the secondary school with stomach sick pains and one day it happened to explain it to my parents that maybe the verms in my stools were the reason. They urged me at the doctor and sent stool samples to the lab. I had a course of pills and monitored my stools every day and they seem gone after a month course. At the age of 16, although the verms were not being seen anymore, some of the stomach pain remained especially when drinking lactose milk and eating diary products especially chocolates. Again to the doctor and he said it was maybe related to lactose intolerance. He suggested to avoid all things related to milk since at that time there wasn’t a precise test to assure lactose intolerance. Between the age of 16-19, I forgot the taste of milk or cheese, I was better without but still not 100%. I was not getting the full replacement of protein/vitamins so I was often tired. At the age of 20 I began eating everything again, I felt stonger, full of energy again and decided to give it a try. One year later I was again at the hospital due to stomach pain. Hospital done tests and found bilirubin three times high above normal thinking that I had a liver disease. After some tests, it resulted that I had Gilbert’s Syndrome and they told me it was a common issue. At the age of 24 I was still having occasional stomach pain/bloating/smelly_gas/occasional_diahrea/Heartburn. Again to the hospital especially due to feeling uncomfortable when eating everything or a sense of nausea. I made a DUODENDUM MUCOSA test by using a camera into my intestine and came positive to FUNDAL GASTRITIS. I had been administered 3 types of drugs for a month, which during the intake of the drugs the feeling was more intense and I was almost lost in space for 1 month. After that, I came to normal and this time I was eating everthing and it was all feeling good until a year later symptoms were coming back again slowly again. At the age between 25-27, bloating is a main issue again and I am peeing very-very frequently at times, especially when I am tired. During the time I heard on tv by mistake that there was a lactose intolerance test. I rushed to this clinic and made an appointment. The test consisted in drinking a glass full of lactose and take blood samples every hour for 4 hours. At the test sceen I went 5 times diarrhoea plus my stomach was getting larger and larger. When talking with the lab proffesor said that it is a sign that I am positve to lactose intolerance! Infact I was stated positive. Today I am 28 years old, I am back to the diet of 13 years ago with no diary products but bloating is persisting all day, every day making life almost impossible to live normal. Now I was talking with a friend in work and he pointed me out to the candida extreme diet. The diet is very difficult to maintain but If I was sure I will feel better and for long this time, I will surely try to make my best to stick on it. Could be that all these years I was on Candida and I didn’t know? Is there someone here who is sure Candida and lactose intolerance at the same time? Note that since I was 15years old I didn’t got weight vary more than 2kg. Now I am 65kg."

2,Prizma,167,"stovariste, thank you for your reply. I am a 44 years old woman.  Two years ago my eight years old son had rectal bleeding and the doctors suggested it might be Crohn’s desease. Until the results of his examination became known I was absolutely shocked and in a very bad psychological condition. I stopped eating for a few days, I was under severe stress. This happened in May 2011. As of end of May I started having guts problems – often dhyarrea. I got hair loss. I went to a doctor who said it’s due to the summer period and prescribed me some probitics to take for two weeks.  At that time I developed oncophobia /fear of cancer/.  So I was constantly thinking of illnesses.  I started browsing the internet and found out I needed to make a test for Candida as my symptoms were similar. This happened beg. of January 2012. The result was intestinal Candida albicans. The doctor prescribed me probiotics for 10 days and advised to do the test again in 20 days.  It was negative.  At that time I didn’t keep any diet. After a couple of months I started having allergy, again hair loss, my stomach wasn’t calm. I did the test again. Candida albicans in significant quantities. This heppened in October 2012. In addition, my blood test was very bad – it showed lymhopenia.  Meanwhile I visited a doctor reg. the depression and phobia. It proved out due to that stress, I have developed Hashimoto desease.  I stared reading about candida, started the diet and in January 2013 the Candida was gone. I stopped the diet. In March – again Candida Albicans. In April it was gone. I took Nistatine at that time for 10 days as prescribed by the doctor. I made the diet, but after the negative test, I stopped it. Last week I started having the same problems – hairloss, dhyarrea. I did the test.  This time it is Candida NON Albicans. I have already started the diet, I take “Candida Clear” of IHerb and follow the advises I see here. What I undetrstand now is that I should not stop the diet after the Candida is gone. Maybe I must be on this diet for at least 6-7 months after the Candida is gone. I am afraid that the Candida might have already ruined my health as I have been living with it for such a long period. The depressia is here, but more frustrating that my fear of cancer is back again. Thank you for having the patience to read my story."
3,stovariste,167,"hi Prizma, you should maybe ask a question directly in forum, as they have more knowledge. As far as I can understand your state, you should first heal your fears stress sources somehow… Stress is one of the major sources of candida besides diet. After all, nobody of us can chose whether we will get cancer or not. Sometimes healthiest organism would develop cancer sooner then some other weak organism. There are tons of cases where elite athletes had cancer and in logical thinking that would be least possible. I know the case where person developed extreme stress by convincing itself that its having cancer, even if doctors assured it that its not the case… the person is now healing from candida :)… As for your cases where you say you healed candida, and then it got back… I guess reason might be too fast reintroduction of the food. Once you are sure you are better you must slowly reintroduce the food one item in 3-4 days, and then if you have no reactions introduce another item… and so on… (again, this is topic for experts, not me) Normally, somebody else (raster, able or some other expert) would already answer you here, probably they have not been in forum past few days."

If you continue visiting forum here you will see the posts where people realized they have Candida problem for 20+ years already, but they were healing from symptoms instead of healing the source of the problem. So your case is not that bad at all, I my self had first symptoms I think 2009… real problems started 2011 …"

7,stovariste,167," Thank you for your positive posts ! I learned from this forum that I shouldn’t introduce sugar at all in my food, right? Are you asking about strict-diet or diet reintroduction of the food stage? Well none of them should contain any sugar in form of sugar for sure. In reintroduction stage you could eat some green apple (half piece a day for tests or so), or some other fruit that contains minimum sugar. Regarding your state, its quite possible that your depression state source is Candida as well, as one of the symptoms is depression.. so you are then in endless circle, until you start thinking POSITIVE! good luck, and stay on forum as much as possible because people here are only able to understand you… read positive stories, it will help you"

10,Prizma,167,"So, I began a strict diet /green veggies + chicken from time to time/ and this is my fifth day on it. I feel pain in the legs, whcih I guess is the die-off effect. However, what really frustrates me is that my stools are becoming more and more loose with each day going by. I wonder if I am on the right track or it’s Candida overgrowth. Or maybe it’s due to this mainly green veggie food ? I am still on one teaspoon coconut oil. As I’ve started vitamins, the hairloss is reduced. How long /time frame/ a die-off could last ? Does it happen afterwards, that the stool become normal ? All this makes me really scared."
11,stovariste,167,"I am not sure did you prepare your self for the diet. There is so much information on the protocol that you should take 2-3 days to read it all and accept informations from it. For instance, you should first detoxicate your body before starting diet (the cleanse stage), so you would not get die-off that soon like you did. — the pain in legs indeed should be die-off, I remember I could hardly climb the stairs… muscle and bones pain, along with general fatigue and need for more sleep were my common die-off symptoms. Bad thing with die-off is that its so bad, and you feel bad, and you start feeling scary because you feel worse then before the diet -> and most of the people are giving up because of it. your stool description can also be die-off probably, at least it was with me.. it can be also because change in your diet. Check out die-of symptoms, diarrhea is one of them. you must include some things to prevent die-off, since die-off means your body is having more toxins then it can process and you must help it somehow. You should try to get molybendum, and milk-thistle. Milh thistle is actually silimarin, you can find it probably in any drugstore (all described in detail in forum protocol) You can increase your vitamin C intake up to 4000 mg a day (separated in 4 doses). You can drink lemon juice, it helped me a lot. Also what helps, nettle leaf tea. You must increase liquid, drink a lot of water… all these things are helping the body to detoxicate…"
12,Prizma,167,"I take milk thistle /silimarin/ and Vitamin C 1500 mg a day + two lemons a day.  I’ll increase the Vit C to 2000 mg a day as a start. I cannot find molybendum here.

The pain in the legs is not awuful, it’s more felt like slight fever so it doesnt’ bother me at this stage. Also, I do not feel tired or sleepy. But I feel strong morning anxiety. I drink more than 2L mineral water per day. How long did your die-off last? Your posts come of great suppor for me!"
13,stovariste,167,"my die-off was so strong that I had to take whole day at bad, since I took too much antifungals and I did not start slowly with increasing every few days. The point is to consume some antifungals for a period while you dont have any die-off with that amount, and then increase it by one measure and so on until you will finally have no die-off. If you make mistake, and have extreme die-off, then everybody will suggest you to either reduce or even better stop antifungals for a while (usually 2-5 days, while the body cleans up) People experts here would probably suggest you to stop any antifungal, including antifungal food since your die-off is maybe from the fact that you are not feeding it anymore. After you feel better, then you start with antifungals and probiotics… Dont go too hard, you must be prepared to take it all slowly and it will last probably from 6 months up to 2 years, depending from person to person. you will probably feel much much better after 3-4 months, both both mentally and physically… You are cured at the point when you dont have any die off even on biggest amounts of antifungals (e.g. 15 tsp of VCO a day), AND you dont have any of the symptoms, and you feel great… thats the point where you start slowly reintroducing food… stage 3 😉 good luck, and don’t give up"

0,Maxtoobad,168,"It’s become a buzzword in naturopathy, chiropractors, homeopathic doctors, etc. Do I believe I have Candida? I’m not sure, but from two books I read and the symptoms I have it makes sense. Here is how I believe I got this illness: Pretense I would go out on weekends for years binge drinking beer and not sleeping great. I would eat lots of crap on the weekend, but for the most part I ate healthy through-out the week–eating healthy meaning something completely different then what I considered it then. I would eat organic foods thinking I was being healthy when eating healthy involves much more, gorge on watermelons, eat lots of bread, etc. During all this time, even today, I’m what many would call “healthy”–I’m not over-weight, I have good muscle definition, I’m slim, strong. e.g. external healthy (which confuses the doctors). So in case you’re wondering what was and is my state of health. I can see somebody presuming all us “Candida” sufferers as being physically unhealthy, far from true. Even “healthy” people get Here were my symptoms during these times that I wasn’t very conscious of but now know were the pretense for something bigger to come. I had no idea anything of this was connected, nor do I now but I do believe their is a correlation between these–they are not merely co-morbid, happening independently:Tired all of the time.Craving for sweets (I never was a sweets person mind you).Sinus inflammation and sore throats; I thought these were just colds I was getting constantly.After going to the bars, I seemed to discover a pattern of getting “colds”My asshole would itch and I sometimes would have slight bleeding. What I thought at the time: Wiping to hard.From age 17 till now (close your eyes and ears, this is gross) sometimes but not always after ejaculating then going to pee it would burn.Constant mucus in the back of my throatAnxiety and panic attacks my entire life, but having many years were they didn’t exist and I was perfectly fineA pleuritic type feeling in my left lung So I had those symptoms but they were tolerable and they didn’t bother me much. I could have weeks or months or even sometimes years feeling fine and not having any problems. All was management and I felt “alive” still and not poisoned or ill. Crisis – Candida (if that’s what it is) unleashes For the last 4 years I’ve had three very close friends die, I had unstable relational issues, incredibly stressful job, legal issues, etc. In May 2012 my mom died to top it off and this was an extreme blow to me all the while maintaining my family, paying mortgage, etc. I was also working out constantly. I would workout all the time, especially intensely. I started getting stomach pain–GERD like feeling–so I started eating Tums like they were candy, and drinking pepto bismol by the bottle each day. I was doing this for 2-3 weeks. I started reading and found that not eating 3-4 hours before bed would solve this. I stopped the tums and pepto bismol and did this and the GERD went away! I had the sinus issues and soreness in my throat and went to the doctor, she prescribed me a z-pack, an antibiotic. I took this, and it did nothing for my sinuses. I ended up getting a white film all over my tongue and i thought it was odd. I didn’t think much about it. In January 2013 (a few weeks after the GERD issues) the “Candida” symptoms hit, and hit HARD. Here were the symptoms I was having:An electrical like feeling all over my headThe feeling as though I was sucking on something extremely sourSinuses inflamed and throat burningLymph nodes swollenMouth infections regularlyBody sore for no apparent reasonHands and feet getting VERY coldMy entire body felt poisonedI had muscle twitching everywhereI could NOT sleepEverywhere in my body felt inflamedMy vision felt delayedI would get very dizzy and would randomly get vertigoCONSTANT gas–every day every hour multiple timesBurping all the timeHiccups constantlyEars felt full of airDeveloped loud ringing in left earAsthmaHivesSkin would get red on cheeksPoor sleep–tossing and turning constantly at nightFrequent urination at night even though didn’t drink water before bed Patterns I Was Noticing I started noticing the following things:When waking up I didn’t feel as bad and after eating I started feeling ill in the afternoonWhen I felt most ill, my muscle twitching was more activeEating sugar seemed to exacerbate the problem. Food had a direct influence on how I feltEating certain things was causing IMMENSE gasDoctors all thought this was all psycho somaticI went to every kind of doctor and they said I was fine even though I recorded a video of my muscle twitching and printed off a health log/diary keeping track of thingsWhatever was going on, was turning into some sort of auto-immune problemI had/have cravings for fruit but even it causes symptoms Trials and Tribulations I started reading books on digestive wellness and other things of the like. I wanted to bypass the internet blogs, forums, etc., because there was so much pseudoscience it had my head spinning. After reading Digestive Wellness by Elizabeth Lipski and gut and psychology syndrome by Natash Campbell I realized this was a digestive issue causing all of this. I took the questionnaires in Elizabeth’s book and according to her, indefinitely had Candida. I started taking 80 Billion CFU Ultra Flora pills, ate the GAPS introductory diet, and followed the protocol. There was a marked difference in how I was feeling. The muscle twitching subsided, brain fog lifted 80%, allergies weren’t so intense, and many of the symptoms went away. The “poisoned” feeling, the worse of them all, went away. To test all of this to make sure it wasn’t bullshit I started eating sugary foods to see what would happen, and I ended up getting sick again. So I finally had some empirical knowledge of this–I had evidence sugar was doing something. To test further, I started eating what my allergist said to not eat and these things didn’t affect me. The allergist said all these symptoms were normal, “everyone has them” and laughed at me and told me to stop being a hypochondriac; the allergist was a waste of money. So I started feeling better following the protocol but it was expensive and I lost 20 lbs which was making me nervous. I felt better but not healed. I got tired of this and started eating normal again–much more conscious–allowing myself bread, and such. I got sick again. The problem with following the GAPS diet is $$. It cost money and takes lots of time. The probiotics are expensive and questionable. Here is what I was doing when I was feeling good however, on the GAPS protocol and following some of my own ideas thrown in:Taking Ultra Flora 80 CFU (Don’t know if this helped)Eating bone brothsSoups were my main foodsI chewed up my food very well so that nothing would be left to fermentI tried to eat meals that were small as to not cause problems with leaky gutGot good restDidn’t drink tons of water at a time, messing up my stomach Ph.Was taking colustrum (Don’t know if this helped)Took l-glutamine to help heal my gut (don’t know if this helped)Drinking only a mouth full of water, not giant gulps at a time. 8 glasses of water doesn’t mean each sitting, down an entire glass of water. I don’t know if this is a good or bad practice, but my intuition says its not good, same with over eating; seems this would cause leaky gut or other problems Current State When going on the GAPS diet, I get better. When going off, I get sick again. I do not have nearly as horrible of feeling as I did in January 2013. I feel markedly better, but I still feel ill and something is very wrong. According to Natasha Campbell, it can takes many months if not YEARS to heal. This illness was caused over very long periods of time, and it will take equal amounts of time to reverse it. I don’t feel great. I feel exhausted still, and I feel my body is overwhelmed by something. Since January I stopped the following:Drinking alcohol of any kindSignificantly reduced the amount of processed food I eat to almost zeroI cannot workout as much as I used to. I get very dizzy when working outI had to completely stop hanging out with drinking buddiesI go to bed as early as I can, but I for the most part I still don’t get optimal sleep. The best I was feeling following Natasha’s protocol I was getting decent sleep and felt food.I still eat some things that are not legal foods on the GAPS diet, which I presume contributes to some of my feeling but even strictly on the diet I get symptoms which discourages me The foods are eat mostly and feel best are:Turkey BurgersSoups of many kinds I experiment with and put greek yogurt in for probioticsBaked chicken (with bones)Bone brothsRaw vegetablesAs much leafy green foods as possibleEggs, organic bacon, etc Fruit seems to cause issues for me. If I eat fruit and take digestive enzymes it seems to help me not have bad reactions. Skepticism and Key Points First, I don’t know if I have Candida. In fact, there are so many species of Candida nobody really knows if Candida Alibicans is the culprit, but one this is certain–whatever is going on it is gastrointestinal related. Candida is so poorly researched and my doctors look at me like all the rest, like I’m insane when I talk about it–“ONLY AIDS PATIENTS GET THAT” Probiotics are iffy. Consumer reports found many to be bullshit. Did you know that the probiotics you buy in the store DO NOT colonize the gut? I found a few that can like S. Boulardii and Coagulans, but the lactobacilli family doesn’t colonize. Growing and packaging lactocailli is a much easier process and is the only microbials many companies are familiar with. These microbials can withstand a lot more than other types being why these are the big craze. They cannot make nor do they know about the other commensals in your gut. They know the lacobacilli are ok because they exist in our fermented foods however they don’t know about the others enough. Your stomach has hundreds or thousands of varying kinds of bacteria. How is taking a supplement with just 4-5 strains going build up all the hundreds if not thousands of bacteria that were killed over the years? First off, they market saying “take probiotics to build up your flora in your stomach” when these flora don’t actually colonize your intestines. Your flora was given to you by your mother, and it built up over MANY years from touching things, swallowing things as a kid, etc. Eating vegetables from the garden, etc. Even Natasha Campbell sells tons of probiotics, “BIO-KULT” brand, the author of the book I mentioned previously. I still believe most of what she says in her GAPS book–It was VERY informative by all means, but I’m a bit cautious about having found she sells tons of probiotics. So understand it’s possible people can have hidden agendas. Here is a better example: Look up all the Candida gurus on the internet, and you’ll find their probiotics costs 50-100 dollars. This is robbery and a scam. Nobody gives a fuck about you if they are charging that much. Dr. Jeff’s progam cost 900 dollars, but if you read all the testimonials, its all people saying “wow, I lost so much weight” when the program is clearly for Candida. He also is not a doctor. People are banking off this illness because for one, nobody knows shit about it. No guru actually suffered it. Understand that what a product claims as having 50 billion colony forming units might have had that AT TIME OF MANUFACTURE, not after it’s been freeze dried, encapsulated then sent through UPS or FedEx trucks across the globe to your house. Lactobacilli can dry out and be rehydrated however some microbes cant. This is why Lactobacilli are so popular because they can easily be shipped. Other microbes cant. Another key point is understand there are varying degrees of this illness. Some people have yeast infections, some have diarrhea, some people have systemic candidiasis where like me, their entire body is infused with it, presuming it’s actually “Candida”. You will find NUMEROUS candida gurus on the web. The talk about it as if they actually got a microscope and visually have studied this microbe. Basically all this knowledge turns into telephone, like when you were a kid; one person makes a claim, another person interprets it as truth and then emotions and ego gets involved which makes it all the more ugly. On the OPPOSITE end, you have those who are skeptical of everything, they think Candida is bullshit, they think only studies are the truth, etc. But the problem with this is there are thousands of diseases out there that do not have the funding for them to be fully researched nor are there enough people who have these sicknesses for them to want to research it fully in a labratorial and clinical setting. Correction: There probably are enough sick people with it, but nobody knows what it is because of all the comorbidities. You might have 5 different symptoms going on that are caused by the same thing, but the doctors think they are 5 different unrelated problems going on. They are not taught to think abstractly, but rather rudimentarily e.g. you go in and tell them your asshole itches, your farting and your sneezing, but they see that as two complete different problems. Candida from what I’ve gathered is only going to go away if you can get your immune system in check. To do that, you have to be healthy, to be healthy involves good healthy eating and doing things that do not foster it’s growth e.g. sleep, no stress, etc. Doctors are taught to patch problems, not treat the underlying cause. Pharmaceutical industry makes no money off Candida because the cure is eating healthy, so there is no incentive. The medical industry and big pharma are very tightly nit together. I went to an allergist, 3 medical doctors, a neurologist, etc. They all made remarks or suggestions for me to go on an SSRI. What the fuck? For my gas, the doctor wanted to put me on a proton pump inhibitor–last I knew, gas was caused from bacteria/yeast fermenting food in your stomach. Whats even more interesting is if you talk with these doctors, you’ll see large gaps in their knowledge. One doctor I talked to didn’t even know what serotonin was but was trying to prescribe me an SSRI because he thought I was simply just depressed. How can you prescribe something but not intimately know it’s effects? I digress… Microbials in the stomach play a huge part in your immune system from what I’ve researched. From reading National Institute of Health database studies, to various books on digestion, it is clear bacteria influence the immune system to an immense degree. How to put the thousands back into place, or know even IF they are gone, is the challenge. There is no way to tell what microbes were destroyed in your stomach and no way to know how to put them back. Some may have been lost forever according to various researchers. There are tons of pathogenic microbes, why Candida is the sole star here I’m not particular sure. Understand there are other things possibly going on. I started making kefir and so far I have not noticed a big difference in drinking it. I will continue to take it and see what happens. So far, nothing significant. This illness is manageable, but I’m not sure if it is curable. I have not found ANY testimonial of someone if SYSTEMIC candida, who was cured. Only people with minor symptoms like yeast infections, etc. They say food digests in the stomach for 4-7 hours however, if I eat fruit or drink milk I get gas within an hour or 2. So, I’m thinking something is going into the small intestine and something isn’t right there. I wonder if Candida is in the small intestine? Supposedly, not much bacteria there. Most gas is produced in the colon they say, but I get gass immediately after eating which tells me opposite of what my research says.   I have never experienced “Die-off” either. When drinking kefir, or taking probiotics, I never felt this die-off people talk about. I think this is more of something people with psoriasis or celiac disease experience from studies I read about. If your feeling like shit from something your doing, don’t discount that you might be doing something harmful to your body. Feeling terrible effects isn’t always “Die off”. TIPS When researching things, question all of it. Never take all this information as truth but also do not become so skeptical you’re becoming dogmatic and disbelieving everything just for the sake of doing so–you HAVE to take leaps of faith in some things. Candida is a perfect example. It’s not well researched by medical doctors–it’s researched very thoroughly by scientists, but not doctors. These two groups do not pass knowledge to each other. Scientist may discover something but the doctors don’t find out about this discovery till years later. Scientist are typically the investigators and the ones doing the deep research, while doctors are just the middle men who interpret this science to you. Scientist are lifetime researchers whereas many doctors learn what they needed to learn for Med school, then research doesn’t continue through out their life. I see this constantly. Like people their are proactive and initiative doctors. It’s trying to find them. So, some things you need to use your “faith” or intuition as to what is going on, and piece things together accordingly. All our bodies are different and we reaction differently, build anti-bodies to different things etc, but I find drinking milk and eating sugars causes the most problems for me. I found this out even before learning about Candida and the sugar connection. Make sure you log everything and keep a diary of everything. Research probiotics, candida, intestinal health, etc. using the NIH databases, reputable resources. LEARN GOOGLE SEARCH OPERATORS so you can filter bullshit guru sites that are out for making money, and create an exclusion list of things you know are bullshit. Sign up for consumer reports to find out what probiotics and supplements are tested to meet what the product is marketed as. Does it really have 80 billion CFU? etc. Understand nobody gives a shit about you if they are selling a “solution” to your candida issue for $1000. Probiotics cost unbelievable amounts of money. Find good sources and ones thoroughly researched. Connections I meet every symptom of HPA axis dysfunction (Hypothalamus/Pituitary/Adrenal Axis) which is one of those terms that makes your doctor cock his head with a puzzled look on his face. It’s not a medically studied topic, but I do believe it’s real. You’ll often have one of those chick-before-the-egg questions in your head when it comes to Candida–did my candida get caused by stress, or is candida causing my stress? Did my overactive adrenal glands happen from allergic reactions to food, or is this causing the allergic reactions? This is where a log or diary is essential. Stress seems to be directly linked with Candida for me. All these mystery symptoms flair up during stress. So there seems to be a connection. Stress apparently from what I read has a big influence on your microbes in your stomach. I don’t have a microscope and a $80,000 degree to verify this, but its a sound idea. Working out too hard seems to make me sick as well. If I workout a lot, I feel ill. I read somewhere that lots of physical exertion can cause leaky gut, allowing pathogenic microbes to get in. Recently, i’ve not worked out much. I’m trying to calm my body. Conclusion The last 6-7 months of really knowing I was ill has taught me a lot, especially from a psychological perspective. I don’t know if there is a cure, I don’t know of anyone with SYSTEMIC candida has been cured, I know there are TONS of scams, and I’m trying to wade through it all and filter it the best I can. There are no experts on the matter that I’ve come across except for very knowledge people. I don’t know anyone who has actually studied the microbe itself. At times I feel ok, I can actually feel alright, but much of the time I’m sick, and I feel very ill. Sleeping, eat GAPS diet, and avoiding stress seems to allow me to feel the closest to being well, but the slight deviation from this I’m very ill again. So, I can live a manageable life but I have to eliminate a lot of things from my previous life. I cannot drink anymore, I cannot go out to bars like I used to, I cannot eat ice cream cones with my daughter, I cannot eat pizza, etc. I can, but I pay for it. I’ve found that all this has strengthened something in me, but at the same time is making me very weak. It’s a strange paradox. It has changed my outlook on life. I’ve become so sick at times, I’ve prepared my life insurance papers in anticipation. Follow the GAPS diet, sleep well, avoid stress and you’ll be able to handle this. Do differently, you’re going to live in sheer hell."
1,goingnatural,168,"First, off welcome to the forum (or at least your first post). To be blunt with ya, I didn’t read everything you wrote, and I’m not sure what you are expecting in terms of a response. However, it is clear that you have given this a lot of thought. I know that you wonder if this is all real? I could quote you all the doctors, microbiologists, and scientists I’ve read; but I won’t. Just look around you. Obese, unhappy, tired, and generally sick people are EVERYWHERE. Almost every adult is popping a pill for some autoimmune and or chronic disease we have a name for. We daily consume chemicals created in a lab, eat sugar like it is an essential nutrient, and take antibiotics for everything. We have hundreds of trillions of bacterial cells in our body to 1 trillion human cells. The #1 visit to a doctor in america is for stomach issues. Surely, something has gone wrong. We left what was natural long ago. Our excess, what some call, “The King’s Diet”, coupled with westernized dogma — We know best — has created illnesses not seen 100 years ago. Give your body a chance, take out the bad, put in the good. It may take some time, after all you being sick didn’t happen overnight, but I promise you your body can heal. Who knows, you may be a “believer” in all of this yet …"
2,Maxtoobad,168,"I know that it is all real. My hunch is that there is a cure (haven’t seen much evidence) and that eating foods geared to thwarting this condition can heal your body however; nobody knows exactly what to do. We have good ideas, but nobody has found a surefire way to be healed of this particular problem. I never said there wasn’t a problem. I’m saying nobody knows how to systematically correct certain health problems. “Eat healthy” everyone says but everybody has a different need for their bodies or conditions. We cannot all eat apples and feel good. We cannot all be vegans and feel good. Different approaches are required for different conditions and problems. You are right that we need to take out the bad and put in the good. I’m sure over time–perhaps long periods of time, people can heal by eating good foods. It’s identifying however what are the good foods when you have a condition. Whole grain oats are healthy, but not for someone like me who gets reactions to them. Watermelons and cantaloupe are healthy foods, but not for me with my condition. Once again, it’s identifying what people need for their conditions. There is a balance somewhere, but it’s trying to find it."
3,Maxtoobad,168,Also I’m not promoting the GAPS diet over The Candida Diet; I’m for any diet that works. I came to this forum thinking it was “Candida Forum” only realizing later this forum is for The Candida Diet website which is a specific diet.
4,goingnatural,168,"It is true that many of us have different sensitivities to foods so in that sense, of course, there is no “one size fits all formula”. However, all of us, sticking to a whole foods based diet, void of chemicals and sugars over the long term will go far in giving the body the fuel to heal."
5,raster,168,"A lot of your symptoms are related to candida but not all are caused by candida. Some of your symptoms are caused by a damaged liver, lack of trace minerals, nutritional and vitamin deficiencies, too many toxins, etc. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6588_Many-of-your-symptoms-are-liver-symptoms.aspx Have you started to put together a plan on what you are going to do? Your post is very long and I didn’t go through it thoroughly because of its length. Are you posting this at multiple websites because it seems well prepared? Have you considered consulting a naturopathic doctor who can heal and treat you better than people on the internet? Here is dr. mcoombs candida symptoms list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6305_100-candida-symptoms-list.aspx -raster"
6,Maxtoobad,168,"Why would I post just because it’s well prepared? Odd response. I’m using the internet because like you, I’m looking for answers. Are you currently going to a naturopathic who has healed you?"
7,alexalgebra,168,"I actually read the majority of your post. I have a similar background to you – ate pretty healthy, but I used to party too hard years ago, and kind of replaced alcohol with junk food when I got sober, so I would try to balance out my junk food habit with organic salads or whatever :p Anyway, I’m one of those folks everyone would look at and say, “Oh Alex, you’re so healthy!” when I actually was really sick and just didn’t know why or with what. I had a lot of the same symptoms as you and others – fatigue, brain fog, irrational anxiety, irritability, digestive troubles, a lot of colds, etc. There are also others on the site that are “cured” or close to it – raster, dvjorge have both been at it for quite a long time, using different methods, and are both pretty recovered. Also, myself and shayfo, we both started this diet and protocol about 6 and a half months ago, and both of us are now starting to reintroduce foods and feeling pretty darn good. I, personally, just went on tour for a week and a half and am about to be gone for a month on tour again and then being a camp counselor for a week. I managed to stick pretty close to the diet, flubbed a little (on purpose and on accident, stupid hidden ingredients)…I had 2 bad days when I got home where I was definitely detoxing and recovering, but it’s now 5 days later and today I feel AMAZING! I even tested a new food (peapods) and am feeling dandy. This is a HUGE fucking deal, because in the end of March, I went to a local gaming convention and didn’t cheat or overdo it that much, but still ended up taking almost two months to recover. A four-day recovery time is a freaking miracle considering that I was still feeling like shit even back in May. The basic things that have gotten me through this are: 1. I truly, truly believe in my heart of hearts that being vegetarian has really helped cut my recovery time down from those who aren’t. Shayfo is also veg and has had the same timeline as me, more or less. 2. Working from home, trying to stay relaxed as much as possible and not freaking out when “life happens.” 3. Taking a vacation to my cousin’s place in LA this winter. I had a bad reaction one day while I was there, but being in the warmth and sun and forcing myself to take a week off of work was a really, really good idea. Staying with someone that let me use his kitchen was great, because I could stay on the diet but still kick back and hang out in the Cali sunshine 🙂 (Also, holy shit, the avocados down there are to die for!!) 4. Staying EXTREMELY STRICT with the diet!! I did not “cheat” or go off the diet at all until this past month, where I’ve fudged some things because of feeling pretty recovered and just to help make my life on the road a little easier. My fudges include one cup or less of coffee a day when I have to be up at ass o’clock and talking to screaming teenagers all day, carrots (no more than 1/day, usually more like 1/2 a day), tomatoes (maybe 1/2 every other day), and unsweetened hemp milk (goes in the coffee). Nothing too terrible. I ate one strawberry last week (bad idea) and accidentally ate something with sugar in it (bad idea, stupid hidden ingredients) :p 5. Yoga!! I can’t tell you how much one yoga class a week helps! I think two would be ideal but I can’t afford it. 6. Trying not to worry about how much I spend on food, and instead focus on how it really all evens out because I’m not spending that money on alcohol or eating out. 7. Keeping a positive attitude – EXTREMELY important! I have bad days still (last Thursday and Friday I was a fucking mess, trust me), but if I try to pull out of them as best as I can, my days feel great. Even when I was feeling more sick, just trying to focus on being best friends with my body and helping body fight this shit off would help me, and I think it really helped my healing. 8. Sleeping as much as necessary and not using an alarm clock. Basically, since I work from home, I can set my own schedule. So if I go to bed early and wake up at 9, cool, if I can’t sleep or don’t want to and stay up late, I can also start my day at 2 pm. It’s pretty awesome and liberating and definitely has helped speed up my healing. Those are the biggest things that helped me out. Good luck on your journey and feel free to message me with any questions or anything. Welcome to the forum!"
8,Maxtoobad,168,"Alex, I appreciate your reply. Unfortunately for me I’m under extreme stress most days albeit much of it can be controlled cognitively. Working a full-time job that is very mentally demanding then I have a second job I work on the weekends doing the complete opposite, no mental work instead heavy manual labor in a lumber yard for extra bills to pay off bills, etc. So I’ve got my fair share of stress which probably isn’t helping this newly acquired mystery illness. I’m glad to hear of all the success people are having here–particularly why stuck around because curezone.com for example was a bit of a joke and was full of very lost individuals. Here it’s nice to see that people are developing strategies, sharing information, and that’s important for something like this that has been disregarded by the medical doctors and the schools which train them. It’s interesting you mention yoga because when I became sick in January–or rather when it was at its pinnacle, I considered it to perhaps help me 1.) calm down 2.) stretch which engages your nervous system and can help refocus your mind. Instead, I went to a Chiropractor who did functional medicine that was going to pursue my illness I came to him for, but it was all too expensive, and instead I got a session of deep massage for my extreme tight muscles, and on my own accord followed the GAPS diet, was on L-glutamine for possible leaky gut healing, would drink whey protein shakes everyday–whey isolate with no lactose in it so they my brain was getting good amounts of amino acids for my body (l-typtophan for serotonin, l-tyrosine for dopamine, etc). I wanted to make sure I wasn’t shorting myself for mental health nutrition. Anyhow, in March 2013 I was feeling pretty good. I was doing the following:Wasn’t eating simple sugar products at allWas eating bone broths and soupsMade all my meals based on the GAPS, SCD, Candida Diet recipesEating lots of spinach, green leafy foods, etc.Stopped drinking my water from the tap and would drink distilled water so I wouldn’t start killing my good bacteria (or what was left of it)Was taking Ultra Flora 80billion cfuWas eating things to help prepare my gut-lining (whey protein, etc.)FORCING myself to go to bed early which is hard with my family and workReduced my second jobs hours to where I only work weekends (Before was working during the week after second job!Would try to do mindful type meditation, etc. I found it cheesy at first, but I had the epiphony that my mental health probably had more to do with this illness than anything else.Stopped going out on weekendsChanging the amount of food I ate in a sitting and how long I chewed my foodSat out in the sun for 30 minutes a day because my day job I see no sun at all. My Vitamin D levels had to have been extremely low When I got ill again, I was deviating ever so slightly back to more carbs–I would eat an entire bowl of kidney beans with olive oil, onions and garlic (taste great!), stopped probiotics because I wasn’t sure if they were doing anything and they were costing me a FORTUNE. I hate spending money on stuff that I cannot verify is working. I can say, out of all I listed above, something of them or them all combined, was doing something positive. The kidney beans to my surprise–thinking they were ok–had quite a bit of carbs. Certain things I thought were ok, were not (just now realizing this). One thing that really sucks for me is when I work my weekend job (Yes, I should quit it, but I got bills to pay till December) is when I do lots of physical labor, I start getting really dizzy on this diet and I need some source of energy. So I’ll eat kidney beans or something before this job. I have noticed one thing:Doing a lot of physical labor or the like, eating a carb meal (not simple sugar meal) before this doesn’t seem to spark Candida like symptoms. This is probably because your body is immediately using up all the energy before the Candida or whatever the fuck it is, to it first. And yes, staying positive is very important. I’m NOT depressed whatsoever but I frequently think about offing myself when I’m feeling sick for days on end. With an illness like this, you fall through the cracks with these medical doctors, they dismiss you, and you’re left to fend on your own and it’s insane. Then to add insult to injury, you scour the internet only to find scam after scam and pseudoscience after pseudoscience, egotistical asshole after egotistical asshole in forums. Gets discouraging. Anyone, I appreciate everyones contributions on this forum. It’s great to see all the minds working together on this problem, rather than everyone kind of fending on their own against this beast. I often wonder how many people kill themselves from this illness because they think what they are feeling is merely what the doctors tell them, “ahh, it’s normal, your hypochondriac” then live thinking that’s “normal” and then off themselves because of the PHYSICAL pain, not mental pain."
9,alexalgebra,168,"Yeah, man, I wish you could quit one of your jobs; I think it would really help you relax and feel better. The thing is, your body only has so much to work with, like so many resources, you know? And if you’re spending them on stuff like working, working out, extraneous activities, then they aren’t going towards healing and you will get really exhausted and not see as much of an improvement. I have basically had to think about my body as my best friend and treat it accordingly, you know? Would I beat up my best friend when she’s sick? Nope! Would I ask her what I could do to help or to take away extra stress or work so she could focus on getting better? Yep! Also, man, I can so relate about wanting to off yourself on bad days 🙁 I hate it, but that is the first place I go when I am having a bad day. It’s like…I can’t take it another second! But I have 95% good days and 5% bad days at this point, instead of the other way around, so I know it’s worth it to hang in there. Also, Curezone is scary as fuck. I was browsing once and read a story about a dude that “cured his Candida” by doing a 40-day URINE FAST. Yes, it’s exactly what it sounds like. :/ Oh, also, I can’t remember why and I’m actually on the clock right now so I don’t have time to look it up, but there’s some reason you shouldn’t drink too much distilled water. I would stick with something filtered, not distilled."
10,Smitty99,168,the symptoms I was reading that you were going through and the lifestyle of working out and being active sounds almost identical to my story. I now look at candida differently than when this all began. the years of eating sugary crap.foods and binge drinking on the weekends was like continuously adding gasoline to a giant pile of wood. no fire so no problem. everything seems ok. I mean I work out regularly and play sports so what’s the big deal? well that is until the match is lit and the years of gasoline gets ignited. in our case it was prolonged traumatic stress. this type of stress can literally stall your immune system and send your blood sugar up. candida spread like wildfire cuz of all the previous damage. you can’t even believe how sick you are when you’ve never had issues before. at least that’s how I felt. I’ve been battling since March and it all started for me.with a sore throat too. was prescribed antibiotics three times making my situation worse and worse. then came the food allergies which brought on the severe headaches. I never have headaches prior to this. then came sinus.pressure and ear infections. heart palpilations. intense anxiety and stress. you don’t have systemic candida. that’s an overused term. if you had that. candida would be in your blood stream attacking your vital organs and you’d be in a hospital.bed. that’s not tp say what we are goin through isn’t Damn serious cuz it is. the only way to beat this is with patience and knowledge. you need.to be way.more.strict with your diet cuz u are feeding the candida still. you should follow ables protocol. its outlined everything. it was developed by raster and able and they are the two most knowledgeable ppl on the forum but everyone here is great. your infection sounds quite serious so you should start as soon as possible. as raster would say. find yourself a naturopath with a background in candida. chances of finding a knowledgeable md on the subject. slim to none. sorry for the grammar. typed this via a phone lol
0,bouncygal,169,"Update Update!!! Its Bouncy again and i am one week into the actual diet after doing a 10 day cleanse! Yay!!! Been doing heaps of reading about candida, although i follow the website diet i did get Able to send me a link to his version of the diet which i found very informative. I took a few of things from his diet like ONLY EAT EGGPLANT once a week, and adding RHUBARB to my eat list was sooo exciting. I do eat BUCKWHEAT & QUINOA but only 3 times a week for one meal on the days i do. I eat nuts recomended on the website except for HAZELNUT because they seem too sweet and i’m likely to overeat them. Also i’m a vegetarian so nuts are my meat. Oooo and i just bought a yogurt maker today so i can go all HOMEMADE STYLE like Able recommended (when i go 2 weeks into the diet). Once every 10 days ill treat myself to a small TOMATO because the website said yes and ABLE said no, so i went for inbetween. P.s I quit smoking 3 days ago, didn’t want to mention i was a smoker, because i already know how bad it is, but i have a real determination to give this the best go i can,i figure if i put in 100% i will make the hard road shorter. I wish everybody strength through the journey back to better health. xxx bouncy"

0,alexalgebra,170,"Hey all! I have a day off, so I wanted to pop on and give a quick update. Things have been going pretty well, health-wise, on the road. I have had an AMAZING amount of energy – more than I can remember having in freaking years. My daily schedule is basically up by 7, be at the venue ready to set up by 9, work until 6…work meaning walking around in the hot sun all day with a smile on my face, waving a sign that says, “STOP HOMOPHOBIA! ASK ME HOW” and talking with teen music fans about ways that they can work for equality in their lives. Lets just say…it’s not easy work, or work for a slacker! Although I’m pretty beat at the end of each day, I feel like a few months ago, I would have been toast two hours in. My diet on the road has been basically the following: – avocados. LOTS OF AVOCADOS – my greek yogurt onion dip with raw veggies (mostly cukes, radishes, and celery, a little carrot and tomato, maybe 4 bites of carrot and 2 of tomato each day) – homemade granola, both savory and sweet…this has been my staple “bulk up” food to keep me going and give me energy throughout the day – organic dried olives for a quick snack (ingredients are only olives, olive oil, sea salt, and spices) – coffee with unsweetened hemp milk and 2 drops of stevia (I know, I know…I drink about half of a small each day to get going…not used to this early morning schedule!) – salad with 365 herbs de provence dressing I was doing really great, but two days ago, I kind of overdid it, energy-wise, then didn’t get enough sleep (I have trouble sleeping on the road :p) that night. Yesterday I was okay, but today it’s caught up to me. My digestion today has been pretty terrible, but I’m not really having any other symptoms. I also know that due to the nature of what I’m doing, I have definitely not been chewing my bites 30 times because I have to eat really fast, two bites here, two bites there, between kids coming to my table or me going out to talk to more people. I’m at my cousins for a couple of days for the shows in his area, so I got to cook last night and I’m going to cook again tonight – yay! I feel like it’s not necessary, just nice. Anyway, I’m still happy that I can prove that you CAN go on Warped Tour with candida and survive!! I am also quite pleased that my small “cheats” aren’t negatively affecting me (the coffee/hemp milk). The only reaction I’ve really had is earlier my cousin made me an egg for breakfast and said he used coconut oil, only to find out that he used coconut oil spray…with soy lecithin. Got some immediate itchy butthole from that >:( Going to take some extra antifungals and probiotics tonight and hopefully will be recovered by tomorrow! I hope everyone else is doing well and having a great summer! Tour is going so amazing! I never thought I would actually feel happy again and I am so glad that I have been sticking to the diet and protocol for the last six months. I miss talking with you all! <3 – Alex"

It’s not exactly “easy”, but at this point, I’m so used to it, that it’s kind of second nature. All the fried food they sell at the tour smells pretty good, but then I think about how it feels to eat hot greasy crap when you’re walking around in the hot sun all day and suddenly I’m pretty grateful for my cucumbers and salad…LOL! As long as I can get 7 hours of sleep and have my couple sips of coffee in the morning, I’m pretty much good to go all day and feeling pretty great. I guess it also helps that I’m doing what I love and there’s pretty much nowhere else I would rather be than in a horde of screaming teenagers, haha. The only thing that really sucked was I had an almost full quart-jar of granola that got dropped and broke yesterday 🙁 I’m going to attempt to make more tonight for my drive back to Portland on Monday :p"

4,bouncygal,170,Go Alex love reading your update. this forum is great!
5,alexalgebra,170,"Thanks bouncygal! Here’s my latest update: I mentioned some of this in another post, but basically, I’ve been home since late Wednesday night. I had a weird last couple of days…ended up hanging out with one of my musical heroes and sharing sleeping quarters with him…never thought I’d be wandering around in PJs and bedhead with this dude! It was way more awkward and way less cool than it sounds, though. Fourth wall broken, LOL. I had a LONG drive back solo – LA to Portland, via SF. I made a lot of stops so SF to PDX took me about 14 hours. I don’t like eating and driving so I pulled over quite a bit to eat snacks out of my trusty cooler. Yay! I cheated, for realsies, for the first time…I had a strawberry at a farmer’s market. It smelled so good, I couldn’t resist!! It was a bad idea :p Gave me a stomachache for about an hour. I also had an incident in LA where I bought something called ChiaPod, which I thought was free and clear of sugar, but it had sugar in a hidden ingredient (vanilla paste)!!! I ate about half of it before deciding it was a bad plan and tasted too good to be A-OK. Sigh. So by the time I got home, I was definitely feeling the cumulative effects of being on the road for 10 days, eating somewhat questionably, being off my schedule and routine, not sleeping enough, drinking coffee, and the stress of tour. Thursday and Friday I was a MESS. A MESS! It was bad. I was whiny, irritable, and depressed. Thursday, I made a huge mistake at work because I was super brain fogged, out of it, and tired. I think I took three naps, at least. I was definitely feeling the coffee detox, plus detox in general/tour hangover. Itchy butthole to the max. Friday, I had to go to an event for my organization, and I was NOT feeling it. I was grumpy and mostly sat by myself, even though I really shouldn’t have been doing that. I felt pretty terrible and was actually having some suicidal thoughts 🙁 It was pretty bad. I slept a ton Friday night though, and started to get back into my regular routine on Saturday, totally good by yesterday. Today, I feel great!! So basically, four day recovery time…NOT TOO SHABBY!!! Especially considering that back in March, doing less and not even cheating at a gaming convention set me back like almost two months :p I’m trying to take it as easy as I can this week to prepare for my next stint on the road. I leave Sunday for 2 and a half weeks out again, then I’m back for a day before I start training and then do a week as a camp counselor!! Crazy summer!"
0,SRQ,171,"Inspired by Chlofoso’s entries, I’ve decided to chronicle my long journey with candida and efforts toward restoring good health. About Me: Female, mid-40’s, college graduate, employed, 10-year breast cancer survivor, active, healthy (I never get sick) The Beginning: Looking back, the best I can determine, I’ve had candida symptoms for at least 15 years, primarily foggy brain. Current Odyssey: Almost 6 years ago, the wheels came off when I finished a 7-mile run training for my second half marathon. My body seized up and hasn’t been the same since. I could barely walk and immediately started physical therapy. With no improvement, I visited more than a dozen physicians and endured an array of tests and treatments including: x-rays, MRIs, cortisone shots, acupuncture, upper endoscopies, biopsy, colonoscopy, and food allergy tests. Nothing was ever found. No treatments ever worked. And, yet, I was living with chronic pain in my lower body (buttocks, hamstrings, calves). I could no longer run. And walking for exercise was nearly impossible. Each morning, I began stretching my legs while still in bed in order to be able to get up and face the day. (I still adhere to that daily regime.) After having several extreme reactions following meals (muscle aches, vomiting), I started to zero in on my diet as the cause (even though the reactions were years apart). So, 6 years ago I began taking things out of my diet. First, it was MSG, then gluten, caffeine, chocolate, dairy etc. (I stopped drinking soda cold turkey the day I was diagnosed with cancer 10 years ago.) Eventually, each item (except MSG) was reintroduced after its removal didn’t show any physical improvement. Suddenly, though, I started having reactions to many foods. I was chronically exhausted, losing weight and shedding a tremendous amount of hair. My job has been quite stressful the past 2.5 years, which has added to the fatigue. Five months ago (in March 2012), I received the results of a food sensitivity test. I was off the charts sensitive to most common foods including chicken, turkey, chocolate, dairy, caffeine….and the list went on and on and on. I was instructed to avoid foods that I had a low reaction to for one month; foods with a moderate/high reaction 3-6 months. (Six months will be at the end of September.) I could eat lots of fruit and it seemed wine was back in play. (I had gone well over a year without wine due to adverse effects on my body which can only be described as near paralysis the following day.) Optimistic this new diet was my cure, I jumped in cold turkey but quickly discovered I was reacting to some foods which were on my ‘okay list’. A dietician with the company which conducted the test suggested a probiotic and enzymes. I consulted with my physician’s assistant about a probiotic and she wanted a baseline of my digestive system first. She suggested I could have something called candida. She said it could take a year to treat, but they’ve had good results with other patients. I happily saved stool samples for 3 days knowing this test would be the one to lead me to an answer finally. Well, it did. It showed candida. Immediately, I was placed on an 80 billion probiotic (FloraMax) twice a day (early in the morning and just before bed), an enzyme to be taken without food three times a day (Interfase Plus by Klaire Labs), an enzyme to be taken immediately after eating three times a day (XymoZyme by Xymogen) and a prebiotic (Biotagen by Klaire Labs). Unfortunately, though, I wasn’t told to further modify my diet. I was eating a lot of fruit for breakfast and as snacks throughout the day. (It was on my ‘okay list’ and I figured it was healthy.) When I complained to my doctor and physician’s assistant that my tongue was burning chronically and I was still feeling sluggish, they explained it was the sugar in the fruit…that I should cut out bananas, cherries, and grapes. Feeling more and more restricted with my diet, and wanting to learn more about candida, I stumbled across this forum. That was approximately one month ago. The Diet – A Progression: 6-weeks ago I eliminated wine, which I was having once a week. (Beer and hard liquor have been out since Christmas 2011.) The following week, I cut out all fruit. That wasn’t easy the first couple of days. After learning more on the forum about sugar and carbs, I started the strict diet 4-weeks ago — with a significant modification. I eat fish or seafood every day. A handful of eggs just isn’t enough protein to get me through the day. If eating fish daily is setting back my recuperation period a bit, it’s worth it to me to have the energy to get through each day and ultimately conquer this beast known as candida. I’m interested in hearing feedback on this aspect of my diet. The first couple of weeks were unpleasant eating just fish/seafood and vegetables. I kept telling myself, though, that I needed to get into a routine and I could do it. Routine: I awake at 5:55 a.m. to take my first probiotic. Then, I drink a glass of warm water to kick start the digestive system. I brush my teeth and gargle with coconut oil for 15 minutes to try to help calm my tongue which chronically feels like it’s burned. I drink another glass of water with a heaping spoonful of flaxseed to help prevent constipation. Next, I begin cooking my fish and veggies for lunch. (Twice a month, I have to prepare both lunch and dinner because I work late, not getting home until 10 p.m.) Then, I shower (toward the end alternating between hot and cold water to help with kidney function). Then, it’s time for my first of 4 cups of nettle tea for the day (to help with kidney function) with a handful of vitamins, molybdenum and breakfast (either 2 soft boiled eggs, 2 poached eggs or a 2 egg omelette with onion, red pepper and fresh spinach). Every other day, after work, I go grocery shopping (fortunately, there’s a Whole Foods near work) for fresh vegetables (green beans, zucchini, spinach, kale, asparagus). My grocery bill has gone through the roof. I’m now spending $300-400/week just on (organic) groceries. Then, I wash the veggies, cook dinner, exfoliate my skin (to help release toxins) and soak in a hot tub for at least 15 minutes. Usually, by that time it’s bed time and time to get ready to do it all over again the next day. It seems my days are now consumed with work and my diet to the point that I’ve had to temporarily give up some of my favorite activities including photography which is upsetting. I really just want my old life back. Die Off: I believe I experienced die off within the first 2 weeks of the diet via extraordinary fatigue/pain and a faux cold in which I developed a sore throat and subsequently lost my voice for a week. Results: The first 2-3 weeks were especially difficult because I was adhering to the new stricter diet and yet I wasn’t yielding any results. But, suddenly, my foggy brain started to clear up. My vision, which oddly had become blurred when I was consuming so much fruit, returned to normal for the most part. Also, a planters wart which has been on the side of my big toe for several years virtually disappeared. (Attempts by a podiatrist years ago to remove it via freezing, burning etc. had failed.) Week #4 (this past week) was the best yet. I experienced three straight days of good energy, little pain, no brain fog and no blurry vision. I was getting excited I was on the right path! The diet certainly isn’t easy. But with measurable results, it’s worth it. Then I made a mistake….yesterday. Mistake: Dropping even more weight, I became very concerned about my rigid diet just before week #4. I had lost another 6 pounds since starting this new diet. I’m down to 108 lbs. and cannot lose any more weight. None of my clothes fit, which makes me feel awful much of the time. I contemplated adding millet back into my diet but decided to hold off until I consult with my physicians. (I have two appointments with two docs this coming week.) I eat oodles of avocados and put coconut oil on my food but I cannot stabilize my weight. In hopes of branching out my diet, I ate one apricot last week. I experienced a faint reaction. (My tongue burned slightly but I didn’t know if that was the result of the apricot or something known as Burning Tongue Syndrome.) So, I tried one more apricot two days later (yesterday). What a mistake! Within 10-15 minutes, my head started hurting, the brain fog rolled in and that familiar dull ache slowly encased my body to the point that I could hardly walk. To make matters worse, I downed two spoonfuls of coconut oil plain (without any food) which upset my stomach. I’m rallying today after a long massage first thing in the morning, a lengthy shower and an omelette with avocado and nettle tea. I think it’ll be at least another month before I try to reintroduce something. Adverse Effects: 1. Moody – my mood swings a lot with this diet. It’s very frustrating. One minute I’m fine, the next I’m angry and resentful that someone is eating ice cream or sipping a glass of wine. 2. Bloating – I’ve never experienced bloating like this before. My belly is continually distended and I’m constantly uncomfortable. I’ve been forced to eliminate or reduce foods known to cause bloating (e.g. broccoli and cauliflower). I enjoy oat bran with cinnamon in the morning but due to bloating I only eat that once a week now. Also, after enjoying large salads for lunch for one full week, those had to temporarily go. 3. Burning Tongue – My tongue continues to burn and I’m still uncertain if it’s due to the candida, questionable nutrition or Burning Tongue Syndrome for which there is no known cause or cure. Future Plans: I plan to stay the course for awhile and do my best to maintain or gain weight. I’m looking forward to my two doctors’ appointments this week to get a feel for what they think about my diet and plan. Toward the end of September, I plan to introduce kefir. I’m looking forward to that! I’ve already ordered the kit online. The following month, I’m going on vacation out of state and I’m a little concerned how I’ll manage my diet. I’m staying at a place with an onsite restaurant and they’ve said they can accommodate my needs which is very helpful and eases my mind a bit. Also, there are a couple of chain restaurants (Outback and Carrabba’s) which I can rely on for a basic salmon and salad meal without having any negative reactions. I’m cautiously optimistic (today…at this hour) that in one year my health will be much better. I’m thankful I found this forum and can hear how others are coping with candida. Very few people can identify with what we’re enduring."
1,SRQ,171,"WEEK 5: UPDATE Well, I’ve successfully made it to 5 weeks on the diet — wahoo! This was an interesting week with ups and downs including one very long work day, two doctor appointments, adding different items to my diet, and learning more about the effects of anti-fungals — all while preparing for Tropical Storm Isaac. First, the kefir… After learning more about the benefits of kefir, I decided to introduce it to my diet as soon as possible rather than waiting until September when I would hit the 6 month no-dairy mark. My kefir kit arrived Wednesday. After letting it ferment for 20 hours, I tried 3 small sips as advised by Able when introducing a new item into one’s diet. Wow…good thing I took Able’s advice! I reacted almost immediately with my tongue burning more than usual and a dull throbbing pain creeping up my neck and settling into the base of my skull. As you can imagine, I was really disappointed. Not only was I looking forward to some variety in my diet, but also the additional calories and probiotics. After a long walk, soaking in a hot tub and hearing from Raster that such reactions with kefir are fairly common, I felt better. I really hadn’t gone backwards. Everything was still status quo. I visited my general practitioner for the first time in nearly a year to give her an update on my situation — and it was a productive meeting. The last time we spoke I was seeking her input about seeing an alternative doctor. (She suggested I be slow and cautious with the approach and keep her updated.) For me, she’s great because she’s a very good listener, thoughtful and open minded. After explaining the candida diet situation, she readily admitted most Western doctors don’t subscribe to that line of thinking but she wanted to hear more. By the end, she was concerned about my various vitamin levels primarily vitamin C and B-12 and suggested I re-introduce those to my diet. I started immediately with 500 mg of vitamin C and by the next day bumped it up to 1,000 plus 500 mg B-12. She also wants me to have a full blood screen test to see how my levels are doing and she suggested my other other doc might want to add a few tests of his own. She also suggested I talk with a nutritionist she knows who has experience in dealing with candida diets. (I’m holding off on that for awhile.) Due to the extra omega3 nutrients, she likes that I’m taking flaxseed daily. I was concerned that flax was a potential problem for breast cancer survivors but she clarified that the amount ingested would have to be extremely high. My other doc (the one who finally discovered the candida and leaky gut) is almost the polar opposite. His bedside manner is minimal and I would have fired him a couple of times except that he has a really good assistant who recognizes his faults and makes up for them, plus a friend is also his patient and has had great success. The appointment went really well. She completely understands my food reactions and why. (She’s been treated for candida herself.) She and the doc are concerned about my continued weight loss, so they put me on a protein shake with oodles of vitamins twice a day, if my system can handle it. It’s definitely not in sync with the strict diet, since each shake has 19g carbs. But, at this point, I think the benefit of 500 extra calories/day takes priority. Thoughts? I’ve consumed 3 shakes since yesterday and I’m quite excited. They taste pretty good and I’ve felt really good hours afterward. I’ve only had a mild reaction (light foggy brain) — not bad enough to stop. I figure it’s probably from the stevia, which I’ve reacted to by itself. They encouraged me to continue using coconut oil and garlic as anti-fungals and they gave me two other herbal supplements (samento and banderol) to use in very low dosages and slowly increase. Plus, I added in something called GlutAloeMine, which is supposed to help grow the gastrointestinal mucous lining. Even with an incredibly small dosage, I reacted quite strongly to this product. (I felt like I had just slammed a glass of wine.) Again, it’s probably due to the stevia. I’m going to lower the dosage even further and see if my body can tolerate it. To determine how much progress we’re making, they’d like me to do another stool test in October (oooh, what fun!). That will mark 6 months since I’ve been on probiotics. Something definitely is changing for the better inside my body because I had a doozy of a workday Monday without a major setback. I worked 15.5 hours, which up until recently would have taken its toll on me with tremendous fatigue and incredibly sore muscles. I got 5 hours sleep and was back at work the next day fresh as a daisy. I also had a busy day yesterday preparing for TS Isaac and I had good energy to get through the afternoon after drinking my first protein shake. My biggest concern right now is my diet if I’m called into work for the storm. I have plenty of canned salmon and tuna on hand. I now have the protein shakes. I’m going to load up on avocados today and boil some eggs to bring in a cooler with my probiotics. I’m now taking so many supplements I might need to bring them in a separate suitcase. : ) If anyone has suggestions on what else I could eat away (from home without cooking facilities), I’d love to hear suggestions. I didn’t really make the connection about garlic being a strong anti-fungal until I experienced strong die off this past week. I ate one minced garlic clove with lunch and within an hour or so the brain fog rolled in, my eyes blurred to the point I thought I needed a new prescription. The symptoms lasted a couple of hours then disappeared. Good to know! That explains why a couple of weeks ago, I felt horrible after eating dinner which included garlic. I suspected it at the time and layed off the garlic. Now I know for sure. I’ll stick to just one garlic clove at home in a controlled environment for now. I’m taking 5 spoonfuls of coconut oil. Interestingly, I don’t experience die off from that. I prefer to put the oil on my veggies, but now that I’m taking so much it’s becoming difficult with the veggies getting overly saturated. I seem to be okay downing 3-4 spoonfuls right before oil pulling. How does everyone ingest coconut oil? My weight is still fluctuating. I was at 109 and dropped to 107. Now, I’m at 108. Much of it, I think, depends on bloating and BMs. Speaking of which, it seems my BMs are becoming more regular now that I’ve added 1,000 mg of vitamin C into my daily diet. The bloating continues, although not as much as the previous week since I’m cognizant about avoiding foods which cause me to bloat. Good news — the burning sensation on my tongue seems to be slowly clearing up. Very exciting! It’s probably 70-80% better. Instead of it being constantly painful all over my tongue, it’s now a dull burn toward the front only, which is a great relief. I don’t know if it’s the oil pulling, the probiotics or a combination, but it’s great! I can’t wait for it to completely disappear. My tongue has been burning, with no relief, for 7 straight weeks. I made kale chips last weekend from the recipe posted on the forum. They’re delicious! What a delightful surprise. Not only are they yummy, they provide that much needed ‘crunch’ we lack with foods on the diet. I must confess…I made more a few days later. They’ve become a terrific snack. When I feel up to it and when I have time, I take a walk after dinner. It seems to help settle my stomach. Also, ginger tea after dinner helps with that bloated feeling. The past 3 nights I’ve been woken up in the wee morning hours by pangs in my digestive system. I’m not sure what that’s all about. It’s not painful….just annoying because it’s waking me up. I’m getting into a good groove with my diet routine. Looking forward to making more progress! I’ll check in again next week."
2,SRQ,171,"WEEK #6: UPDATE TS Isaac came and went without any impact on me — except added stress, especially dealing with preps for my diet. But, at least, that was it, thank goodness! I received my blood work results and learned I have a thyroid issue. It’s very interesting. When I had the blood work done, my general practitioner ordered a regular thyroid test (TSH) plus a detailed test looking at thyroid hormones known as T3 and T4, which, apparently, most western doctors don’t acknowledge. The TSH test turned up normal. The detailed test indicated, though, my T3 and T4 are out of balance. Turns out an imbalance can cause the following symptoms: fatigue, muscle aches, hair loss etc. — many of the same symptoms as candida. It’s rather complex and I won’t claim to understand a lot about it, but there’s a book and website called ‘Stop the Thyroid Madness’, which has quite a bit of information about it, if you’d like to learn more. My doc has been studying about it and said she’s had good results placing patients on a thyroid medication. Some feel better within two weeks. So, I’m now taking a teensy, tiny thyroid pill first thing in the morning 30 minutes before all my supplements. (I’m now starting pill intake at 5:45 a.m. or earlier.) I’m starting on a low dosage and will bump it up in one week. I’ll see how I feel….and get re-tested in 8 weeks. I’m cautiously optimistic. It would be unbelievable if some of my problems were due to my thyroid, which I’ve been tested for many times (just not the detailed T3/T4 test). Over the past six years, I’ve gotten my hopes up so many times, I have to be cautious for my mental and emotional well being. The thyroid issue wouldn’t solve everything, because, of course, there’s still the candida….. Earlier in the week, I suffered a bad reaction to two herbal anti-fungals (Samento and Banderol) given to me by my other doc. That stuff is incredibly strong! I suspected as much because I was supposed to start with one drop of each in a small glass of water and work my way up to 15 drops. These are itty, bitty drops. I did one drop for 3 days and, for the most part, I seemed okay. Then, I bumped the dosage up to 2 drops each. Ugh! A couple of hours later, my energy suddenly was drained, my tongue was on fire, my muscles were so achey I felt as though I’d been beaten with a palm frond relentlessly and I had pressure under my ears. Definitely not fun. It’s been 6 days and my tongue hasn’t recovered. All the progress I reported last week with my tongue is gone. I’m so ready for my tongue to heal and return to normal. Having your tongue burn with pain 24 hours a day for 7 straight weeks is annoying, aggravating and disheartening. After doing some research online, I learned Samento and Banderol are from South America and primarily are used to treat Lyme Disease. Other people reported similar reactions and they thought it was die off. My condition is way too fragile to handle that kind of die off, if that’s what it is. I can’t help but wonder if those anti-fungals are just something my body doesn’t like and is responding that way. Anyway, I haven’t reintroduced the drops. I probably will attempt it again later this week with just one drop. I’m having some success introducing plain Greek yogurt into my diet. I’ve experienced some mild reactions, but nothing severe enough to make me stop. I’m being really careful with it, but it’s nice to have something new in my diet. The protein shakes are doing well for me calorie and weight-wise. I’m drinking two a day and the extra 460 calories and vitamins are beneficial. I gained 1/2 a pound since last week, so I’m up to 108.5 (although that extra weight very well could be due to bloating). The shakes are a drain on my wallet, though (in addition to the rest of the diet). They’re not any cheaper online at Amazon. According to the manufacturer’s website, I can order it directly from them with my doc’s approval, which I’m going to seek. I’ll take whatever price reduction I can get. I’m also looking to cut down on my trips to the doc’s office (which is way out of my way) to buy the stuff. We’ll see. One entire pantry shelf is now filled with pills and supplements for the diet. In three weeks I plan to reintroduce chicken. I’ve been off it since March when a food sensitivity test showed I had a moderate reaction to it. I now know that reaction was probably a symptom of my bad leaky gut. But, I figure I might as well wait out the full recommended six months before reintroducing it. Plus, I haven’t been in a hurry, considering Able’s comments that meat protein slows down the candida recovery. If the chicken reintroduction is successful, I’ll probably aim for having it once every two weeks at first. Anyone have any thoughts on that? The idea of having just a bit of chicken and yogurt in my diet is very exciting — at least it’s something to look forward with the diet. I’m trying to be patient with this diet. Everyone says recovery just takes time. But, overall, I’m feeling worse every day than I when I started the diet. From what I’ve read, that has a tendency of happening. But, I’m at the point now that I can’t sleep through the night due to waking up in chronic pain with my muscles and burning tongue. I’m ready to feel better — now! Looking forward to reporting improvement next week."
3,SRQ,171,"WEEK 6: UPDATE I just completed week 6! If you’re thinking, ‘That was her last post’, you’re right. I re-counted my weeks and, to my surprise, I was a week ahead of myself. (I suppose I could chalk that up to brain fog.) So, week #6 is now officially in the books. What a rough week physically and mentally. But, I’m pleased to report I’m feeling better. For well over a week, I experienced awful muscle aches throughout my body and the foggy brain returned. I wasn’t 100% sure whether it was die-off, and I was feeling so lousy I decided I needed to take action. So, I eliminated two items from my diet: protein shakes and GlutAloeMine. I really didn’t want to stop the shakes and lose the calories, but I couldn’t continue wondering if every time I drank one I was exacerbating my symptoms. After four days off the stuff, I’m feeling better. (For me, the 4-day mark is critical since that’s typically how long it takes from something to completely move through your digestive system.) So, the question is: was I reacting to the protein shakes? Or the GlutAloemine? Or was it just a really bad case of die-off? In a few days, I’ll reintroduce a protein shake by itself and assess. Right now, I suspect the GlutAloemine was making things worse. I also eliminated all anti-fungals for a couple of days to give my body a break. A couple of days after reintroducing coconut oil and garlic, I started feeling better. I’m not sure what to make of that. I think my body was absolutely overwhelmed and couldn’t expel the toxins fast enough. One other dietary note: I stopped the Greek yogurt. I was only eating a little bit as a test and figured why bother at this point when I’m still reacting to it, if only mildly. After being on the thyroid medication for one week, I’ve now increased the dosage to two itty bitty pills each morning. Within the next week is when I could start seeing improvement, according to my doctor. The day I increased the dosage is the day I started feeling better. Coincidence? I don’t know because it was also the 4-day mark with eliminating the protein shakes and GutAloeMine. So many variables! That’s yet another reason to reintroduce a protein shake soon and see what happens. I recently purchased a Brita water filter. Due to continually having to fill the pitcher to filter the tap water, I’ve realized I’m drinking more water than I ever thought (and, I used to think I drank a lot!) During my bad week last week, I was incredibly thirsty. Thirst would suddenly overwhelm me and I would guzzle 20 ounces of water and not feel quenched. I understand feeling thirsty can be part of die-off, so I’ve tried to look at it as a positive (that the toxins are leaving my body) as I continue to chug water. By the way, my digestive system/leaky gut is so bad right now it won’t even tolerate lemon in water at this point. A couple of weeks ago, I squeezed a slice into a tall glass and immediately had a reaction. Overall, I feel much better than last week’s post, thank goodness! My muscles still ache but not nearly as much. Now it’s a mild, tolerable ache. And, thankfully, my head is 90% cleared up today. My tongue is transitioning from a burning sensation to a feeling of very dry sandpaper, which I view as a good sign. Last week my tongue was burning so bad, I could hardly focus on anything. I still plan to stay the course. The die-off is brutal. But, during the very rare times when I experience moments of pure clarity (when I’m brain fog-free) and I remember how I used to feel years ago, I know this is the right course of action. I hope everyone is staying positive as best they can fighting their candida battle. Stay strong….keep the faith. Here’s to an even better week ahead!"
4,SRQ,171,"WEEK 7: UPDATE It was a fairly uneventful week…which is good in many respects. At this stage in the game, I’m not expecting to experience major improvements, so to have a week without any significant setbacks is a good week in my book. As planned, I reintroduced a protein shake this week and I reacted to it. The immediate reaction was fairly mild and was limited to increased tongue burning and a bit of blurry vision. The achey muscles set in the following day. That was enough information to tell me I need to stay away from the shakes while my body mends. Good to know. Also, I reintroduced the two strong anti-fungals, Samento and Banderol. The first day was okay with one drop. But, the next day with the same dosage I reacted. During my bad week 2-weeks ago, I eliminated all exercise (which for years has been restricted primarily to walking). I felt well enough this week to take a 3 and 2 mile walk at a very slow pace. For someone who used to be so active, it’s just nice to be outside. Good news regarding my weight: I believe I’ve finally stabilized! I’ve actually gained a couple of pounds from a low of 107. Now, I’m hovering at 109-110 (usually the upper end represents a lot of bloating). I’m learning to ignore the bloating. When I first started the diet, the sudden swelling and discomfort nearly sent me over the edge. Now, I just roll with it and know it’s just part of the candida and that some days/hours will be worse than others. I’ve even worked cauliflower back into my diet occassionally. Broccoli still creates incredible bloating. So, while I really like broccoli, I’m continuing to avoid it. Also, my hair loss seems to be improving — at least in the shower. I’ve always shed a lot of hair, but it increased tremendously as my candida condition worsened. Now, that I’ve been on the diet for 7 weeks, it seems to be lessening. I made a point over the past several days to monitor closely how much hair I cleaned out of the shower drain. It’s definitely decreased! If only my tongue would stop burning… I’m getting excited about my trip out of state to North Carolina next month and I’m feeling good about my ability to control my diet. I purchased a little portable water boiler, so I’ll be able to boil water for eggs, tea and oat bran. That will be perfect! It’s such a good feeling knowing I’ll be able to have my usual diet “comforts” while on the road. Having a routine really helps me stick to this diet. I’m hoping to test coconut bread within the next several weeks. If all goes well, I’ll be packing a couple of loaves for the road. Whenever I start to get down about this restricted diet and my continued muscle pain and burning tongue, I remind myself of my victories so far: * Brain fog – reduced significantly (almost gone) * Blurry vision – reduced significantly (almost gone) * Hair loss – reduced  * Planter’s wart – disappeared Here’s hoping everyone has a good week with their diet. To good health! See you next week."
5,SRQ,171,"WEEK #8: UPDATE Well, over the past week, my tongue transitioned from a burning sensation to one of a mild tingling. It sort of felt like I had just eaten something tangy. It was much better than the burning feeling and I viewed it as progress. And, then, I tried coconut bread again yesterday. All the progress with my tongue is gone. It’s burning as bad as ever. I’m very frustrated and disappointed. For two months, I’ve faithfully kept to this diet and still I cannot introduce any new foods. Up until yesterday, things were fine. I really felt like I was on the verge of my burning tongue disappearing for good. Now, who knows how long it will take to get back to that point. I’m feeling quite discouraged today. The emotional ups and downs of this diet are almost too much to bear. The only other thing I have to report is that my appetite has really spiked recently. I’m eating two large servings of oat bran every day now and loading up on even more veggies for lunch and dinner. (Think Thanksgiving dinner type plate packed with greens.) I was planning on reintroducing chicken and plain greek yogurt this coming week, but now I’m going to wait for my tongue to calm down. Hopefully, I’ll feel better within 3-4 days when the bread leaves my system. It’s just a matter of me enduring the discomfort and pain for now. Hope everyone’s making good progress with their diet. I look forward to telling you next week that I’m feeling better."
6,SRQ,171,"Week 9: Update It’s taken one week, but my tongue finally seems to have returned to how it was prior to eating the coconut bread. (I also ate some greek yogurt which may have delayed my recovery further.) I’m so concerned about experiencing another relapse, I don’t want to reintroduce any new foods until my tongue symptoms disappear 100%. The problem with that line of thinking, though, is that there’s still a chance I’m experienceing Burning Tongue Syndrome, for which there is no known cause or cure. It certainly seems to be connected to my digestive tract, though. Also, the end of the work week last week was quite stressful, which I’m sure exacerbated the burning sensation. I’m continuing to lose less hair, so that’s a bit of good news I can focus on right now. I’m still taking coconut oil and garlic most days as anti-fungals. My reaction isn’t nearly as profound as it was several weeks ago. Some days I don’t react at all, other days my head gets a bit foggy. It’s still easier for me to put the oil and garlic on food. I just don’t like the tast of the oil by itself. I worked my way up to 4 tablespoons last week. But, I’ve backed it down to 2 Tblsp. I’m interested in adding SF 722 or oregano oil, but, as I mentioned, I’m quite hesitant to add anything new to my diet. I haven’t wavered from my daily regime of micro-nutrients and vitamins. One thing I haven’t really mentioned before is my bowel movements. For years, I had little pellet poos, after having been extremely regular. The first several weeks on the diet I was very concerned about constipation and added flaxseed to help things along. That worked enough to keep me going daily, but the results…how shall I say….weren’t really substantial. Within the past several weeks, something has changed. I now have ginormous stools every day. At times, I wonder how in the heck that came out of me. I’m just happy to get it out of my system! And, on that note, I’ll leave you until next week. I’m looking forward to a calm week with no flair ups and less burning tongue. I hope everyone is sticking to their diet and remains optimistic about feeling better soon."
7,SRQ,171,"Week 10: Update Not much to report this week. The past couple of days, my lower back has been really hurting and I’ve been exhausted. I switched my probiotic from 50 billion to 80 billion during that time and I’m wondering if that’s why I’m not feeling well. Any thoughts? No significant change with my tongue. It’s still burning…sometimes more….sometimes less. Within the past two days, I’ve also periodically experienced an odd twinge under my tongue, almost like a cramped nerve. This is a brand new symptom and I don’t know what to make of it (if anything). I heard a really good message today from Joel Osteen, a popular evangelist. He was talking about how everything has it’s predetermined time by God. My body will be restored to a healthy condition again. I just have to be patient. So, know that I’m praying for God’s grace to be patient and accept his timing. See you next week!"
8,SRQ,171,"Week 11: Update Well, I endured another bad weekend. This one, though, was by far the worst since starting the diet. My entire body was in such horrible pain, especially my lower back, buttocks and legs. I just wanted to sleep, but I was in too much agony to sleep very much or very well. I did two things differently this weekend which may explain the sudden increased pain: (1) I was out of town and once again took a higher than normal probiotic dosage (80 billion vs. 50 billion) and (2) I introduced the forum’s pumpkin muffins into my diet. It’s fall and I just wanted a taste of pumpkin. Is that too much to ask?! Apparently so. After buying all the ingredients and making the muffins, I was excited to try one — they smelled delicious! Well, I ate just one-third of a small muffin and immediately knew it was a really bad idea. I was down for the count the entire next day. I’m feeling much better today but still a bit frayed at the edges. (And, this occurred while taking molybdenum. I can’t imagine the state I’d be in otherwise.) I saw my candida doc yesterday and he believes my system reacted negatively to switching from 50 to 80 billion and back again so quickly. So…I will not be doing that anymore. He also reassured me that a common complaint during the long healing process is lower back pain as the toxins leave the body. I’m going to do another stool test soon and will have the results back before Thanksgiving. Depending on the results, I might be able to start weening myself off some of the many supplements I’m taking, which according to my doc, will actually cause me to feel better. (Apparently, the digestive system doesn’t like the mishmash of all the probiotics and supplements required to eradicate the candida infestation. Thus, the bloating etc.) It’s nice to be reassured that feeling poorly is part of the process. I just need to find an acceptable balance of not feeling 100% but still being able to function and interact with people. My doc actually told me that those who say they’re feeling great after a few weeks on the candida diet probably are cheating. Lord knows, I have not cheated. Not once! And, I’m eagerly awaiting the big payout. I was reminded again that it takes time to clean out the candida — about 1 to 1.5 years. My eye is now on Christmas 2013. Speaking of holidays, I’m starting to contemplate my Thanksgiving menu already. Instead of turkey, I think I’m going to opt for a Thanksgiving bass. (This makes me laugh thinking of an episode from ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’) Then, I’ll load up on every imaginable fresh vegetable I can find: green beans, brussel sprouts, spinach, cauliflower, celery, and maybe even some olives. Dessert probably will be a few bites of plain Greek yogurt, which my system seems to be tolerating, as long as it’s just occasionally. It won’t be a traditional feast…nevertheless, it will be a perfect feast for my digestive system right now. Next week is my big trip out of state. It’s going to be odd being out of my comfort zone, but I think I’m as prepared as I’ll ever be. (I’m going to triple/quadruple check to make sure I don’t forget any supplements.) I’m going to boil lots of eggs for the road trip and cut up some celery sticks too. I’m also bringing a little water boiler for more eggs, oat bran and nettle tea. Lunch and dinner will be at restaurants which can accommodate special dietary needs. Wish me luck!"
9,Kris8,171,"HI, just a helpful tip for you. The lower back pain, buttocks, and legs is caused by blockages in your kidney and bladder energies. Your kidneys are being overworked processing all the toxins and it is causing excess energy to build up. The good news is you can release that pain fairly quickly by holding a few acupuncture points. I have fuond energy medicine to be an invaluable tool in healing. Everything is energy and the good thing is that if you know how to move that energy you dont have to feel so much pain! here is a link to innersource.net Donna Edens site (famous for her energy medicine). Hold the sedating points not the strengthening to release the blocked energy. Hold the points labeled 1st at the same time for 3 mins., then hold the points labeled 2nd at the same time for 2 mins. Try doing this throughout the day. I find it helps immediatly. What your eating is not necessarily causing the pain, the energy is! It changes from day to day from moment to moment. http://www.theinnersourcestore.com/kidney-meridian/"
10,SRQ,171,"Week 14: Update Well, I did it! I survived my vacation away from my very controlled eating environment. Overall, it went fairly well…but, I had about 1.5 days when I felt pretty bad. The worst things about travelling: (1) constantly wondering where I was going to get my next safe meal; (2) lack of readily available snacks; (3) watching other tourists enjoying the must-see, must-do, must eat things which I cannot enjoy. (It’s one thing to block it out at home. For me, it reached a whole different intolerable level being on vacation watching people gorge themselves with carmel covered apples, ice cream, beer, pizza etc.) In an earlier post, I mentioned I felt good about my travels because I could count on chain restaurants like Carraba’s and Outback. That’s an understatement! After paying $$$ and being served an itty bitty serving of plain food during my first night in Blowing Rock, NC at a restaurant which I had enjoyed in my pre-candida days, I knew I needed to seek better options. Fortunately, there was an Outback in town. And, fortunately, my travel companion didn’t mind missing the ‘must-do’ restaurants. Outback has excellent customer service when it comes to special dietary needs. And, their food is consistently good with decent sized portions. Breakfast each day was great. The inn where I was staying was really accommodating and made four plain poached eggs, a heaping pile of fresh spinach, Bob’s Red Mill oat bran and a cup of nettle tea for me every morning. Plus, I had avocados which I had brought with me. It was perfect! They also were happy to make hard boiled eggs for me for the day. I did some hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains and one day ended up eating hard boiled eggs and two cans of wild salmon for my lunch while on the trail. (Gone are the days of trail mix…bananas…and a sandwich.) I had so much fun on the hike, though, that I didn’t mind my less than appealing meal while my friend devoured a big ham sandwich. That particular trail I’ve hiked before. It’s quite strenuous and I wasn’t sure if I could do it again. Emotionally, I felt fantastic finishing the climb. What a great psychological boost knowing that I could do that once again! But, physically, I paid the price for about a week. Snacks definitely were a problem on the trip. As you know, there just aren’t very many options. So, against my better judgment I ate a few raw cashews during the long road trip, which naturally led to a few more, and a few more. And, well, you get the picture. Ultimately, I over did it and did not feel well. I think my body can only handle raw cashews in moderation. My bad days on vacation really were a product of my environment and lack of appropriate food. I took a road trip to the Biltmore Estate and figured I’d be able to find a plain salad with olive oil without a problem. Well, it was a problem. After a long drive and touring, I was exhausted and just couldn’t find what I needed. My friend ultimately got some spinach greens from a vendor and some olive oil and I ate that with some hard boiled eggs I had brought with me. Definitely, a memorable meal only in that it wasn’t a good experience. That was a rough patch during the trip. Somehow, though, I rallied for a big hike the next day. The other rough time was in Savannah, Georgia, where we stopped along the way to and from NC. On the return trip, I ran out of Bob’s Red Mill oat bran, which I’d previously made in the hotel microwave without any problem. So, I ventured to a popular local breakfast establishment. I ordered several poached eggs and spinach and gave my usual explanation about my dietary needs. As soon as I bit into one of the eggs, I knew there was a problem. I think some restaurants must use Pam or something when making eggs. Whatever it is, my tongue doesn’t like it and immediately started burning, which, unfortunately, put me in a foul mood as I sat watching people stuff themselves with every kind of breakfast food you can imagine. And, I couldn’t even eat an egg without a problem. Hopefully, the next time I go out of town for any length of time I won’t have such a restrictive diet. But, if I do, this trip helped me figure out how to be better prepared for my eating needs. Gosh, I don’t know what I’d do if I traveled with someone who wasn’t so understanding. I’m very blessed. When I returned home, I took a blood test for my thyroid. Soon I’ll know if that’s improving. Honestly, I haven’t felt any different taking the thyroid pills for the past two months. Also, I took another stool test to see if there’s been any improvement with my candida growth. **fingers crossed**  Most people on the forum talk about feeling better after a few months on the diet. I’m not experiencing that and I’m wondering why. Hopefully, improvement is right around the corner. Hope everyone has been doing well on their diets!"
11,Thomas,171,"Thanks for you wonderful posts. I am following them. Please check if you can get a breath test done. If you have high levels of Methane or Hydrogen gas that would show that you not only have Candida but too suffer from bacterial overgrowth. A lot of your sympthoms are that of endotoxins playing harvoc with your system.Hightend levels of endotoxins might just exceed the livers detoxifying capacity and spill over into the bloodstrea to cause systemic hyperalgesia. Therefore you pains in the body. Brain fog which is longer than you die-off time max 5 weeks is a good indicator for SIBO. Bloating, distension and flatulence are too strong indicators for bacterial fermentations in your small intestines. Especially when you wake up in the morning with a flat stomach and over the day you get round and bloated. If you consider getting the breath test, please dont buy a home kit as the test have to be done at a doctors place and take several hours find a medical practitioner who uses a gas chromatograph from the company QuinTron SC which tests both Methane AND Hydrogen. You can get the info which doctor has this maschine from the company. Phone 800-542-4448 or their Website: http://www.quintron-usa.com If you are afraid loosing more weight and cant stomach your protein drinks anymore try Vivonex which is pre-digested and gives your body what it needs. You actually can live from that stuff only if it would not be so expensive. all the best to you Thomas"

Oh, I am happy to hear that I was worth a thought for you! 🙂 I did what I planned and I am still in the battle. I was so dam tired of not knowing what the sympthoms are, die-off, etc. I got lots of test done, fighting for every inch to get them but it looks more and more that I am SIBO. I have still a ELISA test coming next week to check for food intolerances. I still not discounting the possibility of candida lurking its ugly head and will see about thatlater. What I learned is that: Low fibre eating make the world for me! That sugars are not sugars and how they affect the my intestines. That mucus production from my intestines to protect my lining seperates the food from the enzymes and will be eaten by the bacteria. The new plan of action for me is to get the food absorbed very fast in the first 2 feet of the small intestines.  I learned that there is no good bacteria or bad one but where they are will make the world. I felt terrible with pro-biotics and pre-biotics because they where counterproductive for me suffering already from too much gas and endotoxins. (to much bacteria) With all the knowleadge gain in the last month I feel 80 percent better but I am not healed and very senisitive. I too tried my own kefir and felt being see-sick in a wink.  My problem too is that I get very quickly sick like being see-sick and brain-fog if I even eat right but too much. Now I stopp eating every day around 20:00 hours and have a natural fasting until next day 8:00. I eat much less and plan with a nutrionist to figure the lowest amount of food for me which is healthy. When I had my total breakdown last year october I had no idea what hit me. Today I know it was a ketoacidosis where my liver could not handle anymore the amount of D-Lactic acid and endotoxins swamming my system. I suffered a mild form of metabolic acidosis. I say mild because it can be fatal, but it was not mild for me it was in fact so terrible that I never want to experience it again. Therefore I take it easy now with the killing of bacteria, fungus or changing diets. 😉 Slowly is better! Too much toxins which the liver cant handle can kill you. thats all I learned the last year and I am still fighting on hill upwards! I hope you guys are doing fine! How are you? yours all  Thomas"

Thanks for posting your regimen. Just to let you know; you really don’t have to do a long cleanse, in the end, three or four days more for a cleanse isn’t going to make a bit of difference to the outcome of your treatment. In fact, there are several ‘experts’ including myself who didn’t bother with a cleanse at all, but started directly with the strict diet and the protocol, and yet we still made amazing progress. My advice would be to stop the cleanse and go ahead with the protocol and strict diet if you have it in order to build your strength back and get more protein in you. Remember, “More isin’t always better.” Able"
2,bouncygal,172,"Thanks for posting Able, i have only just logged on and seen your message, now im four days into the actual diet. It would have been nice to not go for the whole 10days, as it really impacted on my abillity to do much (took some time off work). But the up side is i really appreciate the candida diet foods compairing with the cleanse."
0,alexalgebra,173,"I’m heading towards my six month mark, yay! I have realized some little things that were candida-related, that I didn’t even realize I had, now that they have gone away. First, my nose would often smell like ACV inside, and occasionally, my boogers would be white (sorry, I know that’s gross). I didn’t even realize that I had candida inside of my sinuses!! I would also get white earwax sometimes. Luckily, now that I realized that was candida, it has all disappeared 😀 I’m still having trouble getting my digestion to chill out, but it’s slowly getting better. Kind of a two steps forward, one step back. I accidentally ate some moldy (homemade buckwheat) bread this week, which definitely set me back, but not as bad as accidents have in the past! (PS Moldy bread is gross and I really don’t recommend it, LOL) I’m just having some stupid digestive issues over it, alternating soft stools and constipation for a couple of days, and one night of major stomach pain and nausea, but hopefully it will be gone by tomorrow, fingers crossed. Another update – I am about to embark on a two-month journey! I will be on tour with Warped Tour for a couple of weeks, home for a week, then back on the road for a few weeks, then off to be a camp counselor!! I have a basic plan for the road, which involves a lot of raw veggies, salad, avocados, hemp seeds, homemade granola, and yogurt…not entirely different from how I eat at home, honestly, except less eggs and less cooked veggies. Luckily I can digest salad and raw veggies these days!! I have been feeling pretty great and almost entirely symptom-free, aside from this mold incident (and a little bit of white on my tongue still), so I have tested out two foods that I believe will make my life easier on the road: carrots and tomatoes. I had one small carrot over the course of three days last week, with no problems at all. Today, I tried two bites of a tomato for the first time. I’m just looking for foods that will be simple for me to eat on the road, so I’m hoping it will be okay for me to add a few bites of carrot or tomato to my salads a couple of times a week, just for some variety of nutrients, etc. I also have had a small amount of coffee a few times, with minimal problems. I had a little itchy butthole happen after I had a full cup two days in a row, so I will refrain from drinking it too often, but it’s nice to have the option. The weird thing was, the caffeine didn’t affect me negatively at all! It just gently helped me focus. In the past, it would make me really wild. I feel like this means I’m truly ADD, and that my difficulty with concentration is not candida-related. So since I’m going to be gone, I won’t be posting much from here on out, at least until I return in August! I’ll pop in from time to time, I’m sure. If you want to keep in touch better, just message me for my email or facebook, which I will have access to more easily on my phone while I’m on the road. I hope everyone has an amazing summer!!! Thank you so much for all of your support over the past six months!!"

0,stovariste,174,"hi, I am not updating my status normally like others (I am not selfish, I was just not good enough and was mainly depressed), so I will do it shortly now. I am on strict diet for 6 months, but I got forums diet beginning of the January and before that I was on websites diet with nuts and red meat. I am feeling very well, with only few symptoms remaining (sometimes bloating, some mouth thrush and sometimes loose stool, but its getting more rarely imho). My only problem is die-off, but…  I finally managed to increase amount of antifungals with VCO, somehow I was stupid and wanted to do it ASAP. Then I finally read this post here. Before reading this properly my main problem was die-off, since I was always taking big shots right away without proper dosage increment. Then I started with VCO like Able described in given link, and I was really good increasing it up to 10+ tsp and moving back to 6-7 tsp when harder die-off comes.  I take 3 tsp before work in the morning, and I somehow experience some short die-off after some time. Then I take another 3 on work, and another 3 after work and just 1-2 before bed, since if I would put too much before sleep I would feel like a crap in the morning :). hopefully, I will soon reach some stage where I have zero die-off and be symptom free. I want to use this post to thank Able and Raster for all those informations on forum, really great work. Thanks guys!! I have problem though, here. please advice 🙁"
1,stovariste,174,"while I am sick in bad I have time to write more about my status :). I did not mention supplements. Probiotics: I am using this one in capsules form. This one was only I could get delivered without refrigeration, and to be strong enough (CFU) and to contain this DDS-1 like Able described in his posts. Also daily routine is home-made Kefir, which I drink up to 1 liter, but normally its between 0.5 and 1 liter. Prebiotics: hmm I am not using any supplement here, except the food from strict diet itself. Please advice is it ok like this? Antifungals: I’ve tried different things, but VCO I find the best, and I am sticking to it currently. Vitamins: Well, I bought almost everything which able recommended for europe deliver from iHerb web-site, such as Ashwagandha, Vit E, A+D3, Calcium+zinc… I also bought Swedish bitters but I did not give it a try yet… hmm, should I? Die-Off: Moly, milk thistle, Nettle leaf tee and lemon juice. Especially a lot of lemon juice up to litter daily 🙂 that’s about it"
2,Prizma,174,Good to read about improvmenets ! What is VCO ?
3,stovariste,174,VCO => Virgin coconut oil GSE => Grapefruit seed extract you will see more of these on forum 🙂
4,Prizma,174,"Thank you, Stovariste. Today I bought and already started.  I don’t like it at all. Immediately after I take a teaspoon, I need to take lemon juice or cucumber, otherwise I get sick of it. How long have you been beating intestinal Candida? /Hope this is not an unsuitable question/."
5,stovariste,174,"hi Prizma, I was having abdominal pain beginning of 2011. (the place where Liver is placed – Upper right side) and doctor advised me its nothing after they made several tests. They said its probably some kick I got recently and will go away just like it showed up. Next few months Pain started to move on left side, on right-down side, on left-down side (it is the path where colon is placed in body), and I realized that my stool changed and after google these symptoms first search results were Colon Cancer, and I was scared to death, and my state was gone even worse – I got diarrhea… I am writing you all these since I know your story…. I continue… Doctors assured me I have no cancer since my basic blood tests were absolutely great… But I never accepted their results and continue to fear 🙂 (sounds familiar?) IBS was main symptom, and doctors “diagnosed” me IBS like September 2011 I think. They just took my blood results, seeing they are fine so they said “you are young, trying to make things in life, you have family… “, and there it was I accepted it, even I had not similar IBS symptoms like written on internet, I was not nervous at all. My IBS symptoms were a lot of loose stools, like 2-3 daily, abdominal pain and more… But, during time I was getting worse and worse, normally I was eating everything and feeding Candida even more. Sometimes May 2012 somehow I figured out that it is Candida that I have and after google Candida symptoms I saw IBS is the first symptom, then I figured out what was it all the time. Then I started my treatment with some kind of diet, but I had terrible reactions to medicines and I did not know why (Later on I figured out that its die-off, I probably had some extreme numbers of candida in my guts)… I stopped the medics and I went the wrong road a few months, until I found this website in November 2012 when I started web-site diet. Later on in January I met people on forum, and here I am … hope it helps"
6,Prizma,174,"Yes, it does help. A lot !"
0,beachie94,175,"i have had constants vaginal thrush for about 3 years now, and i have decided enough is enough and i need it gone asap!. i have no idea how it started.. but it did, I’m putting it down to my sugary diet. I have tried over the counter medications, both the pills and the depositories – both which showed promising results for about a week but then the thrush came back again. After a while of this i decided to go see the doctor.. she then prescribed me the same medication, and told me to keep taking it until it went away fully.. i continued to take this for 2 months with no result.. as the medication is quite expensive i had to stop and moved onto natural remedies. I started with the yoghurt depositres, then onto the apple cider vinegar douches and then lastly onto the garlic remedy! nothing really worked for me. Thrush is ruining my life, my sex life and the constant ache and pain in my area is terrible!! always inflamed and red  I’m on the verge of a breakdown now as I’m feeling like theres nothing else to do! although it is great to see that there are tonnes of other women who are suffering from all kinds of candida, i feel this is a great site and am excited to start this diet and rid candida!!!"
1,Leeanne,175,Hi beachie94 I remember when I was on birth control pills I had rampant thrush. I stopped taking in 2008 and have hardly had it since. Could it be The pill?
2,ms81,175,"This is a part of Candida, some of us can get it to go away only to come back. It can be your diet as well."
0,aga,176,"Hi there, I will try to give you my story as short as possible. I am not an English native speaker by the way. I am 32 and I am a woman. I have two young children. One is two the other one is 9 months old. First time I got thrush in college, I was twenty something by then, it was rather mild. I did not have any white discharge and doctors (it was more than 10 years ago) were not sure that it was thrush because of lack of discharge. But they gave me some antifungals and I was fine for around 8 years. After that I started to have it again. I was using clotrimazolum cream and tablets for thrush that you put inside and also some tablets that you swallow. I remember using also Spilanthes by A. Vogel. I was fine after that. As I said I have two very small children. I got third degree tear with the second baby and I had to have an operation. I was on antibiotics after that to avoid infection. I am not sure how long it was but I think it was for 21 days. I was breasfeeding so they gave me something that was not supose to affect the baby (yeah right), unfortunately I do not remember what it was. Along with the antibiotic I did not get any protection, any good bacteria. I was afraid that I will have some stomach pains after them as I usully have when I am on antibiotics, but I was fine. After taking them I started to eat some good bacteria tablets called afterbiotic, but I eat only one packet. There is only 10 tablets in it. When I came home from hospital I noticed small red spots on my bottom, only on one side. I thought it was nothing so I started to put a nappy cream – Sudocrem on it. After a while the ‘thing’ spread and appeard on the other side of the bottom. It was not itchy, but red for a long time. Some of it looked like a ringworm, some like psoriasis. I went to doctor and he said it is a fungus, but did not say what type and he gave me Daktarin cream (with steroid). I did not want any oral treatment because I was breasfeeding. I used one packet but it did not do much. The skin got very dry and started to be itchy after that. Then I decided to use some natural remedies. I bought Acidophilus (in billions), coconut oil, black seed oil, oregano oil, tea tree oil, grapefruit seed extract, aloe vera, Spilathes, I was eating raw garlic for a while as well. I was putting all of them externally on affected skin and taking them internally (apart from tea tree oil :)). I forgot to mention that in the meantime I got thrush back and for the first time oral thrush as well :). I started to read about diet. I quit eating sugar, coffee, fruits, some vegetables, pasta, bread, rice, milk and other dairy products, especially chessee. As you all probably know it is hard to keep diet like that and sometimes I eat some of these things. I have to say that when I am on a very stict diet the thrush goes away, but the red patches on my skin stay the same. As there is not much information on the internet about candida skin infection I am not sure if what I have is caused by candida. But after taking natural remedies and having no effect I decided to go to dermatologist. He was not sure what it was, he said it is rather not psoriasis, even though when you look at it first it looks like it and not a ring worm. He gave me prescription for dovobet and dovonex, but I have read opinions about them on the net and I am afraid to start to use them. I just do not want to use steroids. I was wondering what was the reason I got thrush and the skin infection and I’d say my immune system after pregnancy is very very weak, the fact of being pregnant twice in such a short time span, having to look after two very small babies (it is really really hard and causes a lot of stress, especially when partner does not do much to help), stress caused by the problems in my relationship, being on antibiotics, eating quite a lot of sweets (I am not overweight though). I wonder if any of you have skin infection like me. I did not find anything on this forum about candida on the skin. I am going to send pictures of it in the next post. Another thing I wanted to mention is that I did not get any blood tests and any other tests done yet. But I am going to do some to make sure that what I have is not caused by some more serious condition. Doctors I was seeing did not say that I should have some tests to be done. I think that’s all I wanted to write. I am going to stay on this forum, and the web page for a while and stick to the diet. Thanks for reading."
1,shayfo,176,A friend of mine who treated herself for candida a few years ago had dermatitis on her butt as one of her symptoms — basically adult diaper rash. Could it be that? Or tinea versicolor? (Google photos of it.)
2,aga,176,"thanks shayfo, I’ll look at that"
3,hope4eva77,176,your rash is caused by candida. pregnancy is a great environment for yeast and having two pregnancies so close together is really bad for candida . I have had rashes on my thigh and butt area that were very painful all when i was 1st finding out about overgrowth like yourself i treated it with diaper cream and it did nothing .i then went to ob and they cultured yeast on my skin with a basic scrap test .it cleared up with nystatin and i havent had since .i still have other symptoms though .
4,aga,176,"hope4eva77, thank you for your post, I will have to try nystatin so, I have it for 8 months now and I am so tired of it; my rash is also on my thigh and butt; below are the pictures  "
5,hope4eva77,176,"yes that is exactly similar to what mine looked like and as it healed it turned a lil purple ,put nystatin and coconut oil on it and switch back and forth between them every few days or so . Put ice packs on it ,soak in baking soda or epsom salt baths ,let it air as much as u can . It should clear up on the protocol and doing the nystatin/cocnut oil in a wk or 2 .I hope !mine took 2 wks to clear ."
6,aga,176,"As I mentioned in my first post, I have two small babies and very little time to do anything for myself, that’s why I did not answer earlier. Thanks again for all your advice."
0,Donna V,177,"Hello Everyone, I am 56 years old and live in Alaska. I never understood Candida and people’s problems with it until I was given a package of Wisconsin cheeses—I ate some for breakfast, lunch and dinner! Everything in moderation–I didn’t. I now know that I have always had Candida. (I had a white tongue that no matter how I scrubbed wouldn’t go away. Doctors didn’t care about it.) Three years ago my 12 year old daughter moved in with her Heavenly Parents after battling a rare cancer for two years. During that time and for the year afterwards, I gained a lot of weight and ate all kinds of “comfort” foods, especially my favorite, ice cream. In the fall of 2011, I decided it was time to focus on me and regain my healthy self as I was 205 pounds and climbing. I am 5’7″. I stopped all sugars, grains and starchy carbs. I went on a high fat, medium protein and low carb diet. I know what makes my blood glucose skyrocket and what doesn’t. I’ve lost 50 pounds and have kept it off. I know it will take a while to regain my metabolic health; I’m patient. Cancer taught me that. I should point out that I had cut out all dairy including my kefir cheese and flax oil as all the doctors said that was not good, which didn’t make any sense as they suggested I eat plain yogurt. I KNOW what is in my kefir cheese! I had already been eating coconut oil; so I continued that. I do not eat breads even buckwheat or sourdough, rice or potatoes. I drink lots of water and an occasional herbal tea with a black tea if I am stressed, which is no longer very often. I use EFT if I need to. I have a rare cup of Mexican coffee if I have a headache that Exederin won’t touch as it staves off migraines for me. I don’t like coffee, so I add a tablespoon of whipping cream. I use Sweet Leaf Stevia or Xylitol for sweetening, but don’t really crave sweets anymore. I make a coconut oil, coconut (unsweetened) and cocoa mixture that I use as my dessert when I need a treat. In January 2013, I visited my sister in New Mexico who had been fighting Candida for 1 1/2 years. She was drinking molasses and baking soda daily. I had read something negative about this, but didn’t remmember what; so I didn’t want to do that. I started with a Candida cleanse that her health store offered for $27 and I liked other products from the company as they were all herbs. (My Alaskan health food store only sold products for $83 from a very good company.) I didn’t really feel any different after following the directions. I called the company and they told me I needed another round with additional products such as probiotics. I followed their suggestions and still didn’t feel any differently. I added L-glutamine and Pau D’Arco tea as I read that that helps combat Candida. My naturopath gave me Diflucan; that helped. I had to use it for a month, and my tongue became pink. I ate 1.5 oz of potato at a special dinner. Bloating occurred and I knew I had just caused it to be full-blown again. I paid for the Nature’s Sunshine cleanse at $83! No difference! I called the company and followed their additional product recommendations. I learned I was doing the probiotics incorrectly. The bottle said with meals–I was supposed to do it between meals! So I started taking them at 5AM before my 8AM breakfast and when I went to bed. I have used the Nature’s Sunshine product three times. No difference. Two months ago, I learned about DoTerra essential oils and started their Candida protocal, which was really a GI tract cleanser followed by probiotics. That was for 15 days. I then started taking the following essential oils 5 drops each: oregano, melaleuka, and lemon. I added Dr. Christopher’s Cayenne pepper of 5 drops. I added these with the last box of the NS cleanse. I returned to my naturopath who gave me a stronger dose of Diflucan along with Nystatin. My tongue is whiter than when I went to see her! A few days ago, my kidneys started hurting. I use a hot compress and rosemary essential oil. I reduced my supplements, stopped the essential oils, and stopped drinking the Pau D’Arco tea. (Boy, is that nasty stuff!) I have only slight right kidney pain now. I am grateful to have come upon this group. Thank you for any help you have. I have read a number of people’s posts but have not learned really what to do differently. I do not know how to request the strict diet as I am new to forums of this style. Thank you for your assistance. Donna in Alaska"

2,shayfo,177,"Hey Donna, welcome. If you’d like to read up on the protocol most forum members are following, you can find it here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx To get the strict diet list that’s to be used in conjunction with the protocol, send a private message to Able900. You’ll find a “PM” button under his post on the protocol thread to send a message. It sounds like you’ve got a good mindset and clear head for this! I wish you luck."
3,raster,177,"Hello Donna, First of all, I wouldn’t focus on the cleanses anymore because obviously they don’t do much in regards to the candida numbers. I would consider a liver cleanse because the liver effects so many things in the body. Additionally, if you want to reduce your migraines, I would look no further than reducing the inflammation of your gut. You can do this by doing an anti-inflammatory diet, anti-inflammatory supplements, etc. We have a strict forum food list, if you are interested email able900. I would focus on probiotics on bringing you a cure, not antifungals. Antifungals just kill the candida…what you need to do is change the environment within the gut so that candida doesn’t thrive nearly as much. -raster"
0,shayfo,178,"Yesterday was the five-month mark for me!! Hooray. At my 120 Day update, I was still having some issues with tinea versicolor, acne, fairly mild menstrual pain, and focus. All of those have subsided, aside from mild menstrual discomfort, but I’m not sure that’s something I can expect to go away fully. Uteruses are uteruses. I don’t have any need or desire to take medicine to dull the problem anymore, and that’s huge. I seem to be having some slight digestive issues again, which is a bummer. I digest my food pretty completely, I think, and on a reasonable schedule, but I’ve been having softer stools again sometimes, and more bloating/gas. I suspect this is because I was using glycerin-based vanilla extract and glycerin-containing kelp iodine for a few weeks. Research tells me glycerin can cause gas. Woops. I am tentatively planning to slowly reintroduce foods starting in June, assuming my bloating issue has subsided by then, since aside from that, I’m symptom-free. Any thoughts?"
1,goingnatural,178,"Congratulations on reaching the five-month mark! Not an easy task, for sure. My other thoughts are to remind you that this is a journey not a race, think of this as a lifestyle change and make sure you try foods one-at-a-time. Sometimes you won’t react to a food until the second time re-introducing a given food item. All the best towards your continued healing!"

10,shayfo,178,"Fair point. I plan to be cautious with fruit, though I do plan to eat it. I’ve been doing a small amount of research, and it looks like berries, peaches, nectarines, pineapple, and cantaloupe are relatively low in sugar, even compared to Granny Smiths.

0,Nekotamo,179,"Hello fellow sufferers! Today I have finally finished the 3 month long strict diet and am now slowly starting to introduce other foods while making sure that I don’t eat anything with sugar or any dairy products (besides kefir) for a long time. What I am about to write is my story and essentially the result of being on the strict diet for 3 full months. Things I got rid of: -Enormous urge to take a nap in the afternoon (now it’s much weaker and it happens from time to time, not every day as it used to). -Itchiness all over the body while sleeping (especially the pelvic region). -Most of my skin rushes. -Very small improvement in terms of brain fog. -Nystagmus Things that didn’t change: -Depression -Anxiety -Depersonalization -Mixed emotions -Overall horrible mental “taste in mouth” -Memory issues -Cloudy thinking -Poor concentration -Poor overall brain performance Now since I apparently still have many mental symptoms and since my high levels of Immunoglobulin E indicate that I might very likely have some kind of allergy or something like that, I believe that Candida was just a part of my problem. Therefore people should not get discouraged because of my story. I suspect that I had some kind of allergy or Adrenal Fatigue alongside Candida Overgrowth that apparently still lasts. Please feel free to ask me anything, I would be glad to share my experiences with you and help you any way I can, especially since this forum has been very friendly towards me and have helped me a lot. Once again I would like to thank everyone who has helped me so far. Special thanks to 1533jd, orka1998, Able900 and raster!. I hope I didn’t forget anyone, if I did, it was unintentional, my memory is still like goldfish’s."
1,NiuBlau,179,"Did You ever do a test for heavy metals? A lot of times things like mercury are the reason why candida doesn’t get better. Also three months is not that long, maybe it just takes longer for You to heal. So You are going to stay on the diet? Just not so strict, right?"

3,Nekotamo,179,"Sorry for the late reply people! 🙂 NiuBlau, I haven’t done any test of that kind, as unfortunately that is available only in the capital city (Belgrade) and I cannot afford to do it right now :/ But I definitely agree, I’ve heard it over and over that mercury is many times the reason for the whole immune system dysfunction and constant reoccurring of Candidiasis. Not to mention that I have 5 amalgam fillings + have held a broken neon bulb in my room for couple of years :S I plan on staying on a less strict diet for as long as I can, lets say few more months. I don’t want to burden my mom any longer than that. But I certainly don’t plan on eating anything sweat/dairy/bread for couple of years (granny smith excluded). Able, I’ve added this spice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegeta_%28food%29 (I’ve just realized that it contains sugar :S dammit! but it’s probably a very small amount since the taste of it is everything but sweet). Most kinds of meat, beans, this type of rice – http://bezglutena.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/p524-scaled1000.jpg?w=500&h=670 and that’s pretty much it, everything else is the same, I even still eat buckwheat bread(Lucy Liu’s receipe) which is awesome. I still drink Kefir and still take probiotics of 20 billion bacteria. Is that ok enough for a 2nd stage diet?"
4,Keya,179,"Nekotamo, I wouldn’t eat Vegeta as it has sugar and additives. You can mix various candida-approved spices to get better taste of the food."
5,Nekotamo,179,"Thanks for the advice Keya, but my family already thinks I’m a hypochondriac of how strict I am with all this, they say – “come on it’s a small amount of sugar, there’s a small amount of sugar in almost any food”. It’s just so hard to explain to them that just because my 3 consecutive stools were clean doesn’t mean that I may be 100% healed and that my Candida may not come back again if I am not careful. They have that huge, naive type of trust in official doctors and their diplomas (which to me mean literally nothing, as some of them never even heard of candida before)."
6,Keya,179,"I’m so sorry to hear that you don’t have that complete support. I know how hard it can be to explain to people that you can’t have even the smallest amount of something. Maybe get them to read something about candida or talk to them about your symptoms and how bad you feel. I’m lucky my family accepts this diet and is willing to help, but I make my food by myself so I know what’s precisely in it 🙂 I wish you best of luck! 🙂"
7,Nekotamo,179,"Yes, its hard to explain to them. Don’t get me wrong, my family is really understanding and supportive and worrying…but that is the problem 😀 They are worried that I’ll get even more skinny and will lose vitamins and minerals and would feel even worse. It’s also not easy because I don’t want to burden my mom with cooking, she has a lot of obligations at work and at home already, my diet really puts some extra weight on her shoulders, I wish I knew to cook :S I often ask myself – why there isn’t such a thing as “health debugging” 😀 where you pay doctors monthly to track your body and do all POSSIBLE TESTS THAT EXIST IN THIS WORLD and then simply narrow down the circle around the problem until they finally find it. Human kind…the only race in universe that invests in unnecessary stuff such as reality shows, yet isn’t investing in things like those…I’m speechless."
8,Nekotamo,179,"I just wanted to throw an update on my health and let everybody know about this in case somebody is experiencing the same thing. I somehow got to do the test on Quantum Magnetic Resonance Analyzer, and I am thankful to God that I did. What that awesome machine have told me is that I have severely low amino acid called “Lysine”. It is now a 4th day that I take TwinLabs’ L-Lysine supplement (two tablets a day) and I already notice a pretty significant change in certain symptoms. Also it discovered that I have a mild form of gastritis and few more mild conditions. So let me update my current state. Things I got rid of: -Enormous urge to take a nap in the afternoon (now it’s much weaker and it happens from time to time, not every day as it used to). -Itchiness all over the body while sleeping (especially the pelvic region). -Most of my skin rushes. -Very small improvement in terms of brain fog. -Nystagmus -Depersonalization -Mixed emotions -Overall horrible mental “taste in mouth” -Lack of energy Also the depression and anxiety are kind of getting better, but basically they are there cause some of other problems I have in my life :/ But it’ll get better 😉 Hopefully this can help someone and please if you have a chance and can afford to do a test with Quantum Magnetic Resonance Analyizer please do so it is worth of every penny."
0,charlie1,180,"Hi Everyone, I just wanted share some info with you all. I’ve been battling with my intestinal candida for two years now and although I had actually cured it to a degree, it came back late last year. I had lots of upper abdominal pain and that was treated by doctor’s with PPI’s (anti-reflux medicine) and all my candida symptoms came back, mainly chronic fatigue. I believe this was due to radically lowering my stomach acidity, giving the candida a chance to thrive again! The PPI’S never worked anyway, I’ve finally had to have surgery to correct the pain. However since then I’ve been hard at the diet again and have been taking a few types of anti-fungal in the past 4/5 months. I have been doing quite a bit of my own research into candida and speaking with Holistic doctors and reading various books by other renowned doctor’s. Some research has shown there is nothing better at killing candida than the action of oxygen being released into the intestines. This can take the form of oxygenated magnesium supplements which just kill off anything nasty including candida/parasites and completely cleans out your intestines. I think everyone should be using this to fight candida personally. Another product I was prescribed from a holistic doctor here in the UK was something called Immiflex which is a combination of beta-glucans and vitamin D3. Beta-glucans is a yeast but don’t be alarmed it actually works to weaken the candida biofilm in your intestines. I have to say that I had to stop taking all my products about two months ago as the die-off was so severe however, I’ve still been experiencing severe die-off. I put it down to the beta-glucans as per the info I have read about it, I really feel that it has completely weakened the candida. This actual product may not be suitable for everyone as it does contain sucrose but I would think in a very small amount, it didn’t effect me. I have actually posted in the advice section about my die-off but I’m massively turning a corner now. All of my other associated symptoms have almost completely disappeared, i.e nasal congestion, flatulence and really profuse sweating. I have been taking Molybdenum (amino acid chelate 600mcg daily, milk thistle 3000mg 3 x daily and Vitamin C 1000mg 3 x daily. I just wanted to share this as I’ve been battling with my probs for so long and I really believe in the supplements I have been taking. I’ve posted some links for you guys to check out. The product OxyTech is the one I’ve been using however I’m not sure how available it will be in all countries but there are other types. http://www.globalhealingcenter.com/natural-health/beta-glucanase/ http://candidaclinic.org/ http://www.dulwichhealth.com/acatalog/OxyTech.html"
0,Szuzn,181,"Hello everyone. I’ve been so miserable that I was begging to find a forum where I could learn more about this process…. and here you all are! I’ve always been relatively healthy, active, did pretty much anything I wanted ie worked full time, was a wife, mother, vocalist with a group for 17 years, performed several times a month, restored three historic homes, practiced yoga for 32 years. I conceived easily, had one child when I was 22, then eight miscarriages. Divorced 13 years ago, did well for five then crashed in 2006.. literally couldn’t get out of the bed one day. Diagnosed with severe hypothyroidism and stage 5 Adrenal fatigue. I’ve had difficulty losing weight and yoyo’d from 120-140 most of my adult life. I’m 59 yo, 5’3″ and now weigh 135. After being diagnosed HypoT and AF, I would stabilize for about 2 years, then crash, change meds, protocol, etc. In 2010-2011, I took HHCG 3x and lost the same 15 pounds three times. Always regained it regardless of diet or activity. In Oct 2011, I was in an auto accident that totalled my car, and was hit by both airbags, and hit my head on the roof. There were no obvious injuries, but within a month, I started getting sick… sinus infection, flu, another sinus infection- took antibiotics, tamiflu, etc and just couldn’t get well. I lost down to 116 and looked like a ghost. As the weather warmed up, I got some better but still had tremendous fatigue issues. Throughout all of this, since 2000 when I separated, I’ve had frequent diahrrea that looked like mush or sand, and was dark brown, regardless of what I ate. The docs and I thought at first it was stress. I also had symptoms of MS ie foot drop and eyelid droop… but again, they thought stress. I got through the summer, spent a lot of time outside at the beach after work and on weekends, and felt better, but still had to nap and go to bed early. I also fell in love. I was feeling enough better that I tried in August 2012, to go off the topical hydrocortisone that I’ve been on for Adrenal Fatigue support, since 2008. It was not pretty… and I ended up in Winston Salem NC with the head of the endo dept, who took me as a patient as a favor to my boyfriend, who’s a D.O. but, he was very traditional and had nothing new to tell us, other than said that I just needed to get used to slowing down. Ha! I felt like I was in a cave the winter of 2012… more sinus, more flu, more antibiotics.. and I rarely take medications, mostly supplements. By March, I was desperate… and a friend reminded me that her son is a chinese doc/herbalist/acupuncturist. I went to see him and started on a treatment of chinese herbs that seems to help with my energy. But I continued to feel bad/fatigued/depressed. So I found a therapist who specializes in supporting folks with chronic long term illnesses and uses jon kabbat zinn’s mindfulness techniques. That has also helped. Then, about a month ago, I read something about Candida, and it all clicked. I did the saliva in water test, and mine was cloudy, sank straight to the bottom, and stayed there… no dissipation. I called my doc, who’s alternative, and she said she’s suspected that for a while. Put me on Diflucan and grapefruit seed extract. I’ve eaten a ‘clean’ diet for most of the past 15 years and for 3+ years absolutely no grains, no sugar, no dairy other than the occasional cheese and butter, and have taken coconut oil 5-6 T a day, plus probiotics for several months, as well as the A-biotic by Dr. Rawls Vital Plan- these two things made me feel better immediately after starting them. I haven’t eaten anything processed in so many years i can’t remember.. only fresh veggies, seafood, chicken, eggs, meats, and the occasional strawberry or grapefruit sections on a salad with avocado and red onion. I was vegetarian in the 90’s for 5 years, but went to high fat, moderate protein and very low carb for Adrenal support. The primary change since starting the Diflucan, had been giving up merlot. It hasn’t been difficult. Its been harder to give up cheese and butter. I found an almond cheese and am using Ghee… please let me know if those aren’t ok. I started Diflucan on a Thursday, a little over a week ago, and by the second day was sick as a dog. Horrible headache, stomachache, sore all over, and tired. It got worse and worse. I was also jittery under my skin, felt weepy, and was tossing and turning at night. Doc said to stop it for 2 days, cut out 1/4-1/2 thyroid meds and see what happened.. and to add charcoal. I didn’t have the headache, nightly jitters, or flu feeling, but was so tired. Today, I started back on it and I’m miserable. If this is the way it is… I’ll just figure out how to tough it out. I’ve read that it can cause not only physical but mental/psychiatric symptoms… adn I believe it. As a former social worker, I wonder how many folks with thyroid or candida issues get misdiagnosed! I’ve added oregano oil, charcoal and have also been using the Pau d’Arco tea. My gut feeling is that Candida has been an issue for me for a very long time. Doc says after a month on Diflucan, she wants to start me on Nystatin. How can I continue my life, go to work every day when I feel this bad? I though the adrenal fatigue was bad enough… but I could stay in the bed all day! I’ll read the forum for ideas and learn from you all, but am grateful for any thoughts, suggestions, etc. Best, Szuzn"

4,Nekotamo,181,"Szuzn, that was a very tough story, but I think you should be proud that you got through all of that and finally are getting closer to the core of your problem. From all that you have mentioned here, to me it sounds that your problem definitely might be candida related. For example I had bad fatigue and insane need to take a daytime nap and it almost disappeared after 3 months of being on a strictest candida diet. Seeing that one of your biggest problems is lack of energy/fatigue I think this diet can only be beneficial to you, even if it helps just with that single symptom. Just be patient and persistent and you will get yourself back on track! I wish you the best of luck!"
5,Szuzn,181,"Thanks so much,Nekotamo! I’ve made a list of the additional supplements, dosing and timing, but still can’t find the recommended foods list.  I’m very disciplined and certain that I can follow the diet, but every time I click on the link to ‘food items’, I get a general info page. Any suggestions? Thanks, susan"
6,many sparrows,181,"Hi, Just searched for ghee and found your post. I had the same problem with the food list, its all a bit confusing but then I found another link that Able had sent which worked . I would ask Able to send it again, if you haven’t already. With regards to how to cope with feeling bad (including anxiety symptoms) IMO the way to tackle it is(1) to work out how to have the anti-fungals high enough to be killing the candida (and producing die-off) but low enough to be able to cope(even if that means having a few days here or there feeling terrible)(2) I think the key is in using supplements and methods to detox the stuff which is being released into your bloodstream/system. I’m not an expert but I’ve been working this stuff out bit by bit for years, making loads of mistakes. Many of the anti-fungals I’ve taken -for example, oregano oil,made me feel terrible and so I simply cut the dose down to one I could cope with and then built up the dose slowly. There are so many things you can do also to assist your body detox, which makes it all so much easier.Some of the things that have worked for me are: walking (any othr exercise is too much but walking seems to be gentle enough to not make me ill yet also helps to detoxify me and I always feel better.Another physical thing to do is have a warm bath,even better if it has Epsom Salts in it(one cup),even better if preceded by something which makes you sweat(exercise,sauna, wrap yourself up in blankets even) Take milkthistle ,molybdenum,nettle tea, burdock tea and any other detoxifying herbs, or drink. Just drinking extra water(sipping) makes a difference.There are all sorts of micronutrients,minerals and phytochemicals which can help too, so you can build up an arsenal of ways to make the die-off much more liveable. Hope this helps."
7,Ruffian,181,"I can relate with so much you said Szuzn. For me it has been a slow battle over many, many months. Sometimes it seems I even take a step back. That’s when I change up what I’m taking a little bit and get stricter with diet, plus add more probiotics. I’m just now seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. This is not an overnight fix I’ve learned. It’s a long war unfortunately. But I might be finally winning. Goodluck!"
0,AnnieLuc,182,"Just got my blood work back and it shows my IGg &IGm went higher. I’ve been on a VERY strict candida diet for 4 months now with NO cheating, also have been on nystatin for that 4 months sooo, needless to say I will be stoping the nystatin. It’s very upsetting/frustrating that my blood work went higher. Thankfully I found the sf722 online and can’t wait till it gets here. I guess I will be reevaluating my strategy tonight. I just can’t figure out why it went higher. The Dr. suggested I balance my ph with mixing buffered vita c powder with a little pure baking soda so I’ll try that too. Thanks for listening to me vent! I will update again as soon as anything changes."
1,raster,182,"My naturopath doesn’t use nystatin even though he can prescribe it. The reason is because it causes the candida to go deeper into the body in his opinion. He has an analogy “if you walk by my house everday, and I punch you everytime you walk by, what are you going to do? You are going to go down a different street!” SF722 is out and really made a major difference for me. -raster"
2,AnnieLuc,182,Thanks Raster!  What are your thoughts on Diflucan? The Dr. wants to switch me to that for 30 days. I’m wondering if that will be another waste of time… I should have the sf722 in the next day or so and I can’t wait to try it.

0,tlentz1108,184,"Hi all, I have been diagnosed with various health issues like Gerd, respiratory allergies, asthma, migranes, IBS, Eosinophilic Esophagitis, gluten and dairy intolerances, frequent urinary tract infections, broncitis, ulcers, etc. The doctor’s have prescribed me numerous medications from anti-acids, anti-fungals, antibiotics, pain and nausea meds, inhalers, etc. After a trip to the emergency room the end of Jan 2012 for constant vomiting, severe stomach pain and dehydration, I became fed up and started researching on the internet. After much trial and error, I started making improvements in my health issues by taking mastic gum, dgl, manuka honey, and l-glutamine to heal my ulcer and help with acid reflux. This helped but did not totally take away all my symptoms like the gluten and dairy intolerances, diarrha, intestine pain nor help with the fatique and insomnia. So I started a Candida/Leaky Gut diet. This helped some more, but I was still having problems and found out that I had a parasite infection as well. So I started taking Syntol and Paragone to kill the candida and parasites. This was very effective at killing them and I felt even better, but I still didn’t seem to have much energy. Now I am taking extra vitamins like A, B-complex, C, E, Zinc, Cal, and Mag. I’m also taking Carlson Cod liver oil gels and Coconut oil softgels as well. This seemed to increase my energy and I have been feeling much better, but I have had a few reactions to gluten and dairy if I’m not real careful or there is cross contamination. I guess this is a permanant lifestyle change now, and I have been doing this so long by myself that I think I can use some support to stay motivated and not fall off the diet. I have just recently started adding some foods back to my diet like a limited amount of fruit and occasional potato. So far, so good, but I am really so tempted to eat foods that I know I should probably never eat again. Anyway, does anyone ever totally get rid of candida? Any suggestions that I haven’t been doing so far? I am real excited to be a part of this forum and looking forward to getting to know everyone. Well wishes, Teresa"
1,raster,184,"If you completely got rid of candida you would be dead because we need candida to survive…so no, there is no way to completely remove it from the body. The vomiting and pain very much sounds like h. pylori…you should check that out and see if the symptoms match yours. You can get a simple blood test to see if you’ve got an overgrowth. -raster"
2,tlentz1108,184,"Hi Raster, Thank you for your responce. I did have H-pylori, which caused some of the problems with my stomach and the ulcer. The mastic gum, dgl, manuka honey and L-glutamine helped to heal that. After finishing up a 60 day treatment to get rid of the H-pylori, I no longer needed to take any more prescription acid reducers and have’t since. The remaining symptoms of food intolerances, allergies, headaches, insomnia, brain fog, swallowing difficulty, mouth sores and thrush, IBS symptoms, low blood sugar, high blood pressure,etc where still there. I did some more internet research and found out that often h-pylori, candidias and parasites all go hand in hand when your immune system is really run down. I also had a swallowing problem where food gets stuck in your esophagus where you often have to throw up to clear it or go to the emergency room to get it removed. This condition (Eosinophilic Esophagitis)is sometimes caused by Candidia growing in your mouth and esophagus which cause damage and strictures or narrowing of the esophagus. The gluten and dairy intolerance may be Celiac, but I don’t need to prove that either, because I know that I feel 100% better when I don’t eat foods with these ingredients. Occasionally, when I eat food that has been contaminated with these ingredients unknowingly to me, I will get severe intestinal pain, bloating, gas and have diarrhea. After finishing up the treatment for my ulcer and h-pylori, I started the Candida diet along with taking enzymes to help me with digestion b/c I had undigested food in my stools. This did help some more with digestion, but not the candida. Then I noticed a parasite after a bathroom trip, and I decided to get serious about killing off the candida overgrowth and parasites. I originally took a probiotic that made me severely sick (die-off), so I found another product called Syntol that did kill the candida (as evidenced in my stool) without making me as sick, but didn’t help with the Parasite problem. I started taking the Paragone (black walnut, cloves, wormwoood among other ingredients) and this really helped kill off not only the parasites, but loads of candida. I had a lot of die off and detox symptoms during that time. One of the remaining problems that still was hanging around after finishing up with the Syntol and Paragone was the fatigue and insomnia. I started taking vitamin A, B Complex, C, E, Zinc, Calcium and Magnesium. I also started taking the Cod liver oil gels (these have D3, A, and E in them as well) and coconut oil gels. This really helped to increase my energy level, started sleeping a little better, and lessened my fatigue. I also really got into many herbal teas with plenty of anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties to them. Since following the treatment I have described, I no longer need prescription anti-acids, allergy meds, inhalers, pain medication, anti-fungals, steroids, etc. This was not accomplished through regular medical doctors, but through my own persistance, research, and trial and error. I have been feeling mostly better for the past 3-4 weeks. I gave the doctors over 20 years of following their treatment, listening to their dignosis, continual expensive testing, taking every prescription they threw at me and got continually worse and worse. I left one doctor who had the gall to tell me that I was a Hypocondriac when I had a severe bronocitis infection, was coughing severely and could barely talk or breathe. I ended up at the urgent care center where they exrayed my chest, diagnosed me with broncitis and again prescribed me with a anti-biotic, prescription cough syrup and an inhaler. I was sick for 6 weeks before I got reasonably better. I have very little faith in the medical establishment and will not seek treatment from them or have any more expensive tests done unless I need emergency treatment. So far, I haven’t had any health issues that haven’t been healed from natural or herbal supplements purchased at my local Vitamin Shoppe. Even a severe kidney, bladder and urinary tract infection I had last October which didn’t get better after taking anti-biotics was healed by taking D-mannose with Cranactin. I have more faith in knowing what my body feels and needs, people who have experienced what I have been through, have gotten better and are willing to share what helped them. That is why I joined this forum, because there are real people here willing to share their experiences, treatments, and advice without monetary motivation. I don’t feel the need to have anymore tests to prove that I had H-pylori, Systemic Candidias overgrowth, and parasites. The proof is in the evidence of die-off in my stools when I was taking the Syntol and Paragone, the healing of my body and how much better I feel now. I definetly want to keep ahead of this happening again and have new eyes about health and nutrician. My problem now with feeling better is that I am tempted to eat and drink things that I enjoyed all my life. This is another reason that I joined this forum so that I never forget how hard it was, where I came from and why I am better now so that I don’t return to my old habits. I keep re-reading my journal from the past four months for added motivation. Plus the fact that doing this without much in the way of experienced advice, I’m sure that I made many mistakes along the way and want to get better educated about this condition so maybe I can help others. I guess with our bodies needing candida to function in balance with friendly bacteria for digestion that as long as we don’t trash our bodies again with poor eating and drinking habits that it shouldn’t overgrow again. That is my hope. Again, many thanks for this forum and your input. Much appreciated, Teresa"

That is my hope. Hello, Teresa. Once you cure the infestation completely, the only way it’ll return is if you feed the normal Candida yeast lots of sugar or foods that change into sugar in the body, or possibly if you have to take several rounds and high doses of antibiotics. If you cure the infestation, and have to take the antibiotics, you should immediately return to the strict diet and start adding very high doses of probiotics in supplement and kefir forms. Able"
4,tlentz1108,184,"Hi Able, I really don’t intend to take anti-biotics again if I can help it. The supplements worked better anyway for me.

6,shayfo,185,"Maybe the metabolic waste from working out is too much for your liver and kidneys to deal with on top of the candida toxins? It might be easier to try yoga for a while. It’s low-impact, but it’s still strengthening."
7,alexalgebra,185,"Yeah, I wouldn’t work out too much at first, until you really have some strength/energy back. I wonder if the sweat is drawing out some toxins as well?"

9,klips32,185,"Sorry for bad gramma in the last post 🙂 I’ll only take walks from now, that’s it, maybe ride my bike 20mins ore so. @Hope: The starch in the probiotics are mostly consumed by the bacteria inside when released. Also, the amount is so little compared to how many friendly bacteria is in there."
10,klips32,185,"I will update today with pictures of my diet these days. I’ve eaten a lot of the anti-candida whole foods such as rutabagas, brussels sprouts and others in the same family of vegetables. As I wrote before in earlier post: I get worse from food that both kills yeast and bacteria, such as garlic, rutabaga and many more, you know the deal. Over the last days, my conditions is getting worse, not die-off worse, candida worse. I get more overgrowth then I had in a quite long time. It was better to eat yughort 4x times a day and more green vegetables. I mainly get better eating probiotics and prebiotics such as green leafed veggies and anti-fungals that only kills yeast. Now I’m thinking of doing a cleanse: Get rid of most of my flora, since the effects of any probiotic only last for 20mins and I really don’t believe that the bacteria content down there is damn fragile. My plan is: Cleanse for 1-2 days, then use Kefir 4x a day, green vegs and probiotics. What do you guys think of this?"

12,shayfo,185,"When I started drinking kefir, I got really tired and really gassy, and had some headaches…those little bacteria sure know how to wage war. It started to get better within a few days for me, though."

Nystatin, diflucan, coconut oil, olive oil, probiotics etc. works great, all the anti-microbal stuff just makes things worse."

Examples of lipid-coated bacteria are: herpes simplex, Rubeola, streptococcus, H. pylori, HIV-1, and the influenza virus. The weakness could be a die-off reaction from the coconut oil, or since you ‘believe’ that the coconut oil is killing your beneficial bacteria, it could be a psychosomatic symptom.

0,Julia,186,"My story in a nutshell. Hi everyone I am a 36 year old female. I have one 13 year old biological son and 4 medical/special needs foster children who are 12, 10, 6, and 3 years old. I have a degree in nursing which I do not practice in hospital at this time but I truly believe “life” sent me to university not only to be educated in helping others but to SAVE myself! Lets go back many many years…. I had a stressful childhood to say the least needed much therapy in my adult years. Then at age 15 I left home and lived a very destructive life full of alcohol, smoking, a poor diet, and nearly every drug possible for many years. It was a constant daily party. I put a lot of drugs into my body with no regard ever for what it may be doing to me. By the age of 22 I jumped on the bus one morning and I simply moved to the big city away from that life style. By this time I was still smoking and drinking some but starting to get sick. I was having thyroid issues and had been on several antibiotics for bladder infections, strep throat, and pneumonia etc.. I had debilitating migraines and met the most wonderful life saving chiropractor. He was the reason I was able to get a job. He sorted out all my back issues and headaches issues and he was the first person to ever mention the words “systemic yeast” to me. Of course I didnt’t think anything of it and just carried on.. By age 24 I had stopped drinking and smoking and I had a c-section to deliver my son. Shortly after his birth I had my first partial thyroidectomy. I had a constant struggle with sleep, severe chronic PTSD symptoms…anxiety, panic etc By age 26 I started university… my son was 2 years old, I had no money, no car, no supports. Every day was a struggle. I was also in a closet relationship (more stress) and my sons father was no paying support and constantly bringing me down and blaming me for being broke since it was my choice to go to school and be broke (more stress). From 26 years to 30 years old… I had my second partial thyroidectomy which now ALL my thyroid gland had been taken out. I had asthma, bronchitis, worse sleep patterns, bladder infections, my heart was out of control with PVC and PAC’s, I could not regulate my temperature or my nervousness either. I went to several doctors all of who said I was stressed and prescribed multiple medications from anti depressants to antianxiety meds. I kept telling them that there was more then just stress wrong with me. I KNEW there was more wrong with me. I was so scared my heart would stop beating. I almost past out from it a few times. Very scary. Some days I could not climb the stairs without stopping 3 times to catch my breath bc my heart would start racing and drowning my lungs in fluids. No one listened. I just carried on. 4 years later I graduated university! BIG day in my life of struggles. Lots of pride! I starting maternity nursing and loved it. I struggled everyday with being sick but i was so happy to finally have “made it” in the world. I could finally provide for my son : ) I moved to the country shortly after that. I could not stand living in the city anymore. Just the smell of the exhaust from the vehicles infront of me would give me a huge migraine. I became so incredible sensitive to smells. I changed all the detergents and soaps etc… I started having debilitating kidney pain and pneumonias. I was now in a small town with small town doctor who put me on IV antibiotic therapy for cure my “kidney infection” even though the blood work stated i did not have one. He also would put me on IV anti biotics for pneumonia which now i think back and know it was yeast infection : ( I was tossed around doctor to doctor for kidney testing MRI’s, CT scans etc (I live in Canada so this was all free) all my testing came back negative. The only thing left ofr the docs was to say i must be crazy. So I went to even more therapy…hohum.. Finally after months of unbearable kidney pain i was back at my chiropractor and he said “it is a yeast infection in your kidney’s, that’s why the docs can’t ‘find’ it”. He recommended some green powder from the health store which i tried to no avail. At this point in my life I had no idea how to treat systemic yeast and just assumed a doctor must know! I went into the hospital one day after not being able to eat or drink or sleep or work for days upon days. I was really at my end. I couldnt handle the pain and nothing helped the pain…plus i had developed an allergy to any narcotic medications. I explained to the doctors why i was there and they told me that i had been tested and there was nothing wrong. My world crubled apart. I litteraly could not walk back out the doors without feeling suicidal and so thats what i told them. So I was committed to the psych ward! Well at least i got to stay! I was given meds to sleep (which i desperately needed. Some different sort of pain med (which helped a little)…more antidepressants augh, more anti anxiety meds and lots and lots of therapy! 6 weeks and i was sent home on all those drugs and sleepng pills too. For the following year ontop of suffering with the usual heart problems, lung, kidney, bladder, sinus (oh ya broke my nose and had to take coious amounts of anti biotics for MONTHS for that), poor vision in my left eye, constantly clearing my throat, sick all the time with colds and flus…then i became allergic to EVERYTHING…reactions so bad my throat swelled and i carried an epi pen everywhere scared to death. I could not eat, smell or touch almost every food, smell or metal. Around this same time I had started researching natural cures for autism since my new 2 year old foster son was suffering from that. It taught me all about yeast in these children’s guts and the correlation to the brain etc….ALL the same as systemis yeast in adult!!! Unreal really. So I changed his diet and followed the protocols on this child and within 3 days he was a different boy (it took much longer to get him completely off the diet…more like 2 years) but he was severe. He went from not being able to talk, potty train, look you in the eye, he couldn’t taste, or feel pain, he couldn’t process thoughts or sleep and he screamed and kicked constantly banging his head on everything, the agency was in planing stages of sending him to an institute to be medicated forever : ( into a fun loving boy who is now in grade one : ) From his diet the light bulb when off in myself. My allergies pretty much told me what i could and couldn’t eat so the diet change was not hard plus i was already cooking the same diet for the foster child. I started on supplements just like i was giving to this child and probiotics too. I stopped all prescribed medications for me and for him. I started taking natural products like GABA, Taurine and Melatonin to help myself and him with sleep…and sleep we did for the first time in our lives it seems! I also drank H2O2 … a food grade hydrogen peroxide to help kill off the yeast and kill it it did! Die off was unreal but only lasted about a week and then it was like a miracle started to happen….3 months later I was 75% better is ALL my illness even my kidney pain was gone. By 4 months I was starting to add things into my diet and go out for dinner and lunch once in awhile with friends etc. Have a glass of wine with my steak etc. I lived very happy and very healthy for the next year with NO illness other then the odd cold which a couple glasses of H2O2 would cure straight away. I carried on with life! I was so happy all of that was behind me. My anxiety magically left, panic attacks were gone, nervousness gone, temperature regulation was back, my heart never missed a BEAT!…my lungs were clear, my sinuses didnt hurt, my head didn’t hurt and i could THINK! : D 2 months ago the cat went to the vet and little did we know he came back with campylopactor poisoning. (terrible bug in the gut that poisons you with toxins). My 3 year old got into the litter box like 3 year olds sometimes do. (still unaware at the time). One week last she has a diaper full of bloody stool so i took it in for testing. One week after that the rest of us in the house had caught it. I dont think i have ever felt so much pain in my life. Constant raging cramps, nausea, fever etc. I lost 15 lbs in 4 days. I was not able to carry on and needed a very high dose of antibiotic for 10 days. Today I am 2 weeks back on the diet!! I do not want to go through this by myself again so I am hoping for support and am always happy to be supportive as well! My diet is not as strict as some on here. I do eat some brown rice pasta with my meals but otherwise it is sorta all the same. My symptoms are not as severe as the first time around but I do have chronic sinus infection, bladder infection, vag yest infections, some kidney pain, allergy to kiwi?, asthma?, constant throat clearing and my heart is a little jumpy again too but not as bad as years past. My doctor saw the amazing transformation from the last diet and so she was willing to prescribe 200mg of diflucan for 20 days (I honestly can not see it making a difference at all!) but was worth a try. If you made it to the end of this long story thanks for listening!! : D 😀"
1,Kag,186,Geez… wow Julia… What a story. You sure have been through and done alot. Thanks for telling your story!
2,Kag,186,Geez… wow Julia… What a story. You sure have been through and done alot. Thanks for telling your story!
3,Julia,186,"Yes it is hard for even me to read…and that’s all in a nutshell! My therapist always told me I should write a book! lol the doctors and specialists could never ‘find’ anything wrong with me. They could see it on the heart monitors but couldn’t tell me why. The allergist tested me and told me I wasn’t allergic to anything and that it was all psychological. One doctor tested my heart and on a monitor and when my heart started racing at 210 bpm he told me it was high but still normal. unreal. I told him maybe if i was on speed running from a bear but not just from walking down the hall!!! grr Had to go to emergency once because my heart was beating out of control. Emerg doc said it is benign and that it wouldn’t kill me…and then when I wouldn’t stop asking why it was happening she told me she would prescribe beta-blockers. Augh My heart problems happened shortly after my thyroid surgery and the cancer surgeon (they thought I have thyroid cancer) who cut out my thyroid told me to go see someone else because it had nothing to do with him and that I was just stressed and then left the room when I began to cry and 5 minutes later a therapist came in. She could tell from our conversation I knew the difference between what stress feels like and what my heart skipping beats felt like. she tried to tell him but he refused to listen. My thyroid medication was adjusted about 20 times in the next 3 years thinking that it must be thyroid issues causing all my illness. One doctor even went so far as to say I adjusted my own medication just to make myself sick!!! Wow did I scream at him! The endocrinologist had nothing to say. My gp at the time just kept trying to push antidepressants which i kept refusing telling him i was happy in my life but sick not depressed. His answer was I was a single mom, on assistance in full time university so of course i was stressed and depressed. I love my son and loved university! But at the time there were no doctors taking on new patience so I had to stick with him. boo I am happy to report I have a wonderful medical doctor now who has seen me through the worst and seen the diet work with her own eyes. She is very curious about it and very very helpful. I am also now able to afford a natural path doctor (these ones are not free in Canada) who is also onboard with me and we spoke at length last week. She is happy that I am on the right track and reassured me that I was well versed when it came to curing myself and has no doubts I will do it a second time. I also found this site for support which is something I did not have last time. It has been hard to accept that there are so many other people out there who are suffering from this as well but it is a huge relief and weight lifted to know I am not alone in my battle. One day at a time… : )"
4,MichaelH,186,"chronic stress is so harmful. I went through about a decade of severe stress from various things. I started having panic attack in 2006. I had one episode that lasted over 12 hours. I didn’t really know what it was but described my symptoms to a pharmacist when I was overseas. She gave me some Xanax (yup I could get it over the counter in this country) and Wow.. what a lifesaver. I kept getting them all the way through last March and Xanax was always there to keep me from going nuts. Here’s the deal. Since recovering from cancer treatment and getting my life in order, my diet in order, controlling stress… I haven’t come close to feeling any anxiety since July. I’ve recently made several long airplane flights and don’t keep any Xanax there as a “safety blanket”. You know you mentioned being sensitive to smells in the past. We have a bread factory that is on my way home from work. On nights I’d work late and drive by the place, the yeasty smell from the place would make me really nauseous. Wierd. I’m good now though. So you are back on the diet Julia..and you’ll get through this again. But… maybe look at your regular diet and see where you can make some additional changes that will keep your immune system boosted and your body working as close to 100% as it can. It might mean cutting out some things, but it won’t be that bad and in the end, feeling great trumps the few minutes of joy you get from a certain food that might not be doing you any favors."

Also, I think the brown rice isn’t quite good for candida, try buckwheat or oat bran instead, forum members are using these without symptoms. And just hang in there, and try to stay on the diet if it’s making you feel better 🙂"
6,Julia,186,"Thank you both for your replies! : ) It is encouraging having supports!! My doctor will be keeping an eye on my liver : ) I have to say though I don’t see a difference from it at all. I think the natural yeast killers work just as well if not better and yes are less harmful to our systems. Also I every time I eat something with just the slightest bit of sugar or starch my throat instantly get yucky phlegm. It is my ‘radar’ so to speak to stay on the foods I know I can eat without disruption. I do eat some brown rice noodles (maybe 1/2 cup a day max) and I do not have the phlegm effect. I also ate it during my first detox and also fed my foster son brown rice in moderation as well during his autism recovery. The diet I follow allows this and even allows other starches in a bit later. I had huge success and so I don’t doubt that it is ok (this is for me, however If others are not comfortable to eat it then please don’t). I had huge success just over a year ago with this diet and my foster son did too. As for now I think I will be keeping to the same diet but thank you for the advice! : ) If I wasn’t making any changes yet at this point I would be concerned about my intake but other then a little brown rice noodle the rest of the diet is the same it seems, but so far I have experienced everything much like the first time detoxing. Die off was terrible for the first week. This week it hasn’t been nearly as bad and I am starting to feel a million times better already! I will stay on this plan for 3-4 months and then reassess at that time. I will take probiotics for life! : ) Take care and thanks again for the advice and support! It means so much to me! : )"

8,raster,186,So are you saying you have parasites now? This sucks! Have you looked into black walnut extract? -raster
9,Julia,186,Hi No not saying that at all but i did drop off stool sample this morning to test parasites and ovun and campylobactor just to be sure.  I have been taking black walnut for two weeks now three times a day as well as others.  I am curious to know what made you think i have parasites though? Take care : )
10,Julia,186,Hi Seren Ohh that throat phlem can drive a person crazy! I never knew it was a sign until i cured myself the last time. Its such a relief when it goes away! It also drives my partner crazy lol Once that clears my lungs are usually not far behind. No more asthma attacks! Or chronic bronchitis cough and or unproductive coughing. I cant wait! Take care!
11,dvjorge,186,"Julia, Great Story !! I believe I can say why Diflucan isn’t working. Don’t believe it is a bad antifungal because it isn’t. Diflucan is a systemic drug. It means it will go straight to your blood in the upper intestinal tract. Systemic drugs such as Diflucan have a low or no impact on the candida colonies living inside the intestinal lumen. There isn’t blood irrigation inside the gut to carries a drug. To target the fungus living on the mucus layer that cover the intestinal walls, you need a non-systemic (non-absorbed) drug such as Nystatin or most fatty acids. This is the reason you notice the naturals more effective. However, the naturals have weak parts too. Both, systemics and non-systemics have a role during a fungal overgrowth. There is more about it that we can discuss ahead. I am here to share my knowledge. Since you are a nurse, you may have the basis to understand many medical terms necessary to know this syndrome. Please, don’t call it systemic candida because it isn’t. This syndrome is better called Candida Related Complex. In this way, MDs take you more seriously. Jorge."
12,Julia,186,"Wow Jorge! Thank you for the info! I did not do any deep research into Diflucan…very interesting. I am curious though that I have NEVER and I mean NEVER had a problem with my ‘guts’ that I am aware of. I have always been very regular every day. No bloating or gas. I mean I fart but nothing out of the ordinary. I rarely get constipated or have loose stool. I never had pain in my guts until campylobactor poisoning, but that’s a given with anyone who is unfortunate enough to come in contact with that one. I have never had heart burn not even when I was pregnant. I don’t even know what that would feel like but it sounds aweful. I guess I’m starting to think (and this is just my own ramble in my mind) the yeast infection in my kidney must have obviously got there via urethra from my chronic vaginal infection. I do not get typical vag infections of burning and itching. Mine is inside the canal. It is full of thick yeast in there…ALWAYS! …until yesterday lol YAY! (that’s another post) So I am assuming the yeast form my vagina made its way (just as bacterial infections do) up into my urethra and into my bladder…yes… makes sense now why I had and have so many bladder infections! Augh that was always probably yeast irritating my bladder walls wasnt it?! grrr I took a lot of antibiotics for those infections… then up the ureter and into the kidney. booo I also have yeast in my sinuses, throat and lungs. It has affected my nervous system, heart and thyroid and left eye. I wonder why not my guts? or is it just that i don’t have gut symptoms? It must be in my guts too? Curiouser and curiouser I will stick to the Diflucan…maybe even for a longer duration now if my liver will tolerate it. Maybe it is helping my kidney’s because since I started taking it my kidneys have a very different on and off mild pain about them. I am wondering/hoping maybe that is the yeast die off in the kidneys. So much is unknown…all I know is I am starting to feel better. : ) You are right…telling a doctor you are trying to cure systemic yeast will get you a lot of very strange looks lol. I am so glad I finally have a great doctor is on board with me. She is only a few years graduated and sharp, so sharp and curious about this. Her brother is a chiropractor. They are a very very nice family. She shows knowledge and respect, she is kind, caring and always patient. She will sit and listen to EVERYTHING you have to say and take all of it into consideration and will research anything she is not familiar with. She has always been honest about not being taught how to deal with this sort of condition in med school. She is amazing. I wish everyone here was fortunate enough to have a doctor like her. Thanks again! : )"
13,Julia,186,"Ohhh look at the info i just found! LOVE IT! I will be staying on this for certain! DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) is indicated for the treatment of: Vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida). Oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open noncomparative studies of relatively small numbers of patients, DIFLUCAN was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia. Cryptococcal meningitis. Before prescribing DIFLUCAN (fluconazole) for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see Clinical Studies section. Studies comparing DIFLUCAN to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted. Prophylaxis. DIFLUCAN is also indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Dosage and Administration in Adults Single Dose Vaginal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for vaginal candidiasis is 150 mg as a single oral dose. Multiple Dose SINCE ORAL ABSORPTION IS RAPID AND ALMOST COMPLETE, THE DAILY DOSE OF DIFLUCAN (FLUCONAZOLE) IS THE SAME FOR ORAL (TABLETS AND SUSPENSION) AND INTRAVENOUS ADMINISTRATION. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to result in plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy. The daily dose of DIFLUCAN for the treatment of infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient’s response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or recurrent oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse. Oropharyngeal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse. Esophageal candidiasis: The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution of symptoms. Systemic Candida infections: For systemic Candida infections including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia, optimal therapeutic dosage and duration of therapy have not been established. In open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients, doses of up to 400 mg daily have been used. Urinary tract infections and peritonitis: For the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections and peritonitis, daily doses of 50-200 mg have been used in open, noncomparative studies of small numbers of patients. Cryptococcal meningitis: The recommended dosage for treatment of acute cryptococcal meningitis is 400 mg on the first day, followed by 200 mg once daily. A dosage of 400 mg once daily may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient’s response to therapy. The recommended duration of treatment for initial therapy of cryptococcal meningitis is 10-12 weeks after the cerebrospinal fluid becomes culture negative. The recommended dosage of DIFLUCAN for suppression of relapse of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS is 200 mg once daily. Prophylaxis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation: The recommended DIFLUCAN daily dosage for the prevention of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation is 400 mg, once daily. Patients who are anticipated to have severe granulocytopenia (less than 500 neutrophils per cu mm) should start DIFLUCAN prophylaxis several days before the anticipated onset of neutropenia, and continue for 7 days after the neutrophil count rises above 1000 cells per cu mm."
14,Julia,186,"Just talking…it’s what I do…. I am still going to stand 100% behind food grade hydrogen peroxide as my yeast killing agent. It will penetrate at the cellular level and kill and it does it all with oxygen which will also repair the gut not to mention endless other health benefits…and it cost so little.  Three months, three times daily. Increase by one drop daily. Easy. I am confident beyond words that I will get my life back once again! : D"
0,spider,187,"Hi guys, I am a 20 year old male college student, and have been suffering with candida overgrowth for what I suspect to be several years. Thinking back on it, I’ve always had strange chronic health problems that normal MD’s can’t seem to help me with. Starting when I was maybe 10 years old, I began contracting chronic Pinworm infections. Every time I took medicine for it, it worked, but came back months later. It wasn’t until I did thorough research and started taking probiotics (at around age 14) that I was able to eradicate my chronic and recurring pinworm infections. Since middle school, I’ve always had a thick yellow/white coating on my tongue, accompanied by extreme fatigue and yawning. I always thought that perhaps I just wasn’t getting enough sleep, but I believe that the tongue (oral thrush) symptoms and the fact that I used to yawn over 100+ times a day might be because of candida. I even saw a doctor who asked to look at my tongue, and told me it looked like I had the digestion of an 80 year old man who drank 4 Cokes a day…however, I’ve never been a junk-food eater..always have eaten fairly healthy. (he never diagnosed candida though). Another thing I thought I might mention is that I have suffered with Chronic back-pain for nearly a decade. I have Scheuermann’s Kyphosis in my thoracic spine, and nearly all the discs from my thoracic spine up to cervical spine are degenerated (small, black, and lacking fluid). Although I have been prescribed pain meds for several years, I rarely use them and opt to just endure my pain…I occasionally use 50 mg Tramadol to help me (maybe once a week, although I used to use it every day at certain intervals in my life). Apologies for side-tracking, just included incase it might be relevant. During high-school, for about 2 years I took a low-dose of antibiotics for my acne….I’m sure this screwed with my gut and created imbalances that probably led to my extreme candida overgrowth…If only I had listened to my parents and not cared so much about a little acne. During my senior year of high-school, I became sexually involved with a girl who suffered from chronic yeast infections, and began contracting yeast infections myself. Before her, I had had multiple partners and never had any adverse/allergic reaction post-intercoruse. The symptoms with this new partner were redness and unbearable itchiness. When the infection was severe, I would have red bumps on the shaft of my penis as well as scrotum, and even red bumps that would begin running down my leg towards my knee. I went to many doctors who gave me antibiotics, told me I had jock-itch, told me I had hives, gave me dozens of different creams. The only thing that ever worked was Diflucan, but nevertheless, I would receive another infection. Even after I stopped seeing my partner who suffered herself with chronic infections, I myself was contracting these horrible and unbearable infections approximately every three months. I suffered from many sleepless nights, and often thought to myself that I could not continue living with constant scrotal itchiness. I was also furious that absolutely no doctor (MD or dermatologist) could help me. They all seemed like a bunch uneducated fools. I saw some of the top Dermatologists in NYC, who literally told me that I simply “have an angry scrotum.” I decided enough with the useless doctors, and spent months doing my own research. Not only was I suffering from a severely itchy groin, but I also had a lot of oral thrush, extreme fatigue/brain fog, moderate acne, and horrible dandruff. I also suffered from extreme nausea as well, especially post-meal, and anxiety. I could tell my immune system was/still is somewhat weak, as I tend to always get what’s going around. Last year I had 4 throat infections that required antibiotics. Finally after months of research, I decided with 100% certainty that candida overgrowth was my problem. In particular, it was the fact that I took antibiotics for years combined with extensive binge-drinking, that really caused me problems. Freshman year of college I joined a fraternity, and drank heavily about 4 times a week. By heavy, I mean typically between 10-20 drinks followed by blacking out and hangovers that lasted until the following evening…I was on my way to becoming an alcoholic I believe, and was known as that guy who is always hammered when he is out. After my freshman year was when I became certain Candida was my problem. I took it upon myself to cut out sugar and all grains/high starch veggies, to cut my drinking down, and I begin rotating natural anti-fungals. Since then, I have not experienced the horrid scrotal itchiness, and I have generally felt much better. I do however still have mild itchiness in my groin area, and I believe this to be in part because I have not given up alcohol completely. At one point, for 3 months this year, I not only followed the candida-diet, but I also gave up alcohol completely. It was during this time that about 90% of my symptoms were gone, I felt more energetic, my head was clearer, my dandruff gone, my libido was strong, and my scrotum regained a skin-like color instead of the color of a firetruck. Recently I have been slipping up and drinking alcohol on the weekends. When I drink, instead of getting hammered and blacking out on multiple beers/mixed drinks, I sip slowly on Chopin (potato vodka) and seltzer. I’ve heard potato vodka was ok, but for me personally, I notice a discoloration of my tongue the next day, and I honestly just feel worse. It’s really hard being in a fraternity and not drinking heavily/at all, but I know if I ever want to cure myself, this is what I need to do. This summer I plan on following the protocol. I want to feel more energetic, think more clearly, regain my old libido, eradicate my itchiness, clear up my tongue, and BEAT CANDIDA! Thanks for reading, any comments or advice are much appreciated. – Spider"

2,alexalgebra,187,"Hey spider! The protocol on the forum here has worked some absolute miracles for me in just four months. I’m not cured, still have a ways to go, but I am feeling SO MUCH better than I was! I had a little slip a month ago where I overextended myself and it really brought me down for the last few weeks, but I’m getting back to where I was. My best advice is to follow the diet to the letter, don’t cheat, keep your spirits up as best as you can, and take it ridiculously easy. Also, quit drinking. It’s just going to prolong things. Eventually, you will be able to drink again in moderation (other people can tell you more about that than me; I haven’t touched alcohol in about six years because I’m a recovering alcoholic), but for now, it’s best to just forget about it. Hopefully your frat brothers will support you in being a better, healthier you!"
3,spider,187,"I have had luck in the past following a strict diet that includes organic grass-fed meat. I’m a big proponent of eating paleo and I’m a fan of Mark’s Daily Apple, so I will try to eat a paleo/candida diet. I’ll also cut out all grains, sugar, fruit, alcohol etc as well as use and rotate potent probiotics/antifungals. I’m very strong-willed so I don’t think cheating will be too much of a problem – my only weak spot is alcohol which I definitely need to overcome. Also, what do you mean by taking it easy? I’m a basketball player, so I exercise and workout several times a week. Glad to see you’re doing much better!"
4,raster,187,"Even though I don’t think alcohol feeds candida it does damage the liver which is a very important organ you need for your general health. I used to be like you when I was a freshman, it is pretty normal. As you get older, drinking will become unimportant so its only something that influences you for a decade or so. Eventually you may realize that the friends you are around only care about getting messed up and not many discuss other things. If you exercise a lot you may want to reduce or eliminate this while on the candida diet; you need to build your immune system and not your muscle mass. Most people experience major fatigue while on the diet and so if you work out a bunch, it simply makes it worse by draining your adrenals which you need for healing. Light walks are an ok form of exercise (and other things such as yoga, tai-chi, karate, etc). Streneuous draining exercise is generally not a good idea. -raster"
5,alexalgebra,187,"What raster said, LOL. I take walks sometimes; I live in a walkable neighborhood near a park. I also take yoga once a week. I used to take dance classes, but i’ve been off of them since December and I think that was a wise decision. I can’t wait until I have the energy for them again, though! Hopefully this summer 🙂"
0,mtgirl99,188,"I’m a 30-something mother of 4 who was in denial about my candida overgrowth for a while. I honestly don’t know how long it’s been a problem, but I knew a couple of years ago that sugar (particularly chocolate) was something I knew I was having too much of, but was afraid to quit. My background: I’m allergic to homogenized cow’s milk – have been since I was very small, but could tolerate it in small amounts as I got older. I’ve had hayfever since I was about 10. I went through the scratch testing when I was 12, and it confirmed my allergies to things like grass, various weeds, and dogs (though we had dogs growing up and they never seemed to bother me – just the cats after they came in from outside). I was on allergy shots for a while, but haven’t had them since I was a teenager. I’ve had some bad side effects from allergy medications in recent years and the general feeling that they weren’t doing any good anyway, so haven’t had any in a couple of years. I have irregular, heavy periods and had a problem with secondary infertility (trying to conceive my 2nd child). That prompted me to change my diet (away from refined sugar & flour), but the lack of sleep and exhaustion from taking care of babies always seemed to drive me to more sugar & caffeine. I’ve been on antibiotics following all 4 of my pregnancies due to some sort of weird tissue retention (possibly placenta?). Other than that, antibiotics have been rare for me, and I’ve been generally healthy. My biggest issues now: 1) Brain fog  2) Lack of energy 3) Constant swelling of my tongue & mouth tissues (neither my doctor nor dentist have any clue why, but that is what lead my doctor to diagnose me with oral thrush in February) What I’ve done so far: I’ve gradually cut out yeast, all forms of sugar, wheat/gluten, dairy, most fruit, and most caffeine (I still have coffee once or twice a week). Just doing this, I have lost 10 lbs. My one stronghold to still conquer is tortilla (corn) chips. I know if I plan ahead more, I can have other snacks on hand to help me stay away from those types of food. My biggest complaint is that I’m allergic to stevia (according to my reseach, if you have an allergy to rag weed, you have a good chance of being allergic to stevia). It’s frustrating when I want a little bit of sweetness, and can’t have anything! Two newer sweeteners I’d like to find out more about are tagatose and Luo Han extract. That’s my story in a nutshell!"
0,Nicola Hart,189,Hi I have just been reading some of the information I have printed and there is so much conflicting information. Can anyone recommend a book to use which is idiot proof to help me through this? Nicola
1,Tiffanoodler,189,“The Body Ecology Diet” by Donna Gates
2,Tiffanoodler,189,"Oh. What happened? That book was the first thing I had read about any candida diet. It’s extremely hard to stick with, I’ve been struggling."
3,goingnatural,189,If it is for some good candida advice I’d suggest Ann Boroch book (She cured her MS which was caused by Candida). http://www.amazon.com/Candida-Cure-Program-Restore-Vibrant/dp/0977344614/ref=la_B0043O5JFA_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366081790&sr=1-1 If it is to gain an appreciation for the early understanding and treatment of this condition I suggest googling Dr. Truss and Dr. Crook (there books/treatments may be a wee bit outdated but still serve a useful purpose).
4,rick49er,189,I also bought the body ecology diet. Very interesting method and one which is in some way similar to eastern ways.
5,alexalgebra,189,"Body Ecology doesn’t talk about antifungals at all, it only focuses on diet, but the diet is not right for candida. Any proper candida diet shouldn’t have you eating potatoes, amaranth, etc. Also, a lot of the “facts” are untrue, such as the one about red potatoes having less sugar (look up the nutrition data, I think they actually have more than regular potatoes). There are a couple of good points in there, like trying to eat 80% veggies, eating fermented foods and so forth, but a lot of it is made-up facts with no sources and a plot to sell her overpriced Body Ecology products."
0,Butterfly68,190," Hi All, Started the diet two days ago and I’m just so hungry all the time. Didn’t want to go too strict since I have Meniere’s disease and I just don’t know how I will react. What can we have as snacks?  I’m also doing the LiverDetox from RenewLife which lasts 30 days. After the 30 days are up, I will start with the antifungals. So here’s what I basically eat : AM Eggs with olive oil Brussel sprouts Lunch Chicken Salad with Hemp seeds with olive oil and lemon PM Fish Green beans with olive oil I sometimes take a tablespoonful of almond butter (when I get too dizzy from hypoglycemia). I also have Nettle Leaf and Chamomile herbal tea a few times a day and I drink about 2 to 3 litres of water (3 glasses with lemon in it). I had to start taking psyllium powder since I’m having problems in that department. Am I doing this right?"
1,Butterfly68,190, Forgot to ask something. I’m cooking a whole chicken in my crockpot today and planning to use the chicken stock to make a soup with vegetables tomorrow. Is that ok?
2,reds119,190,I feel you pain. I have started this diet in Nov. failed and retried. I think you can make a vegetarian broth to drink. There is a recipe on this website for it along with food (vegetables) you can have. I am new to this but will help you as much as possible. Change in their it can only get better right?

4,Jujublue,190,"I’ve been doing the diet for over 17 weeks you just kind of get over the feeling of being hungry eventually. Plus, I try to eat small amounts of stuff throughout the day. An afternoon glass of green juice seems to help. I juice 2 cucumbers, a slice of ginger, a lemon, and a handful of spinach and sweeten it with stevia. Hope that helps 🙂"

6,shayfo,190,"Juice is great! My favorite combination currently is kale, cucumber, celery, parsley, lots of ginger, lots of lemon. I eat veggie sticks with guacamole fairly often. With all the fiber and fat, it’s pretty filling. You could probably also keep a few hard-boiled eggs around for when you just really need to eat something ASAP (besides a celery stick :p ). Stick with it, it gets better (eventually)!"
7,alexalgebra,190,"If you get hungry, just eat more veggies! I know, bleah, what a boring snack, but they can keep you going. You just have to eat often. Once you’ve added in coconut flour, the coconut bread is a great way to sustain between meals. Also, coconut oil is satiating and you can put melted coconut oil on pretty much anything and everything."
8,klips32,190,"If you really only eat what you list there, it’s no wonder that you starve a lot. Eat 6 times a day, add more oils and vegs that are allowed on the diet, some of them contain some carbohydrates. One serving of asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, green beans, and iceberg lettuce contains 2 g of sugar. One serving of green cabbage contains 3 g of sugar. A serving of bell pepper contains 4 g of sugar. One serving of onion contains 9 g of sugar. A serving of broccoli contains 4 g of sugar. Rutabagas are recommended as an every-day-antifungal on the protocol; they contain 10 grams of sugar per serving. Avocados can be eaten daily on the diet; one avocado contains approximately 17 grams of carbohydrates. You can track your meal energy levels on some fitness websites, but try to look at your weight, if you loose weight to fast, get more food."
9,raster,190,"Hello Butterfly, I would look at trying to double or increase the amount you eat by a minimum of 1/3. This is how my wife eats but I don’t think its good enough for the diet because your body is burning a lot of energy to heal. -raster"

Also, try to prepare ahead of time like Mrs. Candida said, I am five weeks into diet and I feel better. My stomach is actually worse, but my lip rash is at bay now, which really bothered me. I am hoping to cut back on some of the herbal stuff I am doing in 3 or 4 weeks."
0,Luke,191,"Three weeks ago I had a small bowel series done at the hospital. I was required to drink two glasses of barium, after which they would x-ray my small intestine from several different angles. The problem was that they couldn’t find my small intestine. The barium apparently reached the area in which they were searching far quicker than normal, too, so they had to call in a specialist in order to get the proper x-rays. I visited the gastroenterologist yesterday morning to get my results, and he said to me that there’s a 99.9% chance that I have Crohn’s disease. He also said that, without a biopsy, he cannot confirm the diagnosis. Naturally I am very concerned as this is a disease with which I will live for the rest of my life. That is, if it is in fact Crohn’s disease. He explained that the walls of my small intestine are highly inflamed; so much so that, when I had a colonoscopy done last year, they couldn’t access it because it was “too tight”. My reason for this post is to gain a bit of insight on the matter from those who are more familiar with leaky gut syndrome than I. Could it be possible that leaky gut is the cause for this inflammation? Does leaky gut and Crohn’s function in a similar way? I ask because I don’t have many of the symptoms typical of Crohn’s disease. I don’t experience severe abdominal distress and, while my stools are always loose, I rarely have diarrhoea. The only symptoms consistent with his diagnosis are weight loss due to malabsorption, the urge to defecate sometimes immediately after eating (again, not diarrhoea), and some stomach issues. I always figured these symptoms were associated with candida/leaky gut. I have been on the diet for approximately three weeks, and I’ve noticed an astonishing difference in mood. My skin had initially began to clear, but it has since broken out again. I seek a bit of clarity, here. Could this be in the realm of leaky gut? I appreciate any insight."
1,goingnatural,191,"Many alternative provider’s believe that stomach conditions ranging from IBS to Crohn’s can be caused by candida and other pathogenic fungi/bacteria. Stick the lifestyle out, I’m willing to bet in time (we’re talking 1 + years you will be symptom free). Your body needs time to heal."

My skin had initially began to clear, but it has since broken out again. I seek a bit of clarity, here. Could this be in the realm of leaky gut? I appreciate any insight. Luke, look up my story on here. I have had a quite an ordeal. For years, I had a stomach issues. Then, a couple years ago, I found out I had colitis. Then, I had my colon removed in June 2011; ileo-rectal anastomosis. However, over time, I still was not feeling well. I always had the pain on my left side, and I would bloat all the time on my left side. I had chronic indigestion, etc. Then, I found out that I had gastroparesis. It took 8, 12+ hours for food and liquids to leave my stomach. So, in Jan. 2012, I had a gastric pacemaker inserted. I do believe this is the best surgery for me because I actually feel like eating again, but I still have to watch certain things. Later in the year, I still was not feeling right though. As the device was speeding up my stomach, it was finally affecting me bowel wise in a big way. The doctors were not helping me at all!!! I could alternate b/w constipation and diarrhea. Laxatives were too harsh (no colon-hello!), but then I could feel like I had to go and couldn’t. I hated trying to take anti-spasmodics, Imodium, laxatives, etc. It was not a balance. As I started to read more, I first got started on reading a gastroparesis book by Crystal Sateralli. She started me on the right path to alternative methods after she had her pacemaker inserted to help her become stronger. She talked about vitamins, diet, etc. to heal yourself because the pacemaker is a tool that helps, yes, but it still depends on you. After that book, I started to read books from Brenda watson, all her products are not good, but her probiotics rock (too strong at first if you haven’t changed your diet and starting cleansing-I am just at the point where I can tolerate some stronger probiotics now). Also, her intestinew, if I can afford it sometimes, l-glutamine is my favorite as well. So, what I am getting at here, is yes, I believe sibo, candida, leaky gut is in fact can be the same thing as crohn’s. I would try this out, and I believe this whole year I am just trying to heal my body inside from the abuse of laxatives, ppi’s, etc. that doctor’s told me about. I feel I could have avoided some of that mess, which is why my system became so messed up. I am still battling the war now, and my intestines can get very rumbly, which annoys me, gas (thinking maybe I could have gotten sibo, too). I do not get bloated as much as I used to, which is a plus!!! Like I said, I am just trying to clear up the digestion, flow naturally (no rumbly, no constipation, no diarrhea). Also, I have urinary problems, anxiety still at times (better, and I am def. having more energy some days now), and insomia (better, but still an issue). Good luck, and keep up posted! Glad you are not having severe symptoms as mine! So, yes, I believe leaky gut, Crohn’s, Candida, sibo go hand-in-hand. If you need anymore advice, feel free to message me! =) I do feel my case is a little different compared to most people, due to the no colon aspect."
0,alexalgebra,192,"Hello all! Today marks my 90th day on the quest to eradicate my candida. For a recap of my story – basically, I spent the last year prior to these last 90 days feeling miserable and slowly becoming allergic to everything to the point where the only thing I could eat was eggs, small amounts of rice, bananas, and small amounts of rice without any reaction. My reactions would generally include extreme fatigue, to the point where I would fall asleep sitting up, and heavy brain fog. I also had a lot of anxiety, depression, and irritability. I went to five different doctors and nobody could help. The last one finally did a stool test for me and discovered candida, which gave me a reason for my problems, but they didn’t offer a good solution. The sent me to yet another doctor who recommended the Body Ecology Diet. I did that for the first week or two, then found this site. On the BED, I didn’t really experience much die-off, except for cravings. When I switched to the diet and protocol from this forum, I had a few days of pretty intense die-off, and a couple of rough weeks, then things started getting better. This is all chronicled at my blog, Sometimes Alex Eats. At this point, I’m still sticking to the strict diet, 100%, aside from a stupid slip with a tea that had “natural flavors” while I was on vacation (I made a post on the forum about it called Stupid Starbucks). The only things I’ve intentionally eaten outside of the strict diet are flax seeds, pumpkin about once a month, and a little bit of non-alcohol vanilla extract which I’m pretty much weaned off of. I basically eat the same thing every day, more or less: – breakfast of hot cereal, rotated between oat bran and buckwheat – veggies sauteed lightly in coconut oil for lunch with some combo of broccoli, onions, garlic, cabbage, brussels sprouts, zucchini, and whatever else is lying around  – dinner of some kind of leafy green, usually cooked and/or blended into a soup or more sauteed veggies, with 2 eggs of some kind, maybe with a buckwheat, teff, or coconut bready thing – snack on coconut manna, approved bread products, homemade granola in greek yogurt, veggies throughout the day These symptoms have disappeared either completely or almost completely: – irrational anxiety – excessive food intolerances – bladder/urethral pain (directly caused from eating sugar only) – sleeping all day – depression, hopelessness These symptoms come and go, but are largely better than before: – soft, unformed BMs – undigested food in BMs – brain fog – fatigue These are getting a lot better: – feeling overwhelmed – lack of sustained energy…I can do things for a short period of time or slowly over a sustained time, but not a lot for a long time – inability to sleep more than 6-7 hours a night – gland pain in the front of my neck – intermittent pain in my right hip These are new since I started the cleanse and possibly die-off related(?): – white coating on tongue – occasional toe twitches I’ve cut back my molyb to just 1 250mg a day, and I’ve been rotating in and out of taking capryllic acid and just doing food antifungals only. I’m taking 5 of the Megaflora 20billion probiotics a day and drinking water kefir, as well as drinking commercial dairy kefir and eating greek yogurt probably every other day or every 2 days (dairy still wigs me out sometimes, I can’t think about it too hard, recovering vegan I guess). Other than that I’m taking these supplements: – 3000mg vit c – 2 tabs of ashwagandha – 5000 biotin – 2 drops iodine – chlorophyll – 2000 lglutamine – cal/mag/zinc – multivitamin (I know these aren’t recommended but I’ve just been using up a bottle I had) – spirulina – 4 capsules milk thistle – A&D – pantothenic acid I think that’s all of them. Some things that have been extremely helpful in this process have been: 1. Learning to chew my food 30+ times with each bite. 2. Listening to the voices of experience on this board. 3. Staying very strict to the diet and protocol. 4. Rotating anti-fungals. 5. Taking a lot of vitamins. 6. Minimizing my life stress. 7. Pre-planning my meals each day. 8. Having positive mindset about candida, even when it can sometimes feel like a death sentence. This is probably the best thing I’ve done. So…go me! I wish I was cured by now, but I’m not, but let me tell you, it’s a freaking MIRACLE I’m doing as well as I am considering where I was 3 months ago. I was literally at death’s door, making plans to kill myself over this because it was too hard to get through the day with all of my food sensitivities and never knowing what food would set them off next or how long it would be before I literally couldn’t eat anything. So thank you, everyone on this board, for all of your input and stories and hope. You have truly saved my life."

Glutamine uptake gives candida albicans resistance to antifungal agents. It also enhances the ammonia synthesis by candida albicans. Note that I advice to stop it for a while thinking to the moment where you have eradicated most fungal colonies in the intestines. Then, it will help you to correct the leaky gut. The most important is to eliminate the fungus because leaky gut is the result of the inflammation caused by it. Curcumin and Lauric acid are very strong antifungals. Curcumin is synergistic with fatty acids that target the ergosterol part of the cell membrane because it has different antifungal mechanism affecting not only ergosterol but different parts of the cell membrane. Same thing happens with Olive Leaf Extract. Jorge. Antifungal activities of origanum oil against Candida albicans Vijaya Manohar,1 Cass Ingram,2 Judy Gray,2 Nadeem A. Talpur,1 Bobby W.

Preuss1 1 Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC; 2 North American Herbs and Spices, Waukeegan, IL; 3 Department of Pharmacy Sciences, Creighton University School of Pharmacy and AHP, Omaha, NE, USA Received 27 June 2001; accepted 14 September 2001 Abstract The antimicrobial properties of volatile aromatic oils from medicinal as well as other edible plants has been recognized since antiquity. Origanum oil, which is used as a food flavoring agent, possesses a broad spectrum of in vitro antimicrobial activities attributed to the high content of phenolic derivatives such as carvacrol and thymol. In the present study, antifungal properties of origanum oil were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Using Candida albicans in broth cultures and a micro dilution method, comparative efficacy of origanum oil, carvacrol, nystatin and amphotericin B were examined in vitro. Origanum oil at 0.25 mg/ml was found to completely inhibit the growth of C. albicans in culture. Growth inhibitions of 75% and >50% were observed at 0.125 mg/ml and 0.0625 mg/ml level, respectively. In addition, both the germination and the mycelial growth of C. albicans were found to be inhibited by origanum oil and carvacrol in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of origanum oil was examined in an experimental murine systemic candidiasis model. Groups of mice (n = 6) infected with C. albicans (5 × LD50) were fed varying amounts of origanum oil in a final vol. of 0.1 ml of olive oil (vehicle). The daily administration of 8.6 mg of origanum oil in 100 µl of olive oil/kg body weight for 30 days resulted in 80% survivability, with no renal burden of C. albicans as opposed to the group of mice fed olive oil alone, who died within 10 days. Similar results were obtained with carvacrol. However, mice fed origanum oil exhibited cosmetically better clinical appearance compared to those cured with carvacrol. The results from our study encourage examination of the efficacy of origanum oil in other forms of systemic and superficial fungal infections and exploration of its broad spectrum effect against other pathogenic manifestations including malignancy.

Source Department of Biosciences, Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi 110025, India. Abstract Curcumin, an important Asian spice, is part of many Indian food preparations. This work evaluates the antifungal activity of curcumin against 14 strains of Candida (10 clinical and 4 standard). Curcumin displayed antifungal properties against all tested Candida strains, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) varying from 250 to 2000 µg·mL⁻¹. The in vitro effect of curcumin on growth, sterol content, proteinase secretion, and H+ extrusion by plasma membrane ATPase was investigated for 2 standard strains Candida albicans ATCC 10261 and Candida glabrata ATCC 90030 and compared with the effect of fluconazole. At MIC, curcumin inhibited H+ extrusion in 2 species of Candida by 42% and 32% in the absence of glucose and by 28% and 18% in the presence of glucose. Respective inhibition of H+ extrusion caused by the MIC of fluconazole was 85% and 89% in the absence of glucose and 61% and 66% in its presence. Ergosterol content decreased by 70% and 53% for the 2 strains following exposure to curcumin at MIC; comparative values for fluconazole at MIC were 93% and 98%. Curcumin and fluconazole decreased proteinase secretion by 49% and 53%, respectively, in C. albicans and by 39% and 46%, respectively, in C. glabrata. In conclusion, curcumin is found to be active against all tested clinical and standard strains but is less effective than fluconazole. Antifungal activity of curcumin might be originating from alteration of membrane-associated properties of ATPase activity, ergosterol biosynthesis, and proteinase secretion."

0,Emsmith,193,"I started this road to recovery 9 long months ago. I’ve made a lot of improvements, but have also had some setbacks. More recently I binged on ice cream and cookies, consuming more sugar in a few hours than I’ve had in 9 months. Overnight a bump appeared on my knuckle accompanied by joint pain. This appears to be a bouchard node, related to osteo or rheumatoid arthritis. To think that I caused an auto immune or degenerative disease by a few poor choices really pisses me off. So this is my attempt to lay out all my improvements, next time I think of throwing it all away. First and foremost my acne is what got me here. This is directly related to my diet, even though I’ve been told time and time again there is no way these two are related. The cystic acne is gone and I breakout when I cheat. The scaly, flaky, non healing scalp is no longer an issue. My energy, irritability, and sleep have greatly improved. My digestion is much better with 2 bowel movements each day, before maybe once every 3 days. My overactive bowel sounds are gone. My bowel movements are now formed, no more diarrhea/constipation. My evenings are no longer spent doubled over in pain for hours after eating gluten. My athlete’s foot is gone, until I cheat. My oral thrush has been gone for awhile. My lips are the healthiest they’ve been for as long as I can remember. My cloudy urine and smelly gas are gone. I no longer feel like I need a nap after lunch. I lost the puffiness I had all over, cankles no more. My pms is not nearly as bad as it used to be and the cramps have improved the most. The last improvement is my memory. As I shed the sugar, gluten, soy, dairy, corn, nuts, parabans, toxic cleaning chemicals, genetically modified foods, pesticides, etc. I truly feel like I’m becoming normal again. I was just a zombie going through the motions. I’m in control of what I eat and this directly correlates to how I look, act, and feel. My goal is to update this in 2 months and be symptom free by June."

2,Emsmith,193,"I forgot I also no longer have ear issues. Many days I felt underwater and had problems hearing. Also had annoying popping sounds and these are gone as well. No more headaches or hemorrhoids! But this damn bump on my knuckle is here to stay I guess. It grew a fluid filled sac around it, but at least the redness and pain are subsiding. Cheating is soooo not worth it."
0,Denv12,194,"Hi.I’m new to this forum.I hope someone can shed some light on my experiences. Back in 1994 I started experiencing food intolerances and I learnt how to deal with it everyday. Fast forward to 2006 I was drinking a lot of cola flavoured drinks everyday.I should have drank it in moderation.Over a period of several weeks I began to experience some real problems.At one point this turned into oral thrush.I didnt get it anywhere else.Later in 2006 I ended up with Obsessive compulsive Disorder (ocd).I’m almost cured of that now.And,I’ve had chroonic fatigue syndrome(cfs) since early 2000. My tongue was coated in some white frothy.I kept spitting out that white froth for what seemed like many weeks.My voice seemed weird.My hearing was blocked.At this point I would spit and cough out that froth,wipe my tongue with a cloth.Before I had something to eat I would do that routine so I could at least taste food. I love lemons.I could eat a lemon yet it didnt taste bitter anymore.I couldnt tell the difference between the sour/bitterness of a lemon and the sweetness of an apple.I’ve been eating a lot of apples since candida. I cut all sugar in my food intake.It was hard but it was worth it.I dont add salt and I dont buy salt.I cut out caffeine as well.I bake foods not deep fry.I started looking after myself by being treated by Kinesiologists and chiropractors who specialise in muscle testing techniques.I’m making great progress from ocd,I’m almost recovered from ocd. Can anyone relate to my experiences? Did something from the cola trigger of candida? Any advice will be greatly appreciated."
1,LizBell,194,Did you find the kinesiology helped a lot? (Even w candida?) I’m thinking about seeing one (a friend has had good results for allergies). I’m already doing homeopathy but they are very go-easy on the diet (nowhere near as restrictive as this candida protocol).

I’m already doing homeopathy but they are very go-easy on the diet (nowhere near as restrictive as this candida protocol). Hi. I had other health issues at that point but I knew that any form of muscle testing is a good thing. I would suggest finding Kinesiologists but avoid the ones who do the 26 exercises.They dont solve problems.They’re the dime a dozen.Forget them.You need someone who is thorough. The next thing is Chiropractors who do muscle testing.You should contact your local chiro association and specifically ask for a chiro who was either trained in muscle testing in the USA or more recently in New Zealand.They are the ones you need.The more techniques they do the better your progress.Just remember this that these treatments can take time.You might only need to go back every 2 weeks then spread your treatments further apart.Your body needs time to process the changes.I started my treatments 4 years ago and we still havent finished.I was in very poor health though. The first part of a treatment is purely for testing.The more they find wrong the better.It means they can fix it.They might do a few techniques to start with. I’m in Adelaide. Chris.
4,alexalgebra,194,"I’ve had a somewhat negative experience with muscle testing. I am not knocking it as a whole, because I might have just had a bad practitioner, but he really seemed to just be bumbling his way through everything he did, based on the information I provided him and some basic information I’m sure he got while he was in school. He never seemed too confident and I got some definite misinformation from him."

I think it might be wise to go to another one.Your local chirpopractic association can provide details of known practitoners who could help.Here in Australia there are so few of them.

0,MichaelH,195,"Hi Everyone. long post. sorry. Hmmm, not sure where to start. How about around 2008? That’s when I first started paying attention to my tongue which had a white coating. Sometimes it would be thick, and then at other time it would go away for a few days (like after drinking a bottle or two of red wine on the weekends). After doing a little research, It looked like it was Candida and I tried a couple home remedies like oil pulling. After a couple years, 2010, I went to the doctor and was prescribed anti-fungals which didn’t work. I also started developing a persistent cough. I finally went to see an ENT doc and was told it was Geographic Tongue. Whatever. I knew something was wrong. The underside of my tongue was a deep purple and into 2011 I started getting sick with flu like symptoms. How did I get Candida? Like many others, I had taken some heavy doses of anti-biotics. In my case for some fairly risky behavior (ok, unprotected sex with some gals that were not very clean as it turns out). Not only that, I drank pretty heavily and was under a bunch of stress. In 2005, I also got a really bad case of Scabies that was misdiagnosed as eczema for which I took prednisone in tablet and shot form. That went on for maybe 6 months until I found a doc that would do a biopsy and found the little critters that had burrowed into my skin. The cure for that was 2 courses of the heavy duty stuff – Lindane and then some follow on treatment with something more mild (forgot the name) Skip back to that part in 2011 where I was getting sick. I went skiing in December 2011 and on the first day, I got really sick and my tonsil blew up which had never happened before. From the ski trip, I had to travel overseas for work. Although my flu symptoms subsided, I still had the swollen tonsil. After a couple trips to an overseas doc, I finally got a biopsy. The results came back after I had returned home. The news was not good, but there was a silver lining. I had cancer in my tonsil (PET scan later showed in my left and right lymph nodes as well) but stage II. Furthermore, it was HPV related and that has been shown to be highly responsive to treatment. I started treatment in March 2012. 3 rounds of chemo with 40 rounds of radiation which I finished in May 2012. Wasn’t fun. So once I got diagnosed with cancer, I decided right then to make a diet change for a couple reasons. One, cancer likes sugar and two, I had also been pre-diabetic with my blood sugar values. But.. to be honest, I thought that when I was finished with treatment that I was going to woof down some pizza and delicious steaks. May and June were still pretty bad months but in June, I made the decision to take out my feeding tube early to force myself to take in nutrition orally. Hurt like hell and I was still pretty nauseous. At this point, I still hadn’t “woken up” to my new reality, but it was close. Mid-June, I started developing a numbness in the entire upper part of my torso. It was a burning numbness though. I don’t trust chiropractors, but massage and acupunture didn’t help, so at my wits end, I went to my current chiropractor who takes a holistic approach to healing the body. First order of business was taking care of the numbness which he worked out. He also got me back into the gym and got me juicing. I started responding quickly and really started feeling better. I also had a wake-up call during this time when I realized that my saliva glands were no longer producing enough saliva for me to eat those things that I used to love. I needed nutrition though and lots of the right kind of calories so I came up with my own drink that’s worth about 1200-1300 calories per “serving” (about 40 ounces). So fast forward to September. I had been in the gym 3 times a week, continuing to juice every day and continuing to refine my daily drink. I had heard that coconut oil was good for stimulating the thyroid so I added 4 tablespoons per day (2 in the morning drink, 2 in the night drink). Now.. I don’t know if there is a correlation, but in July I checked my Thyroid and it was at the low end (1.4) and in January I checked it again and it was 3.14, right in the middle of the normal range. I’m checking it again this June. coconut oil also has anti-fungal properties so that was in the back of my mind as well in September when I started taking it. Also in September, I noticed a rash breaking out around where my feeding tube scar was. Actually, it had always itched a little, but by September, the rash broke out and started spreading. Went and saw the doc and he prescribed Athlete’s Foot anti-fungal cream. That cleared it up for a bit, but it came back and spread to a different area a couple months later. So I stared up with the anti-fungal cream…worried that this was going to be a serious problem. All the while…. my diet had stayed consistent. Every single day, A nutrition drink in the morning and early evening, then juicing at night. By December, the Candida outbreak was gone and I noticed my tongue started looking more normal. As of right now, my tongue is a nice pink color all over and no hint of Candida. Furthermore, I had some fungal areas on my toenails and all that has turned to a white powder. It’s a lifestyle change. In a way, I was lucky. I was forced to make a change. Actually, that’s not totally true. I could choose to drink soda’s, eat candy, cake, ice cream etc. Here is the thing. Once you break the cycle and get off the carbohydrates, your body…you brain, doesn’t crave them anymore. I used to LOVE bread, cake, cookies.. mmmm. warmm bread right out of the oven with some butter. But now? I just look at it and go “Meh”. So the last time I check, my fasting blood sugar was down to 92. I’m hoping it is below 90 now. My HDL/LDL look great. But here is the important one.. my triglycerides are down to 42. That’s not a typo. 42. If you have never read any of the Zone books by Dr. Barry Sears, do yourself a favor and read “The Anti-Inflammation Zone: Reversing the Silent Epidemic That’s Destroying Our Health” By Dr. Sears. Follow that book, and I bet the Candida will take care of itself. In the book, he mentions High Quality fish oil. I use Nordic Naturals fish oil liquid and mix it with my juice. It has only a lemony taste. NO fishy taste or smell at all. I’ve take a different “diet” approach only because of my current limitations, plus I’m kind of in test mode, so any slight change I make, I can see in my blood test results because I do the same thing every day. Here is what my nutrition drinks consist of: 1/2 container of Nutren 2.0 (4oz). This stuff is 500 calories per 8 oz and is really meant to be consumed through a feeding tube. But. It’s loaded with all the right vitamins and minerals, protein, and medium chain triglycerides which are great for energy burning. 1 bottle of GNC total lean chocolate shake http://www.gnc.com/product/index.jsp?productId=4179707 Again. Loaded with protein, vitamins, minerals. Very low sugar (2g) 1 egg or comparable amount of egg whites. I’ve been alternating. The eggs I get are the organic kind with Omega 3 8 ounces Almond Breeze Chocolate Unsweetened – http://store.bluediamond.com/Almond-Breeze-Chocolate–Unsweetened_p_39.html 0 sugars, nice chocolate taste, good source of calcium, Vitamin E 1/2 Avocado – Great nutritional benefits, adds 0 taste, but thickens the drink nicely. Tablespoon of some kind of natural peanute/almond butter. I know this goes against some Candida diets, but I’ve been going after calories and my results have obviously been good. Can always leave this out if you want. 2 tablespoons of Organic Cold Pressed coconut oil 1 tablespoon Olive Oil. Not the cheap stuff. The real stuff from Italy with the peppery aftertaste. I get mine at whole foods. It’s not cheap, but then none of it is going to waste 🙂 1 tablespoon Udo’s Omega 3-6-9 oil. 1 scoop Vega One Nutritional Shake – http://myvega.com/products/vega-one-shake/features-benefits Oh man… this stuff is all kinds of good for you. At night I juice the following: 4 to 6 leaves of kale Handful of spinach 4 stalks of celery 4 carrots (yup carrots. Low glycemic load) 1 cucumber 1 Granny Smith apple 1 tomato 1 tablespoon of Nordic Natural fish oil For lunch, I’m rarely hungry, but I’ll eat some Mushroom barley soup or bean and kale soup I get from Whole Foods. I’ll have a cup of coffee maybe once every 2 weeks and some kind of alcoholic drink occasionally to be social. I get 8 hours of very restful sleep every night and every morning I have a very easy and consistent bowel movement (I had NEVER been that way before). I’m slowly getting my weight back..still. Before all this, I was about 192. At my worst during treatmen, I got down to 165. I’m at 184 now. My energy level is level throughout the day. NO spikes or dips. I’m never tired in the afternoons or any part of the day for that matter and I’m clear headed throughout the day. I’ve never, in all of my life felt this good so it’s pretty easy to not want any of the “bad things” that taste so good. Like most things.. a few moments of bliss may cost you in the long run 🙂 Just thankful I get a second chance."

2,Kag,195,"Thank you for the awesome post! I have had carcinoma in situ twice, also supposedly related to HPV, although I have never tested positive. I have also been trying to make some anti-inflammatory changes to my diet. I may get that book! One question, I find that fish oil gives me reflux. Did you ever have that experience?"
3,raster,195,"I would be very careful with those protein drinks because peas are high in starch and starch converts to sugar. Same with brown rice. Chocolate is inflammatory and can also cause problems for many people… If your almond butter is not fresh, it will contain molds which feed the fungus inside you, so be very careful with almond butter and its freshness. The stuff that is packaged at the store has been sitting there for weeks… If you want an alternative to the cod liver oil you are taking, I would check out fermented cod liver oil which destroys biofilms and has some prebiotic properties. It also has natural ratios of vitamins A and D. Good story and keep it up. -raster"
4,Julia,195,"Thank you for sharing this!!! You are truly an inspiration! Great job, keep it up and hang in there!!! : D"
5,MichaelH,195,"@1533jd Thank You 🙂 @Kag – Oh man, I couldn’t stand fish oil. I would get a little reflux and have a nasty fishy taste for a couple hours. The Nordic Naturals is ultra refined pharmaceutical grade. I can take a teaspoon right out of the bottle and just get a clean (oily obviously), lemony taste. 0 reflux or aftertaste. You owe it to yourself to at least try a bottle (I think there are other brands, but I don’t know the names)edit: I posted a link below, but I get it at Whole Foods. To Kag and others. My ENT had recommended that book to me for a while (A medical doctor recommending a book that advocates a healthy body instead of taking medicine? really?) I’m pretty skeptical on nutrition books.. there are thousands right? I finally went and got the book and it’s really an oustanding book. He explains the inflammation process in easy to understand scientific way. I was already doing a lot of the things in the book, so it was nice to see what I was doing was correct. Get the book. It will help give you the mental power needed to make a change (hopefully permanent) and to get started in earnest with getting rid of your Candida @raster. As long as my fasting blood sugar test results continue to drop. I’m not going to be concerned with the protein powder. I don’t touch any starches like bread, rice, pasta, potato. Maybe just a small bit on a holiday dinner to be social, but that’s it. If chocolate is a problem, then change over to strawberry or vanilla flavors. I go through a jar of organic almond butter within a week. Expiration dates and general product rotation seems to indicate fresh supply. If it’s a worry to anyone, don’t take it. I’m not taking Cod Liver oil. It’s purified deep see fish oil from anchovies and sardines. Here is the link: http://www.nordicnaturals.com/en/Products/Product_Details/514/?ProdID=1431 I’ve done this every single day since June with some modifications along the way, like adding Coconut oil, adding the fish oil, reducing by half the Udos and adding in the Olive oil. I can only report the results I have seen. Triglycerides low, Cholesterol great, Blood Pressure..consistently 100/60 +- , blood sugar lowest it’s been (and we’ll see if it’s lower this next test, Candida seems to be gone. I know there are a lot of ways to accomplish the same thing. The key is to come up with a plan and stick to it for several months. Listen to your body but try not to overanalyze things. My experience is that it takes a long time to get things turned around."
6,Kag,195,"Thanks Michael, I will try some next time I buy some supplements. I work part-time at a health food Co-op and we have lots of different kinds. I have tried it in a gel-cap form and the liquid, both times I got reflux… smh… Maybe now that I am taking probiotics, it will be different. I am going to look that book up on Amazon. I have done a lot of research on how to kill HPV and prevent cancer from coming back. When you have carcinoma in situ as a female, it can come back at any time… It is very scary. I am doing research into anti-inflammatories such as green tea extract and also some chinese medicine ideas. I got to acupuncture and my acupuncturist has helped me a lot! I have a great lipbalm and skin cream for the itchies 🙂 now that don’t have any steroids at all! Yay! Thanks again for the story, it made me feel better about what I have gone through, although obviously, you went through much more. I have been very lucky that I have only had to have two surgeries and no chemo… knock on wood… I try to be grateful every day, but you made me feel even more so. Thank you!!!"
7,Kag,195,"Also, just for the record… A lot of women and men have Hpv and don’t even know it. It is a mostly silent disease. Most people, especially men, do not know that they are carriers. You don’t have to be “unclean” to have it. 🙂 And, like I said, although my doctor says that is what has caused my carcinoma, I always have tested negative. I truly believe that my cancer has been a result of an Std that I contracted from a man that I dated when I was very young, it has caused a lot of inflammation in the past. And guess what? The two surgeries have been in the places that suffered the most inflammation. It stands to reason that if a particular area of your body suffers from repetitive inflammation that the cells would eventually experience some kind of change. I mentioned this to my oncologist and he just said no way… He is a great doctor, but very old school."

I mentioned this to my oncologist and he just said no way… He is a great doctor, but very old school. Kag, my “not so clean” comment was talking about a different type of std (gonorrhea) and yes, definitely, both men and women can be the unclean ones. As far as me contracting HPV, I’m pretty sure the person knew that she had it (and I’m sure she was gifted it from a previous boyfriend). This was back in 2001..she made an innocent little comment about something and a few months later I went to the doctor about something..can’t remember, but he checked my urethra and found a wart..I was pretty surprised. I’ll bet, had I had a healthy lifestyle (low stress, healthy diet, reduced drinking) through the following years that I wouldn’t have had any issue since my immune system probably would have taken care of things. BUT, I’m 100% serious in saying that this situation has been the best thing to happen to me…Just with I could get some more saliva function back, but even the lack of saliva has taken me down a better path of discovery. HPV related cancers are becoming a really big deal right now. It’s one of the top cancers my ENT has said that he has been seeing. My oncologist is the same way. I’m not sure it’s “old school”, but they have a very narrow, specialized vision on things. Ya, maybe it is old school 🙂 That’s another reason I’m “eating” the exact same thing every day. As an oncologist, he has been very supportive in ordering any tests that I want ordered. He also knows about my diet. In fact, I saw him this week and was telling him about my successes including the Candida (actually, that conversation spurred me to create an account and post here). From a nutrition perspective, he’s as clueless as most everyone else. He was telling me that he’s hearing from so many cancer patients that are feeling awesome after making lifestyle and diet changes that he’s starting to look into it lol. But scientifically, I’d have to think I’m a good data point since I’ve been so consistent with my diet. You know… my ENT has slowly been opening up to me and he admitted that cutting out sugar is one of the key things a person can do to prevent inflammation and cancers. I asked him if he was telling his patients that and he said no. I also told him that the “nutritionists” that are assigned to new cancer patients aren’t doing them any favors since the diet consists of calories loaded with sugar. I totally ignored my nutritionist. One other thing I’ve noticed.. I used to get canker sores all the time. Probably 1 every two months. I haven’t had one in a year. Even with the cutback in saliva production, my mouth feels clean where before it always had an acidic feeling all the time. My ears used to never be clean. There was always a nasty crustiness that would break out into almost a rash. Now.. my ears are totally clean with nice moist skin. I think the key is cutting out bread, pasta, sugars and getting more realistic with meat portions. I’m convinced of the benefits of juicing and the fish oil (and coconut oil!) as well. I didn’t share 3 other things I overcame (or in the process of overcoming). hehe.. unreal, but this past year (it’s been a year since I started treatment) has been pretty incredible. Good luck to you and others who are trying to overcome Candida and other health problems. I’m convinced that all it takes is a real change in diet, exercise, stress reduction. In your case, don’t overthink it. Actually, the book I mentioned may help to get you more focused."

11,Kag,195,"I think it is really sad that so many of the doctors out there are basically ignoring a important link in the chain that can lead to cancer. I have read so much about inflammation now and of course, some doctors are starting to come around but I feel like it might be too late for a whole generation of us. I still have people tell me on a regular basis how bad for you coconut oil is.. smh… Oh, and another favorite, that if you don’t eat wheat and oats, you won’t get enough nutrients and fiber. Really?! If you eat a lot of vegetables, you get all of those and then some… The way that our system is set up is crazy. I am glad that your doctor at least listens to you."

0,Effcandida,196,"Hello, I was very happy to find this forum. I am a 39 yo woman whose treatment of candida has not gone well thus far. I am looking for suggestions and feedback from those who are going through the same illness. I have not felt we’ll for a long time. Digestive issues, bloating, gas, constipation, chronic sinus infections, overall fatigue. I’ve been to every doctor imaginable and have only received shoulder shrugs. I went to a Natropath last year who first mentioned the possibility of candida to me. He put me on candicin and what I now realize to be a very lax diet so I never saw any improvement. Fast forward to this year, I started seeing a functional medicine doctor in November. I did a cleanse and eliminated dairy, soy, gluten, and refined sugar from my diet. I was a healthy eater to begin with so this was easy for me to do. I was also taking a good probiotic and a supplement of oregano oil, clove and thyme. My bloating and gas did not change and I wound up with a very bad sinus infection. In January, the doctor stated that we needed a more aggressive approach to the candida and put me on the strict candida diet along with Nystatin and Diflucan nasal spray. Week one I felt fine. Week two I started to feel the die-off effects. So far, so good. The problem was that the extreme fatigue, muscle aches, and feeling of heaviness only got worse as weeks progressed. I was thankful every evening that I somehow made it through my day of full time work and being a mother to a 3 yo. Initially the bloating and gas went away but slowly it crept back. I thought maybe my feelings of extreme weakness (a flight of stairs would tire me out, even just walking to my car seemed taxing, let alone trying to parent a toddler) was due to the highly restricted diet but my doctor disagreed. He sent me to a colleague for a 2nd opinion. That doctor lowered my dosage of Nystatin and allowed rice and quinoa back into my diet. A week later I wound up with both a sinus infection and a vaginal yeast infection. Likely due to the decrease in Nystatin? I wasn’t happy with the treatment from my doctor so I recently went to another doctor. He increased the Nystatin back to the former level, eliminated grains again, and told me I could have some low glycemic fruit. He put me on quercetin, vitamin C, glutamine (sp?), and a strong probiotic. I continue to take a supplement for adrenal support and NAC. I go back in 2 weeks to review some lab work and have a gastric test done. I am bloated to the point where I’m being asked if I am pregnant. I am not sure what is causing it to be so extreme. My diet is as follows: Breakfast: one avocado, two turkey burgers, lime juice, salt Lunch: chicken and vegetables (usually cooked spinach or string beans); sometimes a chicken soup or a beef soup Dinner: chicken or fish, cooked veg (kale, spinach, asparagus, string beans).  Snacks: celery, cucumber, sometimes more protein if I am hungry, or another avocado with lime juice and salt Beverages: water or water with lemon So basically I eat a lot of protein and green vegetables. Season my food with salt, lemon, lime, ginger, garlic, coconut aminos. There is no tea, coffee, or alcohol in my diet. I don’t eat eggs so they are not a possibility for me. I have tried almonds and almond butter but not sure if that is ideal for me at this point. When I added these back into my diet (doc gave me permission as I was losing weight and can’t afford to) the bloating seemed to come back. The bloating stayed even after I eliminated them. I’ve had a bit of fruit since my new doc said it was okay. Bloating has not gotten worse or better. I cut down on raw vegetables which slightly improved the gas problem. I have no idea what can be causing the extreme bloating. I do eat a lot of protein each day. I am at a loss as to what to eat at this point in time. I also still don’t feel well. I am still exhausted although slightly better than I was two weeks ago. I get headaches, sore throats, and just an all over feeling of heaviness, as if there are weights in my clothes. I feel really weak, everything seems to be a chore. I also have been having lower back pain since I started this treatment. Is this related or simply a coincidence? Any input on this program? Any dietary suggestions? Should I not have fruit yet at this point in time? Also what are your thoughts on the Body Ecology program? I have a very strong resolve and willpower, so I will do whatever it takes to get better. I’ve been very positive but as things have gone awry, I’ve been feeling so frustrated and deflated. I just want to feel better and have my life back. I fell like this condition is so consuming and can make you mental. Sorry so lengthy. Thank you for any help or support you can provide. Wishing you all good health!"

0,Eaterofcake,197,"Hi, About 5 years ago I started notching red blotches on my penis (this happened after I got very sick with the flu and took some strong antibiotics), I thought nothing of it since they would go away usually- as time went on I started realizing I was getting constant yeast infections. If i masterbated, boom, my penis turned in to a red lollipop (and if I had a heavy night of drinking forget it)- eventually it got so bad my penis pretty much was always red and always had a funky smell (sometimes even minutes after I got out of the shower). Long story short, I took some pills and got it out of my body and I have had ups and downs with candida and every time my johnson gets back to normal the moment I even eat some ketchup it comes back a little bit and I have to go on another cleanse. Does anyone know how long it takes for this nightmare to go away for good? I can’t believe how hard it is to get back to a normal diet, I’ve probably lost about 20 pounds now after all the cleanses and cutting food out of my diet and I’m grateful I don’t have it as bad as before but why won’t this thing simply go away for good?"
1,mygutleaks,197,"i believe you need to work to rebalance your gut flora and kill it off at the same time. that’s the only way to get rid of it for good. making your own fermented foods and beverages is important. if you read this board and the candida forum at http://www.curezone.com, plus there are other good ones, like Dr. Walt Stoll’s message board from the late 90’s, you will find the answers. also, sites like paleohacks.com. Also diet is very important, you will find a ton of info on diet here."
2,Eaterofcake,197,"Thanks for the advice, but why do you think I need to rebalance my gut flora? Is it that I’m able to kill it but something is off in my gut and my body can’t fight it off from coming back? I noticed Kefir does seem to really help when I buy it from the stores, but how often would I need to drink it? Every day? I found doctors haven’t been helpful when it comes to this so any info would be very appreciated. Thanks for the links, would you be able to provide any others about specifically rebalancing gut flora?"
3,mygutleaks,197,"i think for most of us (except for dvjorge who had good flora), we got this disease, infection, infestation, whatever you want to call it, because our flora was compromised by either antibiotics or something else.. mostly antibiotics. i think this is how it goes – acidophillus bacteria produce lactic acid and that keeps your gut in an acid state. when you kill them off and they stop producing acids, the environment turns alkaline and candida, which is in your gut naturally in a benign yeast form, is able to mutate to a fungus and grow roots and permeate your gut lining. the idea is to kill off the fungus and reestablish colonies of lactic acid producing bacteria. for example, i did a CDSA 2.0 stool test and had 0 of them.. had some bifidus though. so your goal is to kill them with antifungals, not allow them to regrow – so don’t eat sugar and flour, etc.., and then eat/drink kefir, fermented veggies, kombucha, probiotics (although they are way weak I’ve read compared to homemade ferments), will help you get the lactic acid producing bacteria back in to the digestive tract. Also, prebiotics can feed the flora still in there, as it’s impossible to kill off every single one. the other task is to figure out why you have candida in the first place. do you have a malfunctioning organ, low stomach acid from proton-pump inhibitor meds, were you a heavy drug or alcohol user, do you have SIBO (small intestine bacteria overgrowth), do you have parasites, heavy metal toxicity, etc. etc. There can be a million reasons. The bigger disease is actually called leaky gut. i think one has to have that if they have fungal candida. So you need to heal that as well. According to Dr. Walt Stoll, you must have a leaky gut in order to have candida. Leaky gut can cause autoimmune conditions, etc. It takes a long time to figure everything out. My advice is to do a lot of reading. Perhaps get a CDSA 2.0 stool test, although that may not be necessary since you already know you have it. Get on Able’s strict diet and antifungals. But not til you have some fermented foods brewing. Make sure the fermented foods are all the way fermented so you don’t ingest much sugar. Oh, kefir from the stores is not what you want. It’s too high in sugars and too low in beneficial bacteria. You want to make your own. You can buy kefir grains on Amazon for $10 and find instructions all over the web. It’s wayyyy cheaper too! A week or two on the diet, and your rashes should start to clear up, or it could take longer. You may get more of them too, in new spots as the fungus clings to life. Then, just continue on the diet, antifungals, for a long time. I don’t have anything specifically on rebuilding of gut flora. Kill the bad stuff, feed the good stuff, add in more good stuff. but here are a few sites that I’ve come across and found good info. i’m still not cured yet though. and i have a mild case compared to many others.

4,Makingchanges,197,"Eaterofcake, You have come to the right place for advice…some really helpful peeps here! Mygutleaks, When you wrote this…”Also, prebiotics can feed the flora still in there, as it’s impossible to kill off every single one.” Can I ask what you meant by this?"

6,Pancho,197,"What we’ve come to refer to as a “normal diet” is really a very perverted way of eating. I don’t believe that most of us even know what a real human diet is anymore. Centuries ago, for example, “bread” meant something real, not a large soft block of nutritionless gunk that smells somewhat like bread but has no nutrients (aside from artificial ones). People eat can’d food, flavored, processed, texturized, colored, sprayed stuff in jars & cans and no longer even know (nor can they imagine) what their ancestors ate long ago. I can’t get over how people have described their idea of a “normal diet” to me! There’s so much sugar, corn syrup, “conditioners,” preservatives & colorants in so much of the “food” today, and yet we learn to keep saying, “Well, that won’t hurt me,” and every time yet another ingredient is added to our food, we say, “It won’t hurt me,” until we’re consuming a whole list of non-food items that have been added to the foods we eat — and then we wonder why we have all of these conditions? I’d say that the greater majority of people are infected with candidiasis and most of them are not going to understand or even believe that they’ve got anything that a nice drug or surgery won’t “cure.” But once one wakes up to this issue, once our eyes are opened, we see it for the nightmare it is. I’m healing again from this condition and am having to take enzymes in addition to the various things i take to kill the candida. For a time I wasn’t able to eat anything at all because my digestion didn’t seem to be working. Now that function is slowly coming back. I had the flu recently; i never get it that badly i suspect because i avoid junk food, and don’t smoke, drink or overeat. But with the flu came a candida outbreak which made my life over the past 2 months a living hell. Now I’m approaching food again with a more cautious eye. I can’t eat fruit yet; I was drinking a lot of fruit smoothies with bananas, mango, strawberry, green powder, apple juice — it was all too sweet for me apparently. And i was eating wheat bread, which i can’t do. So aside from needing to eat real foods, foods meant for the human system, we also need to “tune” our diet to our own particular body. I was getting those red blotches on my arms and getting nightmares, and just generally not feeling well. A good book on the subject would be, “The Yeast Syndrome,” by John Parks Trowbridge, MD, and Morton Walker, DPM. I don’t know if it’s in print anymore but you can get used copies at Amazon. It’s been extremely helpful for me …"

I have a new doctor ( one that actually thinks changing my diet will help) and am more motivated than ever. I definitely want to cure myself before I start a family my and just keep my goal in mind.  Today is the day. I think that instead of following the strict diet right away, I’m going to start by gradually cutting foods out from my diet and adding better substitutes.

Were you using my diet or the website’s diet when you left the forum last year? In 2012 you wrote that you had symptoms consisting of V. yeast infections and fatigue. But you later wrote that the yeast infection had completely cleared away. So do you have the same two symptoms now or have they changed? On April 22, 2012 you asked if you could go off of the cleanse you had been on for four days and start the diet, and I told you to go ahead and start the diet since you were about to go back to school, but that was the last day you posted anything at all on the forum until today. So how long did you remain ‘strictly’ on the Candida diet? And last, do you only want the cleanse or do you want the link to my diet as well? Able"

0,NewMe,200,"Hi everyone! I am just starting off with this diet… 2 days into the cleanse. I’m at a point now where I have no choice but to do this. I’ve been suffering with candida symptoms for a long time, but none were extreme enough to outweigh my love of sugar. I knew in my gut that sugar was the culprit and that I would feel so much better if I just cut it out. I was always 10-15 pounds overweight, but that increased to 30 pounds in my 20’s and 55 pounds after my third child was born. I also had 5 miscarriages between the ages of 28 and 33. This still wasn’t enough to shake me up. Then I turned 40 and it seemed like my symptoms multiplied and hit me like a ton of bricks. I started feeling like if I didn’t do something I would die! I had stiff joints, headaches, blurred vision, irritability, mood sways and a general feeling of despair. I often suffered with Athlete’s foot between my toes, but nothing that wouldn’t go away with a little cream. Then I started getting really itchy blisters on my big toe. It spread over both my feet over a period of 9 months. The blisters went away, but my feet continued to develop yellowish-white flakey skin that itch like crazy! A podiatrist confirmed that it was Athlete’s foot and gave me a cream. The cream helped a bit, but I felt like a was fighting a losing battle. My dad has really bad athlete’s foot too and has been using creams almost all his life. He now has heart problems along with a plethora or other ailments. I don’t want to end up like him! This extremely painful onset of Athlete’s foot was the symptom that finally brought me to my knees in surrender… ok, ok….. I’ll cut the sugar!! So here I am! I am determined to succeed and go through with the diet ’till the end. I am writing here so I have a place to be accountable. Thanks in advance for your support!"
1,Kag,200,Welcome to the forum! I am sure that other people will chime in on here. Quitting sugar is a good way to start! Make sure you cut out simple carbs. too.
2,NewMe,200,"Yes, I’ve cut everything out. I am doing the cleanse as prescribed on this site. I opted to do 4 days on the first option (the broth) and to continue the rest of the two weeks with option #2 (eating veggies). I’ve read all the material on the site and I’m trying my best to follow it to a T! So far so good! This is the end of day 3. My kids are gone to their grandparent’s house, so I’ve had lots of time to sleep. That helps a lot!"
3,Kag,200,That’s great! Good luck! The first part is the hardest. Make sure you look under the recipe section for recipes that you can do in the first stage.
4,RickiH,200,"Welcome and good luck! I didn’t know about this forum when I started the diet back in 2009, so I didn’t follow this exact diet, but I was under the supervision of my naturopath, which really helped a lot. The first stage is the hardest–after that, it really does get easier. And places like this one help for support and motivation. 🙂"
5,Kag,200,"Hey NewMe, I forgot to tell you that when I work outside in the summer, sometimes I will get a bit of athlete’s foot. The thing that has helps me the most, and I think would be good for you as long as you don’t have open sores on your feet is to try tea tree oil. I have had in between my toes get really itchy and red before and I swear, I use this oil and it goes away in two days max.! My Dad and brother both have athelete’s foot and they never get rid of it as fast as I do. 🙂 But of course, they won’t use the tea tree oil because it is “natural” You can even put a bit of the oil in a warm bucket of water and soak your feet in it. In face, if you do still have sores, this might be the best way to go for pallitive care until the diet starts to work. I put it straight onto the itchy places and pull my socks on over it. Anyway, something to think about if you haven’t tried it already."
0,shayfo,201,"Today is day 77 for me, so it’s my 10-week candidaversary. I haven’t been writing updates here, but I figure that since I’m bummed on the die-off I’ve been having this week, it’d be a good idea to focus on some good things that have been happening. My most pressing symptoms that spurred me to start dealing with my candida overgrowth were fatigue, brain fog, apathy, endless irritability (like hating my awesome job/house/garden/friends/pets/everything, all the time, for no discernable reason), a sort of intangible systemic feeling of stagnation (I would have drained all my blood and refilled it with new stuff, if that had been an option), a combination of sluggish digestion and a complete lack of solid bowel movements, insatiable cravings (not just for sweets, for everything), and tinea versicolor on my upper arms/shoulders. Things that I later realized are probably also symptoms: occasional acne, gnarly PMS/menstrual pain, uncharacteristically low libido, and my on-going inability to lose weight. I did the cleanse portion of the diet for essentially 3 weeks, and I’ve been on Able’s strict diet since then. The majority of what I eat is vegetables: probably 2/5 cruciferous, 2/5 leafy, and 1/5 other (zucchini, eggplant, rutabaga, etc). I also eat gluten-free oat bran, teff, buckwheat, and coconut products (oil of course, plus “manna,” flour, aminos, milk, flesh [dessicated and fresh], and homemade kefirs from both coconut milk and coconut water). I don’t actually eat the approved grains every day, but probably 5 or 6 days a week. I’ve been eating a few eggs a week since my pet hen started laying again a few weeks ago. I make and eat sauerkraut and kim chi regularly. Technically, I have cheated three times: we’re growing peas in my garden, and I’ve eaten 3-5 immature pea pods on three separate occasions. Otherwise, I haven’t eaten anything that isn’t either on the diet list or been approved through discussion on the forum. I’ve found that eating too many eggs in a day (more than four, ish) gives me abdominal discomfort. Eating a lot of the approved grains makes me hungrier and more sluggish than eating them less often. I’d been feeling like my die-off had pretty much subsided around two weeks ago, so I stopped taking MAAC every day, reducing to every other day. At this point, I feel this was a mistake. For the past few days, my tonsils have been swollen, I’ve had either a runny nose or congestion at any given moment, I have craaazy brain fog, and I’ve felt generally flu-like and tired. It seems that this may be a result of die-off toxins sneaking up on me, since I wasn’t properly assisting myself in getting rid of them. The other x-factors are that I started biotin this week, it’s been really warm out, and I went to Disneyland this past Monday. Biotin can cause die-off, warm weather in winter in Southern California means Santa Ana winds blowing pollen into my face, and Disneyland is full of yucky germy people, so it’s hard to say exactly what is causing these symptoms. (I haven’t had seasonal allergies since I quit eating gluten two and a half years ago, though, so the allergy option seems somewhat less likely to me.) Regardless of the cause, I will be pleased when these symptoms are gone. I’m back to taking MAAC every day, and I’ve upped my vitamin C from 3000mg/day to 8000mg/day to help things along. But there are good things! A lot of them, actually. My fatigue has improved somewhat. I’m waking up with the sun again, which I love, and this is normal for me. I’ve escaped the cloud of misdirected irritability, anger and apathy. I no longer have that generalized feeling of stagnation and “ickiness.” My unhealthy cravings are gone. In fact, I wake up most mornings wanting salad or sauteed veggies. My digestion is gradually improving (both in thoroughness of nutrient absorption, I believe, and in speed). My period this month was less painful and a whole day shorter than usual (!!!), which is just goddamn amazing. My tinea versicolor has flattened out completely. It was never very noticeably raised, but I can see a difference. A friend commented yesterday that it appears the spots are smaller, but it could also just be that as my tan continues to fade, the untanned spots may be less sharply visible. Brain fog (feeling easily overwhelmed, especially), breakouts, low libido, and mid-day/evening fatigue are still ongoing issues, but three out of four of those things can be die-off symptoms, and the other doesn’t really matter, currently, so I’m not worried about it. I’m also not concerning myself with my weight, which has been pretty steady since the cleanse, although I am still overweight. Overall, I’m pleased with how things are progressing. It’s a slow process, but it makes sense to me that years of bad decisions can’t be turned around in a few weeks. Thanks to everyone for keeping the discussions here alive and lively. Reading and being part of the forum helps me stay focused. And thanks especially to the “experts:” your willingness to share your experiences, research, knowledge, and (above all, perhaps) your time is indispensable. You’re beautiful! I apologize for the wordiness of this post. Brain fog makes me so much less concise."
1,alexalgebra,201,"Thanks for the post! Sorry for dragging you to Disneyland and exposing you to germy little children, LOL. I hope it was worth it 😀 Anyway, yay us! 10 weeks!! We rock, and we (and everyone else on here committed to getting rid of this shit and improving their health) are just gonna keep getting better and better as we go on our anti-candida journeys. Woo hoo!"
2,shayfo,201,"The mere fact that I was willing to go to Disneyland and risk being around wretched, germy little children speaks volumes about how improved my mental state is!"
3,Able900,201,"Congratulations, Shay. 77 days, wow, I swear it doesn’t seem like you’ve been here that long, although when I remember some of the helpful and informative replies I’ve seen you leave for other members, it makes sense. Your symptoms seem to be improving pretty much along the line of expectation in my opinion with no big or unusual problems I noticed in your descriptions. One note about your die-off symptoms which seem to be your biggest problem right now. You may want to consider purchasing a bottle of Candida by Native Remedies to substitute for part of the molybdenum amounts – if you think your die-off is going to continue or if it’s too bothersome. With the Candidate, you could probably cut the dose of molybdenum in half. Candidate works on more of an immediate basis, so I used it often and really liked its response more than the moly, but of course the liver especially needs moly during times of heavy toxins. Thanks for taking so much interest in the forum now that you’re fully familiar with the treatment and probably don’t really need the forum that much for yourself any longer. Just know that the members appreciate the time you put in here – and so do I. Able"
4,shayfo,201,"My MAAC is 500mcg instead of 250, which is why I was trying to take it less often. I’ll look into getting Candidate and then test my pill-splitting abilities with the molybdenum. Thanks for the encouraging words, Able."
5,Danny33,201,Congrats Shayfo! It’s nice to hear of progress being made. Especially for us newbies!! Good for you and Keep it up!!!!
6,Makingchanges,201,Good on you shayfo! Congrats and thanks for posting your story. Cheers 🙂
7,Ruffian,201,Awww…you made me homesick. I was born in Southern California (Palm Springs) and went to Disneyland many times with my mom. (I live in Florida now.) Sounds like you are on your way to being well!

0,monstermelie,202,"Hi everyone! My name is Melie & I found this website/forum through a friend who is currently doing the diet & she asked a question about it in a FB group we are both in. I had never heard of the diet before but knew I had some problems with yeast in the past & have a current infection that I was/am finding hard to shift so I thought I would have a look & boy what an eye opener that was. The first page I looked at was the symptoms page & I can say that I have 90%+ of the symptoms. I now realise that I have had a yeast problem most of my life. I had oral thrush infections most winters as a child sometimes twice in the year. Part of me loved it because I got to eat only ice-cream for a whole week (yup the Dr told my mum to only give me ice-cream to eat for a whole week). I saw someone mention that they had bad nose bleeds as a child. I don’t know how or if it connects with candida but I used to have terrible nose bleeds as a child too. In my teens, the oral thrush infections calmed down but I had a few vaginal thrush infections. I was also diagnosed with IBS. Before I got married, I started on the birth control injection. I had a very bad reaction to it & have pinpointed that as the start of my bad health. 2 years later I got pregnant with my first child. I suffered badly with hyperemesis gravidarium (extreme morning sickness)for the whole pregnancy & also had a lot of thrush infections. I would only be finished the treatment a week & I would be prescribed another dose of canesten. At the end of that pregnancy, I had put on 40lbs. I have never been able to shift that 40lbs regardless of diet since. In my second pregnancy, I again had HG & several thrush infections & numerous other issues that have hung around since then & that I now see are linked to a build up of yeast. Since that baby was born, I started researching, reading & changing my diet in order to try & alleviate my symptoms. The worst have been brain fog, forgetfulness, extreme fatigue, bloating & sinus infections. I also suffer quite badly from anxiety & stress (even when there is no reason to be stressed). I have also been trying to lose weight with no success. I completely changed our diet to a real food diet reducing the sugar & wheat we eat. I also took up running & spinning & other exercise & I didn’t lose a lb. Since reducing the sugar in my diet, I have been having massive sugar cravings which I find difficult to cope with a resist. I would have a homemade treat made with honey or less sugar to try & alleviate the cravings but I realise now that wasn’t the best thing to be doing. In recent months, my symptoms have been worsening. I have been getting yeast infections every month & I have had several ear infections. I have been sweating more & have a strange BO which isn’t unpleasant more sickly sweet. I also have noticed my hair is in bad condition & I have very dry skin & bad acne. And so I plan to start the diet ASAP. I am a little confused though from all the info I have been taking in over the last couple of days so please tell me if I have this right/wrong.  For the detox, the forum recommends only eating green vegetables. These can be eaten as a salad with olive oil, juiced or steamed. You can also have an egg if you feel you need it. Start the day with lemon water. The daily detox drink is that only once a day or more often? Sodium bentonite powder – is this the same or different from bentonite clay? Better made with hot or cold water? The liver detox is twice a day. The forum mentions extra olive oil. How do you take that? Just off the spoon? Then it’s milk thistle, dandelion tea, digestive bitters & the Chelated Molybdenum started 2 days before beginning cleanse. Is there anything else I need to know or take before I begin? Thank you for reading all that & I look forward to getting to know you all"
1,alexalgebra,202,"Welcome! I didn’t do the cleanse, so I’m not sure about your questions, I just wanted to say welcome and you have come to the right place 🙂 Good luck with the beginning of your journey!"
2,shayfo,202,"I would just drizzle olive oil over my steamed vegetables with some sea salt, cracked pepper, and lemon. It makes steamed vegetables more interesting, and it’s easier to get the extra olive oil intake. It sounds to me like you have a pretty good grasp of things, but maybe someone with more experience (and less brain fog today :p ) can chime in."
3,Able900,202,"Hello, Mellie, welcome to the forum.I have been sweating more & have a strange BO which isn’t unpleasant more sickly sweet.This is the odor of a Candida albicans overgrowth in a human body.I also have noticed my hair is in bad condition & I have very dry skin & bad acne.Unhealthy hair as well as losing hair and dry skin are all symptoms of a Candida overgrowth.The daily detox drink is that only once a day or more often?Up to three times a day is acceptable for a few days, then once a day is fine. Be sure your eggs are organic, otherwise you’re  jeopardizing the detox.Sodium bentonite powder – is this the same or different from bentonite clay?It’s different; you should use the sodium powder form.Better made with hot or cold water? Warm would probably allow better and easier mixing.The liver detox is twice a day. The forum mentions extra olive oil. How do you take that? Just off the spoon?Yes that’s fine. Don’t forget the sea salt every day during the cleanse. Then it’s milk thistle, dandelion tea, digestive bitters & the Chelated Molybdenum started 2 days before beginning cleanse.Considering the body odor you spoke of, you could have a pretty heavy population of the Candida, I’d start the Molybdenum Amino Acid and milk thistle at least three days before starting the cleanse to protect yoursel from the toxins that the Candida are going to release when they start dying. Also start drinking more water than you’re used to.Is there anything else I need to know or take before I begin?You asked for the strict diet in a private message, so check your inbox. Everything else is covered by the diet and the protocol which is linked in the diet. Any questions, just ask. Able"
4,monstermelie,202,"Thank you shayfo & Able. All very helpful. Will go read the stricter diet now. I’m currently trying to source the chelate locally. If not, I can defintely get it on Amazon. Thanks for all your help & I’m sure I will be keeping everyone updated as I go."
0,Vimy,203,"Hi all. Let me introduce myself. Introduction I’m male. I’m sick since October 2008. In the summer of 2008, I was doing the nightshift in a factory. Working long shifts, even 12-hour shifts in the weekend to earn as much money as fast as possible so I could start my own business. Unfortunately, I got ill because of stress and lack of sleep. I got shingles (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_zoster). I had to stop working and take antibiotics and other medicine.  The rash went away and all seemed fine. I never went back to my old job and was in the final fase of starting my own business. I was really excited!! I did had trouble with some fatigue but I thought it was because my body was still adjusting to a normal daytime schedule after months of working at night, It would get better after some time was my thinking. But it didn’t got better. Slowly but surely I was starting to lose my cognitive abilities. Starting to forget simple things, conversations, having trouble concentrating, at the same time I started to get daily diarrhea. Things got progressively worse in 2009. My business, iOS programming failed because I couldn’t program anymore. Terrible brain fog == No programming. It seems I never fully recovered from shingles, although I only made the connection with my current condition years later. I also believe I’ve struck a case of candida. In 2010, I followed a similar diet as the candida diet. My symptoms improved and my stool was back to normal after 3 months. My brain fog was lifted enough for me to go back to school. I was very social, happy. Reaching out to other people. I thought I was healed.. Student live =! healthy eating. I tried to eat healthy, yet my intake of fast food increased, I started eating bread again every day as it’s the easy option for eating a quick bite. Within one month I was back very sick, my diarrhea was back and I was becoming more shut-in every day, social anxiety increasing day by day. Yet I didn’t made the connection to my food. Anyway, now it’s 2013. School kicked me out because of my horrible grades (brain fog!!). I finally know I have candida. I also know I’m not depressed, I’m not imaging things and I wasted a whole year taking antidepressants and eating unhealthy. Emotional stuff I’m turning 25 this month. I HATE IT. My life has mostly been non-existant since I was 20 years old. What should have been the best years of my life are the worst. I’m a party person! I haven’t danced or been to a festival in years. 🙁 I’ve lost almost all my friends.. I’m 25 and still living with my parents. Something I absolutely hate. I want to be able to take care of myself! While other people of my age are busy starting their lives, partying, being social, buying/renting a house, … I’m stuck. My world currently consist of my house and a couple of streets around it.  I’m feeling trapped. 🙁 Now I’m currently following a candida protocol/diet I got from my doctor. I’m going to switch to the forum protocol, it’s more strict and I believe this forum has more experience than my doctor dealing with this sdmkfjdskdsfdsf disease. In 2010, I went three months hardcore, I followed that diet to the tee. Now, it seems I lost my willpower. It’s 7 weeks since I’m following my new diet, yet there have been 2 incidents of binge eating and setting me back. 🙁 One of them today..  So I’ve decided to try a new approach, trying to interact with my fellow candida sufferers. Maybe that will help me to stay on track. TL;DR My favorite food is french fries and I can’t eat them. Also, I love this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ5LpwO-An4"
1,Vimy,203,"Protocol I’m following now. RESTABILISATION PROTOCOL INTESTINAL –  It is essential that the use of classic antifungal and antibiotic treatments BE AVOIDED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE, as these have only a local and transitory action and merely create centres of chronic infestation. -The first 3 weeks: 2 x a day 7.5 ml ARGENTYN 23 and 7.5 ml ALOEPURE mixed in the jar attached to the bottle of Aloepure. Start with once a day for the first week. Move to twice a day (morning and evening from the second week. Still while fasting, obviously! Or, at least 20 minutes before food. The Aloepure will provide all the necessary enzymes and the reparatory and anti-inflammatory elements of the intestinal mucosa, in addition to its action of restabilising the intestines. Its polysaccharides will deliver pure particles of oligodynamic silver into the intestines. This aloe vera gel is unique as it does not contain aloin, a component of the external part of the leaf that possesses aggressive laxative effects. It simply contains the mucilage, the whitish internal jelly of the aloe vera. (Continue the Aloepure, at 20 ml a day for the remainder of the treatment and keep the bottle in the fridge.) Argentyn is a silver hydrosol with remarkable antifungal properties. “The silver colloid easily penetrates the cell walls of the yeast, thereby migrating through the cytoplasm of the yeast by attaching itself to the DNA and preventing the yeast from reproducing”. (Reference: ) + BIOFLORACARE XL: Prebiotics (3 types) and Probiotics (7 strains). Take one capsule every evening BEFORE GOING TO BED, throughout the treatment, to obtain the beneficial bacteria for optimal intestinal flora. No bloated feeling, as with FOS (fructooligosaccharides). Remarkable intestinal painkilling and anti-spasmodic formula. Effective yet gentle regulatory action on intestinal transit. Selective endogenic production of bifidobacteria, specific to the flora of each individual. + DRAINAGE OF THE LIVER with RESIUM is highly recommended, to open the emunctories and avoid any side-effect of detoxification associated with argentyn-based treatments. -The following 3 weeks: ADP, “Anti-dysbiosis product” (common oregano from Turkey, standardised extract at 70% carvacrol, in the form of a delayed-release micro-emulsion), one tablet 3 times a day with food. In this form, oregano easily penetrates the mucosa of the small intestine, without attacking the digestive mucosa. 21-day course, as with any treatment based on essential oils. Antifungal and genuine remedy for candida. Eliminates the toxic bacteria that can prevent the intestines from functioning properly. Prevents problems of fermentation and unpleasant reflux. Vital step in solving problems of flatulence, wind and abdominal cramps. -The last 3 weeks: CAPRICIN, delayed-release caprylic acid in the intestinal tract. Antifungal. 2 capsules twice a day, just before food Treatment can be finalised with GARLIC plus, garlic tablets with remarkable antifungal properties, in a concentrated formula. One month’s treatment, involving three tablets twice a day L-GLUTAMINE is recommended to reconstruct the intestinal mucosa and improve problems of food intolerance and immunity. Half a measure of powder in the morning or evening. Introduce glutamine once the bottle of Aloepure is finished!"
2,Ruffian,203,Goodluck and keep us updated. I love to know what protocols others are trying and the outcomes!
3,Vimy,203,Thank you. But I’m going to stick with the forum protocol from now on. Just posted it here for reference. The forum one seems to be better.
4,alexalgebra,203,"Welcome! I can relate to your story A LOT. I did the anti-depressants, anti-anxiety meds, which did nothing for me but give me side effects. I then started gluten free for a couple years, but eventually, I started reacting to every food I tried to eat, save for eggs and small bits of rice and veggies. It was so awful; I was grumpy and moody all the time, always tired, couldn’t think at all. I haven’t been able to work full time for years and now I just work from home. I can’t imagine trying to hold a programming job doing this (I did used to work in IT about 10 years ago). I have lost a lot of friends and don’t get out much, but the good news is that I’ve been on this diet for 78 days and life is already starting to look up! I have good days and bad days, but there are good days now. Some of my symptoms are still kicking, but most of them are on the way out or essentially disappeared. I still have to watch my activity level; I can’t do a lot of high-energy things, but I just went on vacation for a week and did 2 days of Disneyland at my own pace and was fine! That couldn’t have happened six months ago. I also feel you on the french fries, man. I literally have a tattoo of a potato on my ankle. I used to plow through fries and chips like nobody’s business. Those are my worst “act-out food”. But, y’know, my health and livelihood are more important than some stupid potatoes, so I just remind myself of that. After a couple of weeks on the strict diet you will notice the cravings just about disappear. Good luck and welcome!"
5,Kag,203,"Welcome Vimy! I think that you will find the support of others on here that very helpful. There isn’t a single person on here who doesn’t understand what you are going through. I came on here because I have a lip rash that was persistent and painful for several months. I have been on this diet twice now, I believe the first time I did not give it enough time. However, I have only had the lip rash once in the last two months! Yay! I have come to the conclusion that I will have to change my diet long term. I think that is really what the whole problem is about. I think the western diet just contains too many carbs. I love carbs and they are very tasty, but alas, they are not very good for us. I think being able to post on here has helped me keep my will power. It has also helped me when I have failed. Good luck to you!"
0,turkishdelight,204,"Hello everyone. I am now aged 55 and am getting so fed up with constantly being ill. I live in the UK where things are different to how they are in US and Canada. Since I was about 25 I had very bad sinus problems which the doctor would say was hay fever and give me anti histamines which helped a lot, though I had horrible side effects from them of feeling extremely depressed and anxious and would not take them anymore. I was then constantly put onto steroids and anti biotics and just took them. I started to get a lot of problems with feeling very heavy, worn out, lots of bad headaches. This is gradually getting worse. The doctor will do nothing at all about the headaches, brain fog and heaviness. He insists it is not thyroid and just says take pain killers or live with it. For the never ending sinus problems he has given me more and more anti biotics and steroids. I became so disenchanted with him not actually helping that I started to research my symptoms and found out about candida, something I had never heard of before. (I also used to take the pill for years and for many years have lived on a very unhealthy diet of mostly potatoes, pasta, cheese and bread). I am not into sugar or fruit really. I have started researching into this but feel so alone with it all. I have no family and my friends do not understand or “get it”. They seem to think that if the doctor says something he is a God and you just blindly listen to him so anything I say that contradicts him must mean I am wrong and he is right. I would love to be able to write to someone where we support each other. Someone who understands and is going through the same thing. I have not started to “treat” the candida yet as I have seen that a lot of people are very quick to tell you to buy this or that supplement without knowing the whole story. I spoke to a naturopath who knew very little about candida and said the solution was caprylic acid yet did not get it when I said you cannot eat just anyone and have to do other stuff too. I dont want to rush in (and waste money). But having someone who can support would be such a relief please. And of course I would support you too."

It’s important that you follow the correct diet as well as the correct treatment when you’re trying to cure a Candida infestation. As you know, there are a lot of different diets and treatments out there, some of which are very expensive. We do not try to sell you anything at all on this forum, in fact, all we want to do is support you and help you to cure your Candida overgrowth. Please read our Forum Protocol  as well as the Testimonies to the Diet and Protocol. If you decide that you’d like to try the protocol and would like to have the strict diet, please let me know. Also, we’ll be glad to answer any questions you may have now or later, and someone is always here for support. Able"
2,turkishdelight,204,"Thank you Able. Knowing you understand all this and care helps a great deal. Yes I would like to have the diet but I understand from what I have read it is not just a simple case of changing to the diet. Other stuff must be done properly too. I will read those links. In the meantime would you please tell me if it would help to chance the following – before I go onto the regime and treatment and diet properly. Most days I eat stir fry eggs with bamboo shoots, cabbage, tiny bit of carrot, onions. I try to eat as little as possible now of bread, cheese, potatoes etc and very little sugar and fruit. But I do take a lot of garlic, tumeric, vitamin c, multi vitamin, selenium and omega 3."

That’s why there’s an entire protocol which must be followed in order to reach a cure. But you can’t cure your infestation by feeding the Candida either, no matter what supplements you take. Basically, you’re feeding the Candida on a regular basis with carrots, sugar, bread, cheese, potatoes, and fruit. You’re wasting your time with the protocol and wasting your money on supplements and antifungals as long as you continue this. I’ve been through it and so have many others on the forum, so we’ve actually experienced what I just stated. Check your inbox on the forum for the diet link. Able"
4,turkishdelight,204,"I have been reading the diet since my last post. My main problem is sinus – headaches – ears brain fog and fatigue… though I know these are symptoms. I will be going on the diet as soon as I can. Is there any point to taking the garlic at the moment or does it also attack the good stuck inside me? I do not have the problems others seem to get with my stomach aching, bloating etc. How important would it be to add silymarin capsules (I read about milk thistle but understand silymarin is really the important ingredient just as allicin is the ingredient we need from garlic) , echinae, cats claw etc?"
5,Makingchanges,204,"turkishdelight, I understand your frustration with the doctor and your family thinking the way they do. I have struggled for a long time with this too. It’s very frustrating and I end up not saying too much until I am armed with more information. My journey with getting my health right has been a long one and has taken many twists and turns along the way. So, I decided to take control myself, doing lots and lots of research and keep moving on to other health practitioners to get the right answers that made sense for me, because we all know our own bodies better than anyone. Everyones candida story is different and I myself am still trying to work out how it all went wrong but I am one puzzle peice away from figuring it all out…then I can share it. It’s never just black or white for me, I am very analytical and need to know the why’s and how’s. You’re at the beginning of this journey and things will become more clearer as you go along and once you do feel better you will be able to tell your family with absolute conviction that this is what and how it is and the proof will be right in front of them. You’ll look better as well as feeling better and all will be much clearer for you.  As for the doctor, don’t bother…they don’t know how to deal with it because all they deal with is pharmaceutical drugs to aleviate symptoms…unless you find a REALLY GOOD one or a holistic doctor like I eventually did. The up side of those are that you can get treated naturally but also have any tests required done through them. They are regular doctors who have gone on further to study natural therapies. In saying that though, I do now flit between my naturopath and holistic Dr because two heads are better than one right? Then with this forums help, things really begin to fall into place and you’ll have ahaa moments. You have come to the right place turkishdelight. And one thing you really need to do is check out the diet and go and get EVERYTHING you need to begin it. Look at recipes you can use and get all ingredients for things (as much as possible) so that you can feed yourself. This will help to stop you from grabbing bad things to eat when you are feeling hungry. Maybe even start experimenting with recipes before starting the diet so that you know what you will do for your meal planning. Believe me, I wish I had the opportunity to that first. We are all here to help so just shout out if you need help and always keep in mind the bigger picture. Cheers 🙂"
6,turkishdelight,204,Thank you for your understanding and encouragement. At the moment it is this understanding that keeps me going. Most of the people I know assume that doctors are Gods who know everything and so if they do not tell you that you have candida and cure you of it you must be imagining things or making it up. How can I possibly know something the doctor does not know? This makes no sense to them. Yet I have also spoken to a naturopath who told me to get caprylic acid capsules and that this would cure me and I knew he was wrong too. Because when I mentioned to him that surely I must also cut out sugar and yeast and do other things he knew nothing of this. If I had listened to him it would have been an expensive disappointment. I am wading my way through a whole huge freezer full of food at the moment. Food I cannot eat when on the diet. Meat pies etc! I bought all of this before I realised I had candida. I am formulating my plan of diet and action whilst I wade through it and will then no longer buy such things or eat them. In the meantime I am also making sure that I eat far more vegetables than I used to and very little sugar. I know it will not cure it. I am not living in a dream world. I would love it if someone who uses this forum who would have the time would become my candida buddy where we can email each other and support each other. So that if I am tempted to give up or they are tempted to eat something they should not we support each other. In the same way that alcholics have a buddy that helps them to stay sober. Anyone interested?

8,Kag,204,"Hey turkish, I think the best thing to do is clean up your diet first. If you don’t want to do all the supplements, I think there is a lot you can do with food like coconut oil and garlic, both antifungals. It is also important to support your liver function as well. I don’t think any two people on here have the same story. But I will tell you that I think I have had a problem with yeast my whole life and just never realized it. I ended up taking a boatload of antibiotics in my 30’s and now into my 40’s for Uti’s. I never took them for anything else. I think everything came to a head when I had several bad ones in a year and had several courses of 10-day antibiotic regimens. I asked the dermatologist what she thought of the candida diet and herbs. She told me flat-out that she didn’t understand much about it. Here in the states, they can’t say much because of legal liability. She did tell me though, if it is working, keep doing it!"
9,turkishdelight,204,"Hi and thanks for the reply. I have been reading up a lot about this again today and am more confused than ever. I believe that a constant bombardment of steroids and anti biotics caused something in my stomach and this led to the brain fog, fatigue and heaviness and sinus/headaches/ear problems. Some of the stuff I have been reading today suggeests it might be leaky gut which can lead to candida and suggests a special diet for that where you concentrate on whole grains, seeds, vegetables, fruit and veg juice but can have fruit. Others suggest the GAPS diet – which is similar to the candida diet. In fact the writer said the candida diet does not work as you would be on it forever and never be cured. Before I begin any diet I want to be sure I am doing the right thing, I cannot afford to waste a lot of time and money on the wrong one. I have also been reading about people who have candida because of their fillings in their teeth and they will never get better unless they are removed – mercury? I started to take a lot of garlic a year ago. I am not cured but I am better than I was then. My sinuses / ears and headaches were so bad then I could barely move, could not work or go out or think straight at all, I was suicidal with it. One thing I have noticed which I think is important is that a lot of people go on about how they cannot have dairy or gluten or soya as if they have allergies or intolerances. or they speak of stomach discomfort, I get none of this. With me it is all in my sinus-headaches- ears – head – plus brain fog and heaviness and tiredness. Does this mean I can eat things the others cannot?"

Of course you can’t cure a Candida infestation with a diet alone. That’s why there’s an entire “protocol” on the forum, and all the members on the forum are very aware of this fact.a lot of people go on about how they cannot have dairy or gluten or soya as if they have allergies or intolerances. or they speak of stomach discomfort, I get none of this. With me it is all in my sinus-headaches- ears – head – plus brain fog and heaviness and tiredness. Does this mean I can eat things the others cannot? If you’re talking about eating dairy, soy, and gluten, you can eat it if you want to feed your Candida. The idea of a Candida diet is not to cure the infestation and it’s not about stomach discomfort, but rather to avoid feeding the Candida while you work at destroying them with antifungals and probiotics. Feeding and killing them at the same time is like sending in a new troop every day. So what’s the point of taking the antifungals and probiotics? As I was treating and curing my own infestation, I slowly reaized that treating a Candida overgrowth has a lot to do with just plain common sense. Able"

I have not had severe stomach discomfort since I was a kid; my intolerances all affected me through fatigue and brain fog more than anything else.

12,turkishdelight,204,"Thank you. I would appreciate some input on this question. As I never get bloating, gas, discomfort or pain in my stomach is it ok for me to have cheese if it is lactose free or goats cheese? Is it ok to have dairy if it is goats? Is it ok to have bread if it is yeast free or toasted ( I have heard that toasting kills the yeast in bread and cheese so making it ok) I would have thought that the rules that apply to people with a dodgy stomach are different to those with an ok stomach? Is rice milk ok? Can anyone suggest a good pro biotic and is it necessary to have a prebiotic? I am also reading about the other diet GAPS which goes on about beef broth. If this is a good idea can you not buy beef broth that is ready made rather than buying bones and making it yourself – which I cannot get hold of and am too busy to do). Most of all there has to be a time when you can come off of the diet otherwise you are not cured you are simply feeling better because you are eating healthier."
13,Kag,204,"I really think that a lot of our health problems stem from eating too many carbohydrates. We are not really evolved too eat carbs. Did you know that sugar is literally as addictive as cocaine? I think you will find if you go on a carb-free diet and continue with your antifungals and get a good probiotic, you will notice a big change. And I think that is true for a lot of people, not just people with candida overgrowth."
14,Kag,204,"Oh, and with all cheeses, if you are going to continue with dairy, you need to check the sugar content. A lot of cheeses have a pretty high sugar content and you want to avoid that. Also, they often have cultures in them that are not beneficial to people with yeast."
0,Marianne,205,"I’m Marianne from Argentina, I’m 31 and I think (I’m mostly sure) that I have a Candida problem. Since I was a child I’ve been getting flooded with antibiotics because of my ear/throat/nose problems, this might have caused the candida. I do not have fatigue or brain fog, the problem is a fetid/feces/rotten/trash smell coming off from me, this has made me very uncomfortable in social situations. Understand that I’m a young woman and when I hear people complaining about a horrible smell whenever I’m around, I seriously want to die. I take showers sometimes more than twice a day, insinuations about poor hygiene bother me. Is this the problem for some of you as well? I’m seriously desperate. I tried changing my diet with apparently no results. For me there’s no way of knowing since none of my relatives would ever talk to me about this. I think I am sometimes paranoid but sometimes things go too far when I hear them talking almost in my ear."
1,astroplane,205,"Hi Marianne, I had a similiar problem when I was indulging in too much corn/tortilla chips. My odor was primarily from the rectal area and it was bad. I eliminated corn and took caprylic acid (around 4 pills daily) and within 2 weeks odor was gone. The diet section of this website should help you learn what not to eat. I doubt seriously anyone can smell you like you think they are. Try to find a powder that is scented to absorb any odor. I hope this helps. I have other suggestions if you still need help, just ask!"
2,Kag,205,You should look into your diet I think. I had some very bad gas for a while (still have a little bit) and I think it was some oregano oil I was taking. You can be allergic to almost anything. You might want to go on what they call “an elimination diet” to see if you are allergic to anything.

0,Jezhara,206,"Hi I have just joined and wanted to introduce myself. I’m 46 and a lady in a quite stressful work environment. As a small child I was diagnosed with a severe nightshade allergy and a dairy allergy, the latter has now lessened to an intolerance. I have always been a fairly picky eater and found a lot of foods just didn’t seem to agree with me. Over the past eight years I have developed a range of seemingly obscure and unrelated symptoms. These included nausea, bloating (people would ask me when my baby was due), thick mucus in my throat, tingling sensation in my mouth, fatigue, insomnia, reflux, joint aches, dizziness, itchy anus, flatulence, red rash on my face, and sinus. I was tested for Lupus, Coeliac disease, Chrohn’s disease, sleep apnoea, had gastroscopies (postive for gastritis), ultrasounds, ct scans, heliobacter tests, blood tests, etc. Tests all came back negative but what the doctors called ‘low negative’, meaning there was something wrong but it didn’t confirm I had any of those specific illnesses or diseases they were testing for. My current GP, who seems to be quite open-minded about trying things, suggested keeping a food diary for a month and see what foods I reacted to and exactly what my symptoms were. He suggested I try a gluten-free/lactose-free diet which did help to an extent but I was still having reactions to some of the products (I have since found they were high in sugar). So we agreed I should try seeing if candida was the problem. The result – here I am. I am about to start stage one of the program. I’m quite nervous as its a big change in eating habits and going to be a bit of a challenge. But if I can start to feel ‘normal’ and human again then its worth the challenge."

0,cottle,208,"Hello Everyone. I just thought I’d introduce myself to the forum. I’m a 32 year old male, and have been suffering from candida overgrowth for a few years now. It all started with red splotches on my penis (pardon my candor), which I imagine would send any man into a panic. The oddest part was that I hadn’t had any sex in a few years at the time I first noticed the redness. I had some blood tests done, and much to my relief they showed no sign of any std. A dermatologist then suggested that my problem was subhoreic dermatits, or what effects infants as “cradle cap”. Some kenoctakazole (probably mispelled) cream was prescribed, which I used as directed for a couple of weeks, to no avail. After much internet research, I came to the conclusion that what I had is most likely a yeast infection. Went to see another general physician, and they prescribed the same cream as the dermatologist… so I now have two tubes of useless cream in my medicine cabinet instead of just the one. The more research I did, the more everything made sense… my constant fatigue, the headaches that last for days on end, the cravings for sweets and starches (especially in the middle of the night), the inexplicable mood swings, even my heartburn and stomach problems… it all fit perfectly. I did a little research on what dietary changes I’d have to make, and needless to say I’m completely overwhelmed. Luckily I date a vegetarian, so I think she’ll be able to help me with the transition to whole, natural foods. All I’ve ever eaten my whole life is junk food. Sodas all day, meat and potatoes… no green veggies or fresh anything. So this is going to be a complete overhaul for me. But I know that with the help of my girl, and the support of you all here who understand what I’m going through, I’ll be able to get myself on the right track. Curing the yeast infection has almost taken a backseat to improving my overall health, and increasing my energy level. I’m hoping I’ll lose some weight, quit smoking and learn to love eating healthy in the process. Anyways, I just wanted to introduce myself, and say that I’m happy to have found this site. I’m also glad to see other men on here discussing candida-related issues, as many people (even doctors, sadly) seem to think that men aren’t effected by yeast overgowth. It’s great to realize that a dietary change (albeit a major one) can have such a profound impact on so many physiological and mental processes. I look forward to sharing this journey with you all."

0,Cmcanepa,209,I fell off the wagon big time today. I went to a doctor for an unrelated issue and when he asked why I was taking the herbs and supplements I listed in the paperwork I told him about my candida and the diet. He made me feel stupid for going on a crazy diet for a fake problem. I know that a lot of doctors don’t believe that candida is the problem that we know it to be so I shouldn’t have been so effected by his opinion but when I got home I felt hopelessly lost and I ate EVERYTHING!! I’ve been super super strict and never cheated for more than three months and I really blew it today.  I feel like an alcoholic at an AA meeting confessing to a binge. I’m back on the wagon again tomorrow though. I’m thankful for this forum.

Hello, Lori, welcome to the forum. To answer your question as far as having brown rice every day is concerned, I’ll just say that all forms of rice are starch. Starch breaks down into sugar once it’s in your stomach. So basically; you could eat brown rice every morning only if you don’t want to cure the infestation. Also, depending on the level of your exercise, this can hinder your progress on the treatment. The success of the treatment depends on whether or not your adrenals and immune system are returned to their ultimate performance, and intense exercise is going to interfere with that. Have you read the Forum’s Protocol  and the Testimonies to the Diet and Protocol? Able"

3,LESNYC,215,"Thanks! The papaya does contain 1 g of sugar. Yikes! So, in my first week, I’ve actually had a few g’s of sugar daily. Damn! No more papaya. The discomfort in my left side is gone now anyway. Thanks for the heads up re: B-Complex. That would explain a really weird symptom I had a few months back when I was taking it on the regular. Wow! Just looked more closely at my Estrovera supplement for hot flashes. It has malodextrin. Damn again! No wonder I’m not really seeing any yeast come out! Hate to stop this but it’s worth it if the results allow me to stop for good. I think I have a very stubborn case and I’ve probably a screwed myself by taking micro amounts of disguised sugar for the first week. And yet, my die-off symptoms are large and in charge… All I can do is keep going, take out the f’ed up supplements. I’m planning to do the strict diet anyway for 6.5 months just because I’m at my wit’s end with my digestive system and hot flashes. I’ll probably even take out the goat cheese as long as my leaky gut doesn’t return."
4,LESNYC,215,"Days 7-9 ONLY eating fish, chicken, green veggies, turnips, water, green tea, sunflower butter, tahini, goat cheese.  7/10 Chlorella tablets, bentonite clay (soaked overnight). Sage enemas a few times a week. 1-4 tbs of coconut oil, 2 -3 caps of aloe+herbs, 8 drops do oregano oil, 2 moly’s, 2-3 caprylic acid tabs Wow! Still full b,own flu-like symptoms even though upped molybdenum to twice a day. Low fever, runny nose, my face hurts like right before I get a sinus infection. I pulled out my trusty neti pot for the first time in months. Definitely have to get some Vit. C today or tomorrow. I feel like my system is flooded with bacteria… Also increased coconut oil from 1-4 tbls. I have a love hate relationship w/ the oil. I’ve been cooking with it and taking 1 tbl. for 3 years. I love the taste but hate that I haven’t seen results… Upped the oregano to 4 drops morning and night. Spent many hours on the net reading through various Candida sites. There is a lot of conflicting info, which is disconcerting. If only the medical community would take their heads out of the sand and do more proper studies. I bet there’s an incentive NOT to investigate Candida overgrowth, since mysterious ailments = more money in their pockets. I did find a study about the positive effects of green tea. Good. I enjoy it cold and have always felt that it helps purge  the body of toxins. “Really interesting is green tea, which does contain caffeine but which is not a fast sugar the way it is in coffee. It gets even better: although even slow sugars are bad for you when not taken in moderation, there’s a substance in green tea which “eats” excess glucose in your blood. This way you get all the health benefits from caffeine without the glucose elevating properties of caffeine in coffee.” Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/022241_sugar_food_candida.html#ixzz2HseA1Ap8 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14688042 More controversial is Reishi mushrooms. I know for a fact, that when I started taking these last year, I saw a stream of a white substance in my urine stream initially. Sadly, I continued to eat breads/sweets and sugars with abandon. The supplement is too expensive right now, in light of all the others I need, but will probably start this again in a few months. “…mushrooms such as reishi, shiitake and maitake, all of which are non-destructive and healing fungi.” Learn more: http://www.naturalnews.com/022241_sugar_food_candida.html#ixzz2HseU3KmZ I read someone’s blog and also read Amazon reviews about Solaray Yeast Cleanse. Sounds promising and is very inexpensive. The only drawback I can see is that, IF the yeast adapts to it, there are few alternatives left because the ingredients contains most of the antifungals. The Pau D’arco tea seems to be really working. I’m drinking 2-4 cups daily. This really causes strong die-off symptoms. At least for me, when I can drink this without getting a reaction, I believe I will have gotten somewhere on this journey. I’ll also try nettles tea, ask recommended here. I cut out the Estrovera, since it has malto-dextrin. I ended up taking 1 serving of the papaya tabs, even though It contains 1 gram of sugar, because I seem to be having trouble digesting chicken. And that’s with baking it skinless with shredded ginger and coconut oil on top. My next move is to make a ginger soup with the chicken for easier digestion. Tomorrow is day 10. I’ve heard that 10 days is the average for feeling like crap. I hope that will w the case for me because I have a busy week ahead. I made a huge pot of collard greens w/ loads of garlic. Maybe that will speed things up. Collards make you move your bowels… Still doing the bentonite clay intermittently w/ oxy-mag. I’ve been doing the clay for years and I love it. I soak mine in water for 24-36 hours before drinking. Then I drink it an hour before I get out of bed, followed by a ton of water. I always have a good BM afterwards. The only problems I’ve had is when I don’t soak it first. I did see a liquid version in a protocol on another site…”Whole something or other.” Their protocol involves the liquid plus, capryol (sp) and psyllium. I’m not a big fan of psyllium… I have to check whether people w/ leaky gut should take it. I’m healed from LG but don’t want to risk a relapse."

I did some cursory research on the goat cheese and nut utters, the cheese is fine (I was just taking it for my stomach but I’m feeling like I no longer need it). Pistachios and peanuts are supposed to be the nuts to avoid. I’m limiting my butter intake to 2 tblsp a day for now. They are quick easy protein that eliminates hunger for a substantial time when I need to eat fast. I’m thinking that my hypoglycemic symptoms will abate at some point. The butters with celery are a great travel snack for the short term. I hope they don’t retard my journey….I’m in it for the long haul though. This person has a diet posted that worked for her, much more complex than mine, and she advocates certain nut butters. (Just found this). http://www.candidarecovery.com/controversy.htm"
8,LESNYC,215,"Really bumming out. I went to get the Solaray Yeast Cleanse but found that it has rice in it. I’ve heard nothing but good things about it but I really hate that it has rice. I’ve stabilized, as far as my symptoms but honestly, I have only seen yeast in the toilet 2 or 3 times. And that was only after drinking the Pau D’arco tea. I’m afraid that because I’ve used been eating a lot of sugar over the years WHILE taking GSE, coconut oil, Reishi, garlic, onion, that I’ve developed some super strain of yeast that is hard to dislodge. Is it true that the living yeast eat the dead ones? The oregano oil is new to me but doesn’t seem to be doing a damn thing. Decisions, decisions.

9,LESNYC,215,"Day 10-12 ONLY eating fish, chicken, green veggies, turnips, radishes, water, sunflower butter, tahini, goat cheese.

Moly as needed, 1,000 Vit. C or more, 4,000 D3, 6 drops of Oregano oil twice daily. Teas= 4 cups of green tea, 4 cups of nettles alternated (1 type every other day). 2-4 cups of Pau D’arco daily. Exercise= Sun salutation 3-5x a few times a week, walking for exercise a few times a week. Day 10 was my ureka day, as I had hoped. The Vit. C was a Godsend. My body was fighting so hard before that that I was beginning to get worried about the stress. Much more energy now, in fact I only get about 6 hours of sleep. I’m getting up between 4:30-5:30 every morning. I take a short nap every day though. Caved in and got the YeastCleanse. It’s all I can afford right now. I took 3 yesterday. Instant constipation. Nose started running. I popped a moly and felt better. This morning, I had a BM and popped another 3 YeastCleanse caps. I’m concerned about this (almost ) constant “clicking” in my nose and sometimes tingling in my brain. Ever since 911, (live w/n walking distance of site) I’ve been plagued with sinus issues. An MRI showed nothing unusual. A sinus specialist told me to use over the counter sinus meds. I popped those like candy for years, against my better judgement. Compromised liver/kidneys perhaps? Several courses of antibiotics, always as a last resort. Anyway, I feel like there some bacteria roosting in my sinuses. A top priority is purchasing the Swedish bitters and the LM22 (?). I just can’t afford to get any more supps at the moment. Yarrow tea was recommended & I’d like to include that in my tea rotation. Drink so much tea has really helped w/ fluid intake. I stopped 2 hormonal supps but now I’m bitchy and mean. I plan to get some Shatavari today. I used it for a few years until switching to Estrovera. It works but its vastly weaker. My ND told me my hormones are all screwed up. I took Evamist (HRT) off and on for 18 months. I’m positive that screwed me up royally. “One candida waste product produces a false estrogen, which tricks the body into thinking it has produced adequate levels, signaling a reduction of its own estrogen. Estrogen will literally feed candida growth, which is why birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy put women at a greater risk of developing candida.” http://www.sbwellnessdirectory.com/articles/smooth_transitions_Brachtl.htm What I need, most of all is TOTAL BALANCE. I’m doing a lot of meditating, energy work and sacred breathing techniques. Sometimes I feel like I’ll NEVER get better no matter what. It’s been over 5 years of dealing with this… This diet is really my last hope. As soon as I can get a read on WTF is going on w/ my pancreas, I can continue w/ acupuncture and hopefully throw in some abdominal massage. Right now, the acupuncture aggravates my pancreas. I’ve been collecting recipes. There’s a soup made w/ zucchini I plan to try. Some Teff pancakes too. People all over the net are raving about coconut flour bread. I’m terrified to include any starch carbs. I LOVE CARBS and I feel like I’ll start eating fewer veggies and get lazy and psychologically addicted. Carbs = love for me, right now. As I’m feeling quiet lonely and sad, they basically become my roommate. Maybe in a few months? Yesterday I went to Westerly and got some arugula, radishes, okra and cukes. I need variety if this diet is going to work. (I dutifully peeled the cukes.) Arugula is so delicious! Like an idiot, I didn’t get any dandelion. Raw dandelion is so awesome for your liver. It’s like a superhero cape for your liver."
10,LESNYC,215,"Day 30 today. Wow! It’s weird that today is the 30th day. I feel like shit, literally. First off, my funds are super low so I ran out of my aloe and my YeastCleanse. I haven’t had the aloe in a few weeks and I can tell the difference. Luckily, I’m going to get some more aloe in a few moments. Second, once I got on the bread kick, it was a double edged sword. In about 2-3 weeks, I’ve made at least 3-4 batches of buckwheat bread and 2 batches of coconut bread. Like a simpleton, I ate fewer veggies whenever I had the bread around. Ugg! Third, exhausted of eating fowl and fish. I just feel incredibly stuffed up. And this is with a few enemas a week. Fourth, I had to get back on my Estrovera (the support w/ the malto-dextrin). I try to take it with caprylic acid to kill any yeast that is lusting for the malto-dextrin… I also put myself on Shatavari. It’s supposed to be good for ulcers and hormones. Fifth, today, I was really going crazy for sonething naughty. It was either gonna be some yam fries, a Naked Green zveggie juice (has fruit juice), or a gluten free cupcake sweetened w/agave. Turns out I bought a dark chocolate bar sweetened with stevia. It was yucky, but I ate half. I have made the bold decision to do a liquid fast. I know the signs of needing to fast. Even though I’ve been eating massive amounts of cabbage, spinach, turnips… I just feel so totally gross. My plan is to drink 5 teas: yarrow, nettles, peppermint, Pau D’arco, green tea, water and possible a cup of fresh almond milk a day (w/Stevia?). Step up the aloe, go to 12 chlorellas a day, continue w/ the caprylic, coconut oil, moly, Vit. C/D, & other supps mentioned earlier; and do the enemas. My hypoglycemia symptoms have decreased so I’m hoping I can do this for a short while. I just need to empty out…"

The brain fog, fatigue and dry mouth I thought were a sign that I was pre-menopausal. I also picked up more than 10kg in the 6 years. It was only after finding the symptoms on this page and seeing the white coating on my tongue that I realise what my problem is. It is now my 5th day on the cleansing diet and I feel terrible. It is not so much the stuff that I can’t eat, but the stuff that I had to take that is getting at me. I almost gagged when I took the detox drink as it was a thick concoction. I now take teaspoons full of fibre and flush it down with water. I then follow it with the Bentonite Clay dissolved in hot water (I couldn’t find the liquid version). Currently I feel weak, bloated and nauseous, still tasting last night’s garlic and ginger mix even thou I brushed my teeth twice since. Yesterday I had terrible heartburn after eating some raw green beans. The only positive note is that I lost 3kg so far. I just hope all this suffering is not in vain. I can’t wait to dump the detox drink and liver flush. Any suggestion on making my life easier?"
1,shayfo,217,"Welcome! Definitely buy yourself a supplement called Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate and take at least 250mcg per day. This is an important first step. It’ll help protect your liver from the toxins being released as you’re killing candida, and it’ll help you feel a whole lot better. I wasn’t taking it when I started the cleanse (since I was also just using the website for reference), and I felt pretty terrible until I started taking it. If you have to order it online instead of finding it at a store, it will also help to start taking vitamin C (1000mg) while you wait. Here is a cleanse protocol put together by some very knowledgeable members of the forum: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst997_Proper-and-Safe-Cleanse.aspx I personally think their version is easier and more palatable than the one on the website (for instance, you don’t have to eat a chunk of raw garlic…that stuff really stays with you!). If you’re having a really difficult time on the cleanse, you can also go off it and start the candida diet (stage one). Again, the forum members who put together the protocol linked above for the cleanse have also put together a protocol for the diet, as well as a food list. The protocol is here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx and you can send a private message to Able900 asking him for a copy of the stricter diet list most of us on the forum are using.

0,Kag,218,"So, I have been on the diet again for about a month. I fell off the wagon at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I had a rash on my lips at the beginning of January. I had to use cortisone to soothe it but then stopped, I don’t like using too much of it. As an experiement, because I got rid of my chelitis permanently with it, I started using my antifungal cream (naftin 2%) on my lips every night for two weeks. I had no rash at all, but of course I was also on the diet. Today, in the afternoon, which is unusual, usually the rash only crops up in the morning, I got a bump on my bottom lip and two on my upper lip. Usually the rash attacks my lower lip first… I am so discouraged. The only thing that I have done diffently today is I started oregano oil instead of another antifungal and I had what we call a cold buster shot at the Co-op. It is comprised of echinacea, ginger, cayenne pepper and I believe a little apple juice. I have done this before with no rash. I have had no sugar, no bread, hardly any carbs, taking 10 million probiotics… I am so tired of thinking about this all the time and taking all this stuff… Does anybody out there have any advice for me with the lip rash. For a long time, I stopped using all lip products except vaseline but that didn’t seem to help. Are there any products anyone has tried that has eased the pain and/or rashes on their skin or lips. I need to know there is someone out there who has fixed this problem… And if you did fix a rash, how long was it before you did? I go in for product allergy testing on Friday, but I don’t think that is what it is… I would like food testing but have to do the product testing first. I keep thinking what a miracle it would be if it is a product but I don’t think that it is… Otherwise, why would the rash get somewhat better on the diet? Any information would be helpful or suggestions. Thank you!"

2,Kag,218,The angular chelitis went away last summer when I did my first cleanse and used the cream. I haven’t had it since. This is only on my lip area. It hasn’t ever even been around my lips. I don’t know anybody else with this problem at all.
3,Able900,218,"Hello, Katie. Vaseline can’t heal your lips anymore than anything else you rub on them; this is used only in an attempt to make them more comfortable; for example, if they’re feeling extremely dry and sore all the time. The only cure is like Raster wrote, from the inside out.oregano oil instead of another antifungal and I had what we call a cold buster shot at the Co-op. It is comprised of echinacea, ginger, cayenne pepper and I believe a little apple juiceThese are the only two things that were a change from your normal routine, so chances are very good that one or both of these are the cause of the breakout at this time. Stop taking the oil for several days in case the breakout is the toxins being secreted via the skin around the lips. Don’t replace the oil with another antifungal at this time. By the way, just because the cold-buster shot didn’t bother you at one point doesn’t mean that it can’t at another time. There are no rules with Candida albicans as I’m sure you’re aware of, other than they can and will get worse if given even the slightest chance. You’re still killing the Candida with the diet and probiotics. Able"
4,Kag,218,"Hey Able, thanks for answering… The rash is a bit better today with no intervention. I think it might have been a reaction to the cayenne. The skin on my lips is very delicate now and I wonder it some of it may have stayed on my lips for a while. I have already decided to stop the cold buster shots for a while. Although it is a bummer, because I am encountering so many sick people right now and I don’t want to get a cold or the flu! Anyway, I am going to keep trying the oregano oil and see, but since the swelling went down somewhat, I don’t think it was the oil."

Water isn’t the only natural substance which contains electrolytes. Electrolytes consist of minerals, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride and calcium. The best way to be certain that you’re obtaining enough electrolytes is to eat a healthy diet in addition to drinking water. Some of the food products that contain electrolytes are: Sea salt, kefir, spinach, Brussels sprouts, kale, bok choy, Swiss chard, turnips, collard and mustard greens, cabbage, asparagus, broccoli, lemons, limes, avocados, chicken/vegetable broth, seaweed products, vegetable juice, and herbal teas such as Nettle Leaf, alfalfa, rosehips and chamomile.

0,mike669,220,"Hello. Thank you for viewing this thread. Here is my story. Actually since I was 15 or sth like that I remember that my tongue was looking similar to that one from below article:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_tongue As you see it definitely looks much different than these from oral candidasis article:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_candidiasis Anyway, 7 years ago I went to the doctor who diagnosed that I have candida overgrowth. I trusted her, as she claimed to had the same problem few months before. I have heard that is long process so I was prepared to fight hard.  I was always eating quite healthy, but since then I got rid off sugar from my diet completely, no sweets, no chocolates, no cakes, no sweet beverages, only water, tea without sugar and so forth. Generally I started living very healthy, absolutely no junk food etc. Just healthy meat, potatoes, fruits, vegetables, eggs, milk products except milk, sourdough bread. From time to time I took some anti fungal suplements like Candida Clear + probiotics + liver support. After 6 years without any results I decided to go another step forward and got rid of yellow cheese, and I got rid of fruits + I was also trying clean hydrogine peroxide 3% with probiotics and antifungals. Still no results.  Since 3 months I eat only foods from:http://www.thecandidadiet.com/foodstoeat.htm +http://www.thecandidadiet.com/candida-fighting-foods.htm + Candida Clear, probiotics, natural kefir, natural yogurt, only ginger tea, and virgin coconut oil swishing. Of course no bread, no potatoes. After that it became even worse. Before I had actually only 2-3 circles at the back of my tongue, but now it looks more like on the picture from article geographical tongue. Last week It seem to be going in the good direction, but suddenly it became again bad, the day before all I did different is I drunk mineral water, went swimming, and few days before I reduced sauerkraut from my diet. Afterall I am very, certainly above average healthy person, I am very fit and in a good shape, I love sports, since 7 years I had a flu one time, couple sorethroat and couple times quatar. Since 3 years it seem that I have problems with sinus from time to time (I use sinus rinse).I excercise like 3 times up to 5 times a week, that is swimming, gym, tennis or dance. Except strange looking tongue, I do not have, and I did not have any symptoms described here, I feel great, I have good taste, no bad smell from my mouth, no pain (it only tweaks if I drink something spicy like ginger or if I eat garlic), I never had a headache so literally no symptoms. Now I I wonder do I really have candidasis. I would be grateful for any opinions what do you think about my situation and what should I do. Thank you!Mike"

7,d.evaeus,221,"Thank you everyone! So far so good! I am wondering about two things: 1. What are your recommendations for salt and other seasonings during the cleanse? 2. I live in Europe, ordered probiotics from iherb.com which I received only after 8 days. I wonder if they are still “alive”. Is there a way to know? Thank you Daniel"
8,Able900,221,"What are your recommendations for salt and other seasonings during the cleanse?Himalayan sea salt is best while you’re on the cleanse and treatment. Himalayan salt contains lots and lots of valuable minerals that your body can put to use during the treatment. Use pure or fresh herbs when possible for seasoning. Try not to use herbs containing antifungal properties during the cleanse, but you can start these after the cleanse. If you’re unsure of the herb, just don’t use it until after the cleanse.I live in Europe, ordered probiotics from iherb.com which I received only after 8 days. I wonder if they are still “alive”. Is there a way to know? Considering that they were shipped in January, I would think they’re fine. Able"

0,Jasmine,222,"Hi,  I am another sufferer of this terrible condition on a long and hard journey of recovery. I realized I have a severe candida overgrowth around November 2012 after reading through tons of websites online. I knew something was wrong for a while. struggling with reoccurring yeast infections and spots on my skin on my chest and back that would turn white in the sun, white thrash on the tongue, depression, digestive problems, brain fog, I had like 80% of the symptoms on those lists. A long history of systematic antibiotics ( had about 7 pneumonias from young age till my teenage years) then birth control must have completely destroyed the fauna in my stomach. The recovery has been slow and difficult .this website has been great guidance and help in those times ! Thanks you! I did a five days detox cleanse with psyllium husks and bentonite clay and veggie broth, accompanied by two colonics – one in the beginning and one in the end of the cleanse. Then I went on the diet pretty diligently for 2 months. My slip ups would be nothing too major , things like a cup of latte on Christmas sale day or a handful of toasted potatoes. The symptoms were barely reducing but I knew it would take a long time , so I was prepared for it …. Then we went to a music festival in Mexico for 10 days in January. Needless to say my diet went off the roof as soon as we landed. Tequila, tortillas, cheese and cigerettes did not help. I got over toxified on the 4th day and had chills at 80 degree weather! That made me slow down a bit. When we got back, it took me like 2 weeks to get back to pretty much where I was before we left. Which is where I am now. Back to the strict diet and the rotating antifungals and numerous probiotics and vitamins and flaxseeds and whatnot. Some days I feel great , others like crap. It is scary and discouraging reading through the stories of other sufferers online. the healing process takes a long time and a lot if efforts and means.. more often than not, as soon as people thought they were healthy, by just barely introducing one of the forbidden ingredients back into the diet would lead to the spike up of the growth of the beast right away. Apparently the monster becomes dormant when under attack from the immune system and the antifungals and discharges tons of spores which are like the candida eggs . As soon as the conditions are favorable again , meaning there is food , it spurs and it stars multiplying and multiplying until it takes over the entire body…  Dark thoughts and depression creep in , but I quickly push them away. I want to use this opportunity, this sickness to heal not only my body but my spirt as well. To appreciate the present moment, the joy from picking and preparing my own food, the awareness of my own body and how it feels and what it needs at every moment, the power to make decisions and to stick to them and resist temptations, the strength to forgive myself and accept the bad decisions as part of the process. I want to grow stronger and healthier both physically and mentally. I hope I find the strength in me to continue doing just that… I suppose, I just need to hear that this is curable. Are there any people out there that managed to get to the finish line ? Please share some words of encouragement ! Thank you!!!"
1,Jasmine,222,"I forgot to give an account of what Supplements i am taking right now/ Olive leaf extract pills first thing in the morning 3 complete probiotics ( I think 5 strains 50mil each ) A multivitamin  Another olive leaf extract pill Other antifungals that I rotate every week include : Oregano oil , Thorne research , candida clear. The diet is pretty much the one on this website, I would eat tons of garlic and ginger every chance I have. Coconut oil primarily on cooking. No fruit except blackberries and grapefruit occasionally. Slip on potatoes like twice a month , otherwise no carbs except brown rice, coconut flour and quinoa . Tons if veggies, meat primarily fish , chicken and turkey , beef very rarely . Any recommendations or suggestion to change anything? Thank you !"
2,shayfo,222,"Hey Jasmine, welcome. Most people around the forum are using a protocol and stricter diet list developed by users Able900 and raster. The protocol can be found here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx and you can send Able900 a PM to ask him for the diet list. Following it would include cutting out the remaining fruit, as well as brown rice and quinoa and potatoes. I think they also recommend eating meat/fish twice a week or less, and eliminating beef. The protocol will have information and links to information about supplements/probiotics/antifungals/etc. I hope this is helpful!"
3,moochpb,222,"I’ve been on the diet for over two months. It’s helped me feel better other then the constant bloating but it takes time. Alot of people do the strict diet which I’m sure wi heal quicker but my naturalpath said for me to eat red potatoes, and have a cheat meal once a week. As long as I’m takin my fungals and being strict 90% of the time I feel ok. I eat chicken twice a day and I don’t get a reaction, antibiotic free chicken. I eat beef once a week and even rice pasta once a week. But if symptoms are not good do the strict diet if you can for sure"
4,alexalgebra,222,"The way I think about is…this has been a nightmare and I want out of it, so if I minimize the amount of mistakes I make (nobody is perfect, I have definitely made a few!), and stay as strict as possible with the diet and protocol to the best of my ability, I will heal faster and be healthier in the end. Whenever I go shopping or prepare a food, I just have to think to myself, “What are the healing properties of this food?” If the answer is, “None,” then I know I shouldn’t be having it. I abused my body quite a bit with alcohol, drugs, and garbage food, and now I have to fix the damage by putting in medicinal food only until it can handle occasional other things. The cravings and temptation also have reduced quite a bit after being strict for over 40 days."
5,Kag,222,"I had a very wise counselor tell me at one point in my 20’s, it took you 20 years to get here, it may take that long to get well. I am not trying to be discouraging but most of us are here from years of eating the wrong things or having to take too many antibiotics or both. It will take a long time to heal your body naturally but I believe it can happen. The hardest part for me is knowing that I will never be able to go back to my old diet. I loved bread soooo much! But still, it is better than being sick… Try to imagine how great it will be when you feel better! I am already noticing a little bit of improvement. The thing to remember is when you do things naturally as opposed to medicinally, it takes a lot longer. So as the Chinese say, it is the three P’s, Patience, Patience, Patience. 🙂 Sending you good thought and hugs dear! Katie"
0,Softlad,223,"Hi All, first post after one week on diet:- Whilst I have adhered to the diet I have allowed myself to have pork, fish (including prawns), decaffeinated coffee and Chilli’s as I believe that whilst it is advised within the diet that these are “not good” they will not be detrimental to my regime. (I have also had beetroot in one meal by mistake!) My Regime:- Prior to gym (Mon – Fri), one pint water (with medication (including 1000mg fish oil and 1500mg Glucosamine)) and half pint dissolved wheat grass powder. Breakfast (After gym Mon – Fri) 500mg Caprylic acid and 1 antioxidant tablet  Natural yoghurt & one boiled egg. Two mugs decaffeinated coffee Lunch:- Depends upon day, I have had varying Mediterranean salads with either boiled eggs, tuna or other fish, chicken, plain omelette with tomatoes and onions or home made chicken and broccoli soup etc. All accompanied with much Garlic and olive oil (infused with chilli flakes and garlic!) Evening and weekend Meals:- Varying Mediterranean salads or roasted vegetables and once per week (Friday) Brown rice, accompanied with any of the following; Fish, Pork, Lamb, Chicken (including tikka) and Chicken Jalfrezi curry (with lots of fresh green chilli’s) for Friday! All meat and fish is BBQ’d apart from whole chicken then roasted in oven or on spit. All accompanied with much Garlic and olive oil (infused with chilli flakes and garlic!) Snacks:- Celery sticks and occasionally yoghurt. Have had headache since day two but other than that have felt pretty ok. Today I have just introduced probiotics. Since starting diet I am not as “phlegmy” as normal, finger joints still hurt but my knees feel a little better. I have managed to “cure” face rash which was pretty bad and progressively worse over the last 18 years or so, I now wash whole body every day using Head and Shoulders in shower. My skin is really good and have not had flare up in about three – four weeks. (Last one was really bad) The thing I really, really, really miss is, RED WINE! (and the odd beer! Anyway, enough already, must work! Regards G"
1,Softlad,223,"Hi All, after week two:- Still have headache!!!!!!!! Not had any real “Die Off” symptoms and feeling ok! I have introduced the probiotics and a second 500mg caprilyc acid tab’ of an evening with meal. (This takes me to 1000mg CA per day). Diet:- basically same as last post. I have chilli cravings at the moment! I seem to be having them in most meals, either fresh or dried. Also Garlic, just can not get enough of that stinky stuff! Still they are good for the Candida! Food is not bothering me at all! I like the salads and meat etc. New addition to my diet is home made chicken and broccoli soup for lunch (Lashings of onion, garlic and spiced with chilli’s black pepper etc). Again, thing I am missing is RED WINE! Rash:- Since discovering washing in Head and Shoulders shampoo, my face rash has not come back! Result in my book. (I would urge anybody who suffers from facial or other candida related rash to give it a try, works for me and my rash was BAD!) Until next update Regards G"
2,Softlad,223,"Forgot to add, I have not had indigestion or reflux since starting diet! G"
3,Guest,223,"Huh, interesting. There is alot of people that say the same thing about H&S schampoo. As far as i know there is a substance in it called zinkpyrition that seems to be common in things that treats eczema and psoriasis etc. It seems to be a substance that you can find in paint too (to paint boats for an example) but we aren’t allowed to use such paint because it’s toxic. Hmm?"
4,raster,223,"One thing we do not recommend on this forum is eating pork, which takes days to digest, while chicken and fish take hours to digest. Basically if you eat pork, you will be constipated. Additionally, we don’t recommend brown rice because its high in starch, contains some sugar, and is inflammatory. If you rely on it everyday as a food item, this can potentially set you back from my experience. Buckwheat is a great alternative because contains only 25% starch and is a prebiotic that feeds the beneficial bacteria in the gut. Similar texture and taste as well! Also, the coffee can be a big problem while on the diet because it is inflammatory, promotes leaky gut, drains the adrenals, and damages the liver and kidneys. Even though it is decaf, it still contains caffeine. Additionally, it is high in molds because it is a dried food item. How much sugar is found in your yogurt per serving? Wheat grass is also something I would watch over time and see if you feel better with it or without it. The chilis are moderately inflammatory as well so be careful! http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2767/2 We developed a general plan to get better if you are interested; http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx -raster"
5,Softlad,223,"Hi All, “Fell Off” Last Night! Two glasses of that Devil red wine got me! For my sins I had a thick head this morning, serves me right. (Never normally have a thick head after two glasses of red wine! God must be punishing me!) Anyway back on track today. Katyliss, thanks for the post, yes you are quite correct H&S does have Zinc pyrithione in it, it has antibacterial properties, is (as you quite correctly pointed out) used in paint for its algaecide properties, household sponges etc and more importantly used to treat dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema, ringworm, fungus, athletes foot, dry skin, atopic dermatitis, tinea, vitiligo and (very successfully) my face rash! I understand where you are coming form re the toxicity in every day products but this stuff has been around for a long time, in its industrial form it is harmful but in over the counter products I do not believe that it poses a great risk. (Just my opinion) Also if it cures my rash I am willing to take that chance. Raster thanks for your input, re pork, totally understand where you are coming from, yes it does take longer than other meats (and fish) to digest, (4-4.5 hours) and if you eat lots of it I can believe that it can make you constipated and has bacteria that may be damaging to you if you have reduced immune system, thankfully both not applicable in my case! Brown rice, is recommended on the diet on the website. I agree if you eat it every day may be a problem but once per week? Coffee:- I can not see that two or three cups of decaf’ per day can significantly affect the growth of candida, I have fresh ground decaf’ (from beans) I understand that it may contain minute traces of caffeine but so do “Brassica vegetables” :- cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts etc. Some diets say you can have coffee others no. I believe that this regime is hard enough as it is and anything that may facilitate it being easier is, as I am sure you will agree, a plus. Yoghurt:- No added sugar only natural occurring which, at the moment I do not know the quantity as do not have pot to look at! (All eaten and empty pots thrown away!) I generally have 1 – 2 pots per day. Chili’s;- I always believed that they were anti fungal (included in stricter diet). I do not understand the inflammation risks with certain foods but will look into it. Wheatgrass, Jury is out on that one, do I feel better or worse taking it? I do not know for sure but if it has lots of vitamins and boost immune system (Not proved) can not be a bad thing. I have it prior to going to gym to kick start my body prior to exercise. Since starting the regime, as I have said previously, I have had a headache (aside from todays!) other than that I am feeling ok. I have lost a little weight, I am enjoying the food! and generally feel better than I have for quite some time! My rash has gone and I believe, as I am sure you will agree, this is all positive! I would also like to add that I think this website and its members are a great resource for knowledge, advice and support, many thanks! Regards G"
6,raster,223,"Drinking coffee contributes to the problem and not the other way around, its likely one of the reasons you are here in the first place. Its hard getting away from it cold turkey, but you will heal much faster without it from my experience. Why do you drink it? If you want something that will promote digestion and perk you up, I recommend trying chamomile tea which is antifungal and promotes bowel movements. If you steep it longer than 8 mins, it will give you energy. Its also good for the liver. Chickory coffee is also something to look at, its a a prebiotic that feeds the beneficial bacteria in the gut. If you want to reverse the flora in your gut, it will be more difficult while consuming coffee. -raster"
0,smithsonian,224,"Hi all I am a journalist working on a story about my battles with what I suspect to be Candida – and I’d really appreciate some advice from those in the know (as it’s quite frankly ruining my life and making me very miserable!). Apologies in advance for the length of this post. A little history: too many courses of antibiotics over the years, sugar/carb-filled diet, yearly bouts of thrush, fungal infections in the groin, pitoriasis versicolor, fatigue, brain fog, constant tongue problems, memory worsening, recent feelings of depression etc. I travel frequently to third world countries due to my work, so eat a poor diet and don’t get enough rest. I’ve always got ill a lot and had a weak immune system. I was (until recently) a sugar fiend and could buzz through a giant bag of sweets in minutes – plus, I’ve abused my body with alcohol severely down the years. About a month ago, I decided I had to get to the bottom of my problems, after a year of stomach problems and one particular bout of thrush which lead to my scrotum and penis becoming very red and sore and severe tingles down my legs and in my buttocks. Cue all manner of tests at the doctors which so far have come back with nothing. When I mentioned candida as a possible cause, it was pretty much dismissed. However, my sister suffers with it badly and has been diagnosed. I believe my symptoms all point to candida, though I have had no official confirmation. So…to the treatment which as been wreaking havoc on my body. After the initial problems I went on a course of Fluconozole, which led to terrible patches and growths on tongue. I also came out in a rash on my chest and face, got itchy eyes, shivers all over and tingles down legs got worse. I then decided to cut out all refined sugar, alcohol, caffeine, yeast-containing foods, dairy etc. However I must admit to not following the diet to the letter of the law and still allow myself the occasional potato/rice dish, ketchup etc. I have upped my intake of garlic, probiotics and yoghurt and also got Yeast Raiders from Holland and Barratt (has anyone tried these?). I use aloe vera for skin flare ups and salt water for my mouth, plus epsom bath soaks. Over the last couple of weeks, the tingling all over has got worse and is particularly noticeable after taking the supplements – especially down my arms and in my hands, even in my eyes. My skin is flushing a lot too and I have rashes in the skin folds of my stomach. So..I’ve cut down on the supplements a bit. Today, my tongue is bad again and it looks as though infection has spread to my throat. Lips: red, especially in the corner, hands freezing and tingling. Whilst the tip of my penis is still red, the itching around my groin etc is not so bad. I’m worried that I may have caused nerve damage with the Fluconozole or had a bad reaction to it. Could these symptoms really all be related to die-off and detox effects on my body? Could I be allergic to substances I am taking? Or am I not killing any off and I simply have a severe case of candidiasis? It’s been about three weeks now and it’s like a lottery every time I wake up…what will the next reaction be? I’m also desperate as this could affect my ability to travel with my work. My immune system feels shot… I’d really appreciate any help and advice!"
1,shayfo,224,"Hey, smithsonian. It sounds like you’re probably having really terrible die-off because your liver and immune system are so shot. Most people who are regularly on this forum are following a protocol and diet list put together by users Able900 and raster. The protocol is here: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx and you can send a PM to Able900 to get a copy of the diet list. It’s pretty comprehensive, and there are good links on the protocol thread to information about supplements, antifungals, probiotics, etc."
2,smithsonian,224,"Thanks so much for getting back to me. Do you know anything of these Yeast Raider tablets? They contain: Fibre Blend (Psyllium Seed Husks, Guar Gum, Apple Pectin), Dicalcium Phosphate, Capsule Shell (Gelatine), Anti-Caking Agents (Stearic Acid, Silicon Dioxide, Magnesium Stearate), Barberry, Odourless Garlic Extract, Vitamin C (as Ascorbic Acid), Lactobacillus Acidophilus, Proprietary Blend (Pau Dâ€™Arco, Onion Powder, Black Walnut, Echinacea, Goldenseal), Zinc Oxide, Ginger, Thyme, Cinnamon, d-Biotin, Sodium Selenate."
3,shayfo,224,"I don’t have any experience with them, but I do know that both of the knowledgeable forum members I mentioned above advise against using barberry, goldenseal, or any other antifungal herbs containing berberine, since berberine can destroy good gut flora and damage the intestines. Apparently, it can also deplete minerals in the body, and is linked to raising blood pressure. I would be somewhat suspicious of any supplement that combines fiber, antifungals, probiotics, and vitamins all in one tablet."
4,smithsonian,224,"Hmm, thanks – you’re a star. That was the impression I’ve been getting from others! 20 quid down the drain 😉 Sorry, one more question…are my symptoms normal: tingling all over, in hands, eyes, face, groin, rashes, exacerbation of existing symptoms etc? If this is die-off, I don’t like it much!"
5,raster,224,"These are pretty normal symptoms. I would check out another thread from yesterday in regards to what to do to get better: The rashes are pretty abnormal from my experience, because I never really got any. I believe you are possibly overloading your liver. Many other users experience these symptoms though… http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6450_Need-encouragement—17-weeks-into-treatment-and-still-so-bad.aspx The body detoxes via a few basic methods, via the skin, the lungs, and the bowels (filtered by liver and kidneys). If your liver and kidneys are not working properly, your body may detox via the other methods. -raster"
6,shayfo,224,"Like raster says, people have different symptoms, both for infestation and for die-off, and rashes can be one of them. I agree that it’s probably because your liver and/or kidneys are overloaded with toxins. When you kill yeast, they release toxins…so when you kill a LOT of yeast, they release a LOT of toxins."
7,smithsonian,224,"Thanks for this guys. Rasta – I have been reading in depth about Chronic atrophic erythematous candidiasis. I believe this may be what I have…the red, burning testicles and top of penis that have been here for weeks and respond to no treatment. The tongue patches and skin on my mouth that literally wipes away and appears inflamed all the time. The constant skin eruptions. What do you know about this condition? Is it treatable? And is it contagious?"
8,Jujublue,224,"Smithsonian, I feel your pain the skin rashes from Candida have completely derailed and devastated my life. They are miserable and mine increased like crazy as soon as I started tackling the problem. On a positive note, after 17 weeks of faithful treatment/diet my chest, arms, hands and neck look a ton better, but my poor face is still taking a beating. Raster brought up our livers being stressed as to why our skin is the dumping ground of choice for the toxins, I agree, I have had to be on anti seizure meds for the past 23 years and my liver was very congested. Two months ago I took up the daily habit of coffee enemas to clean my liver and have gotten out literally hundreds of stones, now my liver seems to be really clean but I’m still having skin issues. Coffee enemas are not for everyone but I follow the blog of the Wellness Warrior of Australia for coffee enema info (and more) she’s awesome! Anyway, combating this illness is a long journey, I wish I could offer you more comfort and say that this doesn’t last long but it’s the kind of thing that takes 110% commitment to get better and yeah, it lasts a long time and kicks your butt physically and emotionally. This forum is helpful not only with information but support from fellow sufferers/survivors. Best of luck, I hope things go well for you."
9,Kag,224,I don’t know much about this disorder yet but aren’t there things you can take to support your liver and make the die-off not so bad? I read something on here about that but don’t remember what it was. Able would know. Katie
10,Kag,224,"Oh and I forgot to mention, I use a tea tree oil mouthwash. I have a problem with an intermittent rash on my lips and I find it is great for that. It is also very nice for your breath. 🙂 Katie"
11,Able900,224,"Hello, Smith, welcome to the forum. A couple of “Don’t” for you first: Don’t take the Yeast Raider tablets at all. The first clue that this is a faulty supplement is the fact that the company has combined antifungals with probiotics. Common sense dictates that you can’t combine these two simply because the antifungals will destroy the bacteria that the probiotic contains. It also contains berberine which should be completely avoided. Don’t do coffee enemas as someone suggested; over time this will only weaken your adrenals even more so. Don’t take anymore antifungals until you’ve started Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate and have taken it for three days straight, then you can start back on whatever treatment you choose. Drink lots of water and take either saunas or soak in hot tubs of water to help remove the Candida aldehyde toxins. These are causing a lot of your problems right now. You would benefit from reading the protocol which most of the members are following. If your immune system feels “shot” as you wrote, that’s because it is. The protocol and diet are designed to heal the immune system and the adrenals, as well as the Candida overgrowth and leaky gut syndrome. Testimonies to the Protocol  The Forum’s Protocol  Able"
0,michaelibre,225,"Hi everybody, Since I discovered the website and being sure I have a Yeast overgrowth for 5years now, probably candida. I have strong palpitation when I eat a bunch of bananas or other sweet fruit and can not do real exercise. The only moment I felt better has been when on orange Juices for a week or so but lost weight. I have often fungi overgrowing around my penis although I cleansed it rigorously. I did for 2 weeks, only: 3 heads of cabbage a day with lemon juice, garlic, ginger, and at least 2 soup spoon coconut virgen oil per cabbage. 10 radishes per day 10 cucumbers I had some avocados at the beginning but it didn’t feel so nice finally, it is normal candida likes avocados??? So when I have a lot of coconut oil (some website do fasting and taking 2 soupspoon each hour, up to 14 soup-spoon a day of coconut oil) I feel quite strong pain in small intestine, I suppose this is good sign and die off, isn’t it?? Today I had some really bitter medicine herb but it was mixed with honey and I didn’t know neither noticed it so bitter the herb was. Result, after 2 weeks strict diet, just a little honey and stronger than ever palpitation, horrible feeling for 2hours…. Ahh this feels hard…. what’s about the Orange Juice fast, or coconut water (i’m living in costa rica, really easy to obtain)??"
1,alexalgebra,225,"Pura vida! There is a strict diet and protocol for candida that you can get from Able – just send him a private message. I would recommend trying that as best as you can in Costa Rica. It is mostly veggies which I think you should be able to get there just fine. Avocados are on the list! Oranges and honey are both a definite no for candida – they are both sugars that will feed it. If you can find something called Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate, that will help with the die-off symptoms tremendously! It has been a godsend since I found out about it. The coconut oil is a great antifungal and so is raw garlic. I put up a recipe for a soup that uses both (feel free to add more than is in the recipe), called Bieler Broth, on the recipes page, which is safe for stage 1 of the diet."
2,michaelibre,225,"ok, thank you for your answer and recommendations. I read through the whole website and it is clearly writen that avocado is good but could it be otherwise for me? IS there another tuff fungi other than candida? I will soon receive Milk thistle from a friend who is bringing it me from the US as it is hard to get it here and expansive to ship it. How can I notice some relief and how much time should it take??? I will contact able, thank you Michael"
3,Danny33,225,"Try to cut down on the fat in your diet a little and see if it helps. Just try excluding avocado, fatty cuts of meat, salmon, oils and nuts from your diet for a week and see how you feel. I too have had negative effects from high-fat foods."
4,moochpb,225,"Cut out the avocados for now, no honey, no oranges or orange juice. Cut down on the coconut oil if stomach pain occurs. See a naturalpath or look at the protocol here. Get some other antifungals. Good luck"
5,michaelibre,225,"I’m already not really strong and quite skinny, if no fruit, no avocado and no fat than I will disappear…"

Trust me, I understand – I lost like 15 pounds…from around 130 to almost 115…I am pretty much skin and bones right now, but it’s stabilized since I added back in coconut bread and I think I’m maybe starting to gain back a little."

0,Guest,226,"Hi. This is my story 🙂 I have a history with constipation and stress, i tried to get help but nothing would work on my iron stomach for some reason, i even had a hose down my throat but they couldn’t see anything wrong in my stomach. I was eating a lot of gluten back then as they said i should eat a lot of fiber, i loved my coffee and took my own made cup cakes to it from time to time. Little did i know what was going to happen in the future. Two years back from now…. I suddenly got this food intolerance and red dry skin rashes, every time i tried to eat something, anything, it would crawl under my rashes and itch, it was painful and made me moody. I wasn’t myself. I lost a lot of weight too. I have been to the doctor. I took a blood test, urine sample and made a allergy test, when the results came back they said i was healthy as a horse, again. They didn’t see the slightest deficiency, even though i was loosing weight and only had one food source left at the time. I didn’t have any allergic reactions to gluten etc. They didn’t say anything about my rash even though i asked a couple of times and they seen it get worse by time, they just gave me something new to put on so i could feel some sort of relief. They didn’t want to do anything until i tested it so they just sent me home with a smile. As usual when something doesn’t show on paper, it’s all in your head. I was depressed so i started to work with myself on my own. I got rid of gluten, milk products, starches and all the sugars i could think of. And even eggs, o boy do i miss them. I am a runner so i had to stop running for a while too because of my rashes couldn’t handle it. I wasn’t really concerned about my weight though. I guess my body needed the rest, specially when i couldn’t eat right. After two years…. Thanks to herbs, silver water, pau’ darco and some kind of “diet” with clean meat such as cow and chicken, vitamin c, lettuce, avocado, cucumber, onions sometimes, wild flowers in my salad in the summer and my own made teas i feel better, i am much happier now. Someone told me to try coconut oil in my diet as well. WOW, i got the worst die-off i ever felt. I used it as a moisturizer too, my skin went crazy. A woman told me i shouldn’t stop as the coconut oil was cleansing my skin, it gets worse before it gets better, she said. Okey, i thought that i already looked like a pizza face little did i have to loose, so i continued with the coconut oil, and she was right, it got better. I also use organic shampoos and stuff which gives me relief. I have not cheated once, i never felt any cravings, i am just so disgusted by everything. So now, i am still constipated, i still have some of the rashes left even though it’s moderate now and don’t itch much or anything, and i still can’t eat much vegetables in the stores. Things i would like to be able to eat is peas, broccoli and cabbage but it gets too much for my stomach to handle. The things i avoid and don’t care much for is corn, potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, carrots and paprika, it might be the starches, pesticides the sugars cause they make my body go haywire in a very negative way, which peas and broccoli don’t, for an example, it just gets too much. I can also forget about fish and shrimps. Fruit, that’s a big no no. Wild berries is okey, i only take one or three, this is something i don’t do often, only in the summer. What on earth have I’ve been through, did i develop an autoimmune disease? Candida? I have never thought about probiotics. I started to eat my own made sauerkraut very recently as some say it helps against constipation and gives probiotic, kefir is nowhere to be found here and milk products are useless so this is all i got that is natural, for now at least. My skin had a slight flush at the beginning and i got a bit of acne, not much, just some few bumps, that’s all. I am not bloated, windy or uncomfortable. This is the same reaction i get for eating probiotics in capsules. I even get the little flush from caprylic acid capsules and coconut oil, it makes me a little nervous so i stop eating it, after a little while i eat it again. Should i be worried? Or just go for it? Although since i started to eat the sauerkraut it feels like my skin isn’t as dry as before. Is probiotic cleansing in some way?"
1,klips32,226,"Dear Kateyliss, All I can see are the very similar symptoms that I suffered with over the years. The very best advice I can give you is a complete approach against an overgrowth of Candida Albicans in the GI track. There is a protocol found on this forum, which explains what to do. Besides, you’ve done loads of good stuff beforehand and you might have it easier from now on compeered to other who just starts a fresh treatment against c. albicans. Kefir: You can get it from http://www.hjemmeriet.dk. caprylic acid capsules and coconut oil: Keep taking it if you’re not going to make a cleanse (also described in the protocol). The nervousness is die-off reaction, had it many times before, it’s normal, but be careful, read the protocol. If you do this right, you’re problems will disappear."

I shall continue to take the coconut oil and the caprylic acid capsules and take a closer look at the protocol and see what i can do.

4,raster,226,"Hello Katey, I would check out this post about HCL and general health (including skin health). Dr. Mcoomb’s feels that anyone who is has skin problems is likely deficient in HCL (hydro-chloric acid). http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6027_Hydro-chloric-Acid-and-Health–written-by-Dr–McCoombs.aspx Additionally, it sounds like you have untreated leaky gut (holes in your intestines that have caused you to be allergic to everything). This takes a long time to heal, but basically you need to reduce the inflammation of your gut by eating an anti-inflammatory diet (and supplements), chewing your food well (30 times+ per bite), and feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut with prebiotics and probiotics. Other supplements help heal leaky gut and promote digestion as well (for instance, swedish bitters). It sounds like you are experiencing die-off from antifungals which means you have a fungal, yeast, bacterial, or other infection and your liver is being too taxed to handle these toxins. A person with a healthy liver should not feel deathly bad from taking antifungals. It is best to supplement yourself with liver and kidney supplements to protect the liver while taking antifungals; examples include chelated molybdenum and milk thistle. The coffee has made everything worse and promotes your health negatively. Are you still drinking coffee? It is strongly inflammatory, promotes leaky gut, and drains the body. Your experience is similar to what many of us have gone through and now you can start healing. -raster"
5,Guest,226,"Wow. Thank you Raster. This was new to me, i sure have a lot to dig in to now. Tough to hear that it takes a long time to heal but at least i know, thats far better than not knowing anything. No. I haven’t had coffee for about four years now. No more coffee for this lady. It has been easy to leave every bad habit behind, although it’s not as easy for the people i know as it is a social thing to eat and snack together and they wish for me to be able to eat all that stuff again. It’s a bit weird and i haven’t got totally used to it yet and it gets a bit overwhelming at times as they don’t have a clue about what candida is and what it does. I guess I’m not the only one that has gone through that either. It shall be interesting to hang around and learn more about these type of things as you here seem to know so much. It should be in every peoples interest to know about food and health."
0,klips32,227," Hello all. I’m turning 25 this month, feeling my youth is fading away only to be replaced be an overall horrific disease, where no doctor will/can help. Since I don’t get any better, I will try to list down the stuff I take and eat. I’ve been having symptoms since childhood, always very sensitive to all factors that relates to a fungal related disease. Overall, it seems that I’m very bad at fighting my own endogenous yeast, never could eat the ”unhealthy” stuff other kids could. After taking broad spectrum antibiotics in summer 2010, my symptoms (both physiological and physical) exploded, found out it was some sort of fungus summer 2011, got treated with Diflucan (fluconazol, systemic antifungal drug), after 1 month diet and medicine I was feeling better then I ever had before in my life. Due to lack of knowledge (my own and doctors) diet and medicine was discontinued.  For 2 years i have been fighting C. Albicans/ore related fungus, with different anti-fungal medication, diet and now probiotics. I’ve managed to be completely symptom free some periods (weeks), but every time a new drug introduced or, as it was the case last time I got better, a first time introduction of a probiotic – the fungus comes back, more resistant and aggressive. I can not get any real help from my ordinary doctor, he agreed to prescribe most antifungal drugs for me, but has no real knowledge of this kind of infections. Bear in mind, that I had these symptoms since childhood, and some of my family members had/have them too, getting worse in damp hot weather and everything that comes with a fungus related disease. My own theory is a genetic disposition from my mothers side of the family, but this is only theory. I’ve been tested summer 2011, stool, blood works, everything. It was summer, very dry for weeks and I had been in good health for some weeks (what a great time btw), actually I really tried to eat some wrong stuff, not to bad, but loads more of starchy stuff. All test where negative, I was in absolute good health they told me – And I was, until some rainy damp summer days, all hell broke loose again. They can test me again through my own doctor, however, their treatment is purely drugs (I think, don’t actually know. In my country C. Albicans is treated with antifungal drugs, diet is completely unnecessary). My thoughts on this is that my own treatment is better then theirs, call me naive, but had so many bad experiences with doctors on this topic. Here is the things I take. I’ve been on nystatin the most of the time. I did stop taking medication 3-4 times hence many doctors had me convinced that there is no such thing as an overgrowth of c. albicans unless I was immunesupressed. Every time I stop, I get worse, especially on rainy days. Medication: 2 nystatin pills after each meal. 500.000 i. e pr. pill 1-2 Multidophilus pills between each meal (each contains 1-3 billion L. Acidophilus and 2 other beneficial batceria stems, same quantity pr. capsule) Brentan gel, oral. Antifungal drug for oral use(contains sugar! I get a lot of exemia from this, really bad) At this time: Itraconazole, for systemic use, 1 capsule a day, 100mg. This is for 30 days only. They only help 2-3 hours, and makes the fungus more aggressive. Vitamins and minerals: Normal multivitamin and mineral pill Vitamin D Vitamin C Sometimes omega 3 Thinking about to get some biotin(vitamin H) to use with the probiotics, has the same effect on c. albicans as olive oil, prevents the fungus to convert. Food: Strict candida diet food. Loads of the green stuff. I really don’t want to list all the stuff, but the diet is the very thing I managed good on this. Nu sugar, only few complex carbs and so on, you all know the drill. Note to food: 1. I may have the condition ”fructose malabsorption”, family member has this. I don’t eat stuff containing large amounts of fructose (diet related: onions, coconut). 2. .……This is a very important one: I do not eat garlic, ginger, cinnamon, liquorice root, ipé roxo ore any other natural candida fighter that also kills bacteria. And there is a very good reason for this; The first year on diet, i ate a lot of garlic, fresh onion and oil of oregano. I helps like fluconazol does, good at the beginning, but the fungus returns after ½-1 hour, aggressive. In addition to this: I diddent eat any probiotics. My candida gets worse from most stuff that contains lactose, therefore I did not eat yoghurt. (note: I have enough lactase enzyme in my gut, tested). After I quit using most of the anti-fungal/antibiotic food i got better. Now I can hardly eat any garlic (½ clove a day, every second day). Every time I overdo it with that kind of food, even with stuff like fresh coriander I worsen my candida for several days.  Still, I use extra virgin olive oil (also keeps the candida from converting), loads of red cabbige, fish (omega 3, kills fungus, not bacteria), advocados, and some others that I can’t remember right now, but mainly food that contains fatty acids against fungi and don’t work that well against bacteria. Now I eat a yoghurt called A38, containing aprox. 30 milion L. acidophilus pr. 100ml, I will try another one with aprox. 800 million units pr. 100ml. I can digest A38 a lot better then I could before, but I still get a little rash from eating it (as I always have from eating products containing lactose). My symptoms are those of the normal picture most people on here know, however there is one difference: I get rashes from all non-wholegrain breads, sugar, cow meat, pork, most fruits and milk/yugurt (believe less from the probiotic yugorts, but not sure). The thing is, I get the reaction (rash) right after I eat fruits, sugar and so on (not pork and cow), as soon as the stuff hits the bloodstream. Pork and cow is a bit slower, but also gives a lot of rash. The rash is treated with cortison (note: A steroid hormone) mostly, works great. Besides, I don’t get the rash on the diet – only when I take Brentan oral, due to its sugar content. I’ve tried treating the rash with clotrimazol and metronidazol, but it makes no difference, only hydrocortison helps. Now, I am not quite sure what to ask on all this, but help. I don’t know what to do next.. I feel I’m somehow stuck, and feeling that this condition is inherited from my mother and only worsen by taking antibiotics summer 2010. Sorry for any typos 🙂"
1,hope4eva77,227,"i feel ur pain and im here for u . i have this from antibiotics also ,living everyday in pain is soo hard and i understand your frustration .the stuff u take with sugar stop taking .im not sure what to say about the antifungals making u feel worse do u think mayb this is die off and it will pass ?"
2,klips32,227,"I did’nt have the die-off reactions for some time, only when it get worse over a rainy period of time and I then get better when it stops, in that progress I experience the same dieoff symptoms as I did when I started antifungal treatment. I will try to look into using Kefir and a stronger probiotic, containing more billions of bacteria then those I use now. I’ve stopped using Brentan, due to it’s sugar content, getting a nystatin containing antifungal drug for oral use instead. Would be here in a couple of days."
3,hope4eva77,227,"The probiotics have 2 be 30 billion or more & refrigerated , I am going to take udos choice 30 billion twice a day"
4,Danny33,227,"It may be important to note that Candida typically will build a resistance to many natural anti-fungals and prescription anti-fungals. This is why they seem to work a first then loose effectiveness. I believe the site recommends switching out anti-fungals every 2 weeks. If you use Oil of Oregano for example for 3 months everyday, chances are that its doing 0 good because the candida has built a resistance."
5,raster,227,"I would try out taking natural antifungals and higher grade probiotics. I would also try out taking HCL which is very important for those who have skin conditions: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst6027_Hydro-chloric-Acid-and-Health–written-by-Dr–McCoombs.aspx If you are eating things like rice, beef and pork, this can be very problematic. Your diet may not be strict enough. -raster"
6,klips32,227,"It’s quite difficult to gain enough focus to writhe in English at the time. From tomorrow and on I will take the following: 1. As you told me, a higher grade of probiotic: Udo’s choice (actually, before mentioned in this tread, I saw this in a local biostore). 30 billion, 1 early in the morning before anything eaten. And again 2 hours after the last meal in the evening, before bedtime. 2. A non-sugar containing oral suspension of nystatin, after each meal. I’m not eating pork, beef ore rice. But I believe that there is way to many carbohydrates in my diet, and then again there is to little variation in it. If I eat less carbs, I loose weight to fast (already lost 10kg, unfortunately most muscletissue) Here is what I eat in a day: In the morning: before breakfast: 2 multidophilus pills (6 billion bacteria) Plain yoghurt that has a larger amount of lactobacillus then normal, but only 2-3 tablespoons, it’s still diary. After that, I make the real breakfast: 2 pieces of non-yeast wholegrain bread, toasted and soaked in olive oil. Scrimps on top, onion, avocado, green salads with white and red cabbage. I make a big salad for the whole day to put onto my food, containing green stuff, cabbage and so on, nothing for the candida. 2. meal: could be 1 omelet (3 eggs) with salads an 2 pieces of same bread. A little garlic sometimes. 3. meal: yoghurt, occasionally with sunflower seeds ore pumpkin seeds 4. meal: salads, mostly fried fish with damped or fresh vegetables. Comes along with wholegrain pasta or same bread. 5. meal: yoghurt again. As I mentioned earlier: After each meal: 2 nystatin pills, and the oral suspension. before bedtime: 2 multidophilus again. Now this would be the kind of food I would eat in a low-energy day, other days I have the energy to make some different recipes. As you can clearly see, I have cut out most natural antifungals, this is due to the theory that I took a lot of them last year and only got worse (far worse then I am now). I can’t believe that a very high dosage of antibacterial food such as garlic without taking ANY probiotic, not even simple yoghurt does anything good for the gut flora. My experience is that the more probiotics and helpers for bacteria I eat, the more benefits I get from.. lets say peppermint tea which is antifungal and antibacterial too. Since I’ve almost systematic have destroyed my gut flora, the plan is to build up more bacteria from the lactobacillus stems and THEN introduce more natural anti-fungals. What do you guys think of this? Also: Damp and muggy areas: My apartment lacks of a proper ventilation system, however it’s very could outside at the time, so I open windows often to get in the dry air. I worsen VERY much in humid climate, anyone have good advice here? I even plan to throw out my only plant. /sorry if there is too much bad gramma."
7,alexalgebra,227,"If you want to go on a more strict diet, I would definitely cut out the bread/pasta, even if they are yeast-free. You don’t want to be having anything made of wheat, rice, quinoa, millet, etc. Same with the sunflower and pumpkin seeds – they can be irritating and have mold. I was trying to eat them still, but it was obvious that they were not digesting well and that they were a problem for me."
8,klips32,227,"I could cut out more of the carbs, but I have tried eating protein and fats only, that’s where I get too skinny and my overall health decreases very much. I got ill from almost anything and certainly not better regarding c. albicans. However, I’ll try it once again, counting how many calories I get in a day. Note: If the body only gets proteins and fats, it will turn them into ketones, this means no glucose -> No activity of the pancreas -> over time leads to diabetes type 1. Thanks for feedback 🙂"
9,Lady K,227,"Hi Klips,  I feel your pain, myself i have had a huge struggle with candida for a long time now since im young and still doesnt seem to go away but have managed to keep it at least dormant. I think every body reacts differently to this disease and that some things might work for some and other might make them worst thats why you have to listen to your body and if it doesn’t feel right discontinue. I can tell you that for me, i have severely restricted my carbohydrates and have seen much better results. I find that legumes will often set me off again like chickpeas and lentils so i try to be careful with those. I also stay away from cashews but I do eat alot of lower carb nuts (almonds especially) which are high in fats and oils which keep my weight steady. I stay as far away from canned foods as possible because they contain an ingredient called citric acid and candida feeds off of this as well. I take a combination of 2 different anti-fungals and continue them for 10 days MAX and then switch it up. I also take a 50 billion probiotic once a day before i go to sleep and drink LOTS of water (3 litres). But the thing i think that has helped me the most is the chinese medicine that i am using in combination its called Hsiao Yao Wan. Its a combination of herbs chinese herbs including liquorice root extract which you can find the list here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiao_Yao_Wan People like us might have an imbalance in our systems making our systems stagnant which also causes dampness in our bodies and making it a good place for candida to grow… the herb repairs the liver qi and invigorates the spleen functioning. Unfortunately you have to be patient with this herb because it can take up to a month to take effect but since i have been taking this herb i have had a lot less relapses and am a lot less sensitive to carbs and no more menstral cramps (YAY!!!). Also something really important is to listen to your body; if you get the urge to overeat something your tasting… just put it down (thats candida speaking) meditation and light exercises like yoga is essential to drying up the moisture in your body. I have been on the diet for almost 2 years now and seem to be getting better VERY slowly but it is a struggle Stay positive and find ways to enjoy yourself even though you have this ball and chain… its important for recovery I hope this helps K"

One serving of asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, green beans, and iceberg lettuce contains 2 g of sugar.  One serving of green cabbage contains 3 g of sugar.

A lot of symptoms have come and gone, with some still persisting, muscle & joint pain, brain fog, dizziness, muscle twitches, bad digestions (a lot of wind), I do have cracks in my tongue and some athlete’s foot too, oh and I’ve had problems with mild depression, sleep and panic/anxiety. I’ve been to the doctor so many times over the last two years, but they didn’t help at all, and eventually when I paid for some private tests for common viruses there wasn’t any useful results. Just over two weeks ago I met with a nutritionist and he has recommended a diet for dysbiosis as well as some energy supplements to help the adrenals etc. I did an adrenal stress index and they were working, but if anything on the high side – so producing more than normal range cortisol – it’s called adaptive response. (note the sample was on a relaxing day). Having spoken to the nutritionist and been reading this site I think it could be candida… I’m very thankful to the nutritionist and I’m quite excited about potentially finding a solution.. Anyway, I started the nutritionist recommended diet a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve already been through sugar withdrawal and seem to be in the process of a lot of what sound like ‘die off’ symptoms… I’ve made the mistake of not drinking much water some days, so I think I’m making the process quite difficult for myself.. Here is my current meal plan, I’d really appreciate any comments you have: 8am – Lamberts Probiotic (10 billion) – Porridge with milk – Viridian Phyto Nutrient Multivitamin – 250mg Magnesium Mid Morning Snack – Protein drink (Reflex natural whey – no additives) – Decaf / Green tea Lunch – Work canteen – meat or fish plus vegetables (definitely not organic or good quality) – Pau D’Arco team with Coconut oil  Mid Afternoon Snack – Handful of nuts (mixed) – Handful of coconut flakes  Dinner  – Meat or fish plus vegetables (usually green beans / broccoli/ spinach / sweetcorn (or sometimes Omelette)  Before bed  – Magnesium 500mg – Pau D’Arco tea I’ve pretty much been sticking to it, but my weakness is that I have been sometimes having a ‘breaded fish’ or a ‘meat pie’ rather than pure fish or meat and I have on average a small cup of white rice per day, are those game breakers? If anyone has time, my actual food diary is on my website here, click the link ‘food-diary’ to view, I really appreciate any comments. http://alexroan.com/food-diary/ I’m not perfect so far, but I used to eat chocolate every day and lot’s of carbs, so I think I’m making big steps 🙂 Hope everyone else here is making good progress and seeing benefits.

1,Able900,228,"Hello, Alex, welcome to the forum. If the foods shown on the food chart are what you are eating now, this isn’t going to work I’m afraid. You’re constantly feeding the Candida with foods such as carrot juice, rice, hash browns, and possibly the porridge (depending on what you use in the recipe).  Other foods that are definitely slowing your progress are ham, pork sausage, and beef. There are other items which are questionable because I have no idea what they contain. If you want to follow a protocol which has been proven to work, read the following posts.  The Forum’s Protocol  Testimonies  "

0,Kag,230,"I found this forum after searching online for anything that would help. I am pretty desperate. So, roughly a year ago, I developed a terrible rash on my lips that would go through a cycle. First my lips would burn and swell, following that they would rash and then it would subside for a day or two and start all over. I will say that during the four months that it was really bad, I also had angular chelitis that I finally got rid of using a topical antifungal for several weeks. I went to see a dermatologist but it took forever to see one because of having no insurance and by that time the rash was somewhat better and they were not impressed. 🙁 I had gone on a Candida Cleanse and the diet at the suggestion of a friend so it improved somewhat. I also used cortisone ointment when the swelling would start and it seemed to help. I tried not to overuse this however because I had heard bad things about cortisone and skin. A little history, I am a 44 year old female with a history of yeast infections from puberty on and lots of Utis, meaning lots of antibiotics. I just started another yeast cleanse and the diet again and will stay on it much longer. A naturopath told me that I need to be on a cleanse longer than a month to help this. The crazy thing is, I have no other obvious symptoms for yeast, or at least I think I don’t. I haven’t even had a female yeast infection in over a year. The dermatologist is doing a patch test for common skin care product allergens on Feb 1st. I feel, however, that this is food related. I think it might be an allergy if it is not yeast. She does not agree of course… Any and all help would be appreciated, especially if you have had a similar problem. I have been crying off and on today because I am so frustrated with always being in pain… Thank you so much in advance."

Yes, people do get completely better if they stay on a good protocol long enough. But once you’re better, if you go back to the average American diet, meaning a diet basically full of nothing but carbohydrates and sugar, then there’s a chance that you’ll cause the Candida albicans to reestablish themselves and send you right back in the middle of another infestation. The reason for this is that there is always Candida in the body, but normally it’s in the regular yeast form and not the fungal pathogen form; but the right environment can turn the fungal gene on which can then lead to a Candida albicans overgrowth. Read our protocol and the testimonies, and if you’d like to have the stricter diet that you’ll need for the protocol, just let me know. Testimonies  The Protocol"
3,Danny33,230,"Kag, Rash on face and sensitivity to smells are two of the many symptoms that I have. Symptoms can vary from person to person so the fact that your not currently getting yeast infections may not mean much. If you suspect it is food related, keep a food diary and look for triggers and always read ingredients. you can always get tested for food allergies. What I have found so far that is causing my rash is -> 1. Fruits/sugars 2. High-Flora pro-biotic (anything over 15 Billion CFU) 3. Pizza (I suspect wheat/dough/yeast is to blame for this since dairy doesn’t seem to bother me) I’m currently on a loose version of the candida diet now until I can afford some quality supplements. Garlic, lemon, and limes are currently what I’m taking besides the diet. This is a process and LISTON TO YOUR BODY."

U will beat this but it will probably take a longer time since u seem to have this a very long time. I wish u luck in your recovery! U can do this! We can do this LOL cuz I need all the help I can get myself. One thing is if u fall off the diet and binge, like I’ve been doing this past month, don’t give up keep trying!"
5,Kag,230,"Thank you so much for your responses. Able, I tried to find the protocol but I am not familiar with this forum yet so I couldn’t find it… I am on a pretty strict version of the candida diet but this is only the second time and obviously last time wasn’t long enough. I am going to a dermatologist but she insists on doing the product testing first. I really wish they would test me for food but since I don’t have insurance, I am kind of at the mercy of the university docs. I haven’t been a big bread or pasta eater for a long time but obviously, I shouldn’t have been eating any at all in addition to sugar. My biggest problem has always been with sweets, but I am pretty good at quitting things if they cause me pain. I really miss vinegar a lot though because I eat a lot of salads on this diet. Again, thanks so much for your responses. Any more responses or ideas would be greatly welcomed."
6,Kag,230,"Oh and Danny33, I thought probiotics helped with this.. Why would that cause your rashes?"
7,Able900,230,"Thank you so much for your responses. Able, I tried to find the protocol but I am not familiar with this forum yet so I couldn’t find it… Hello, Kag. I assume you saw the link for the protocol which I placed in my last post to you.I really miss vinegar a lot though because I eat a lot of salads on this diet.You can use Bragg’s apple cider vinegar in place of white distilled vinegar. As far as the probiotics causing Danny’s rash is concerned; a rash is one of the many symptoms of the die-off toxins. The probiotics can kill some of the Candida, therefore any number of die-off symptoms can appear including a rash. Able"
8,Danny33,230,"Oh and Danny33, I thought probiotics helped with this.. Why would that cause your rashes? Pro-biotics are needed for sure. Like Able said It’s probably die-off. So it means I will have to slowly work up the number of probiotics. For now I just eat fermented foods like greek yogurt, Kefir, and occasionally Kombucha. Also looking in to making my own sour kraut and kimchi. These foods all have lower levels of beneficial bacteria."

10,Kag,230,"I did read the symptoms that yeast can cause, I don’t seem to have many of them although I do have a few. I came on here because I work in a health food co-op and a couple of people said it might be yeast. One girl had a rash around her mouth and eyes that she cured with the diet and cleanse over a period of two months. I guess it was a little optimistic to think that mine would go away as fast. I don’t seem to have any food allergies that I have noticed. I kept a food diary for months and it doesn’t seem to be any one thing that trips the rash off. Once I started the diet and using some cortisone ointment for about a month (just two weeks with cortisone) I noticed an improvement but not complete resolution. I did get rid of the chelitis completely with the diet and the cream. Here is a weird one, if somebody can answer this. The only two things I have noticed that cause it to kick in for sure have been restaurant food, especially asian, or ocean water. I went to the ocean twice in the last year and both times I was in the water a lot, later that night I had the rash. Why would ocean water kick this in? I spent time in the sun, no problems, but the salt water… crazy… Also, is anyone on here besides Danny doing a looser version of the diet. I don’t want to lose too much weight. Not that I couldn’t stand to lose some but I think it is unhealthy to lose a bunch and then put in back on.  Plus I would really really really miss almond butter. The only die-off that I have seemed to experience is very itchy skin, but that is pretty much it. Although I have not been following the strict protocol as I read it today. Also, what are your thought on quinoa? We sell organic quinoa at my Co-op and I thought it would be okay later because of higher protein and lower carb intake. I also use it to bread things occasionally. Let me know! And thanks in advance!"
11,Kag,230,Any ideas from any of you on the reaction to restaurant food especially asian and ocean water? I am really curious to see if you have any ideas? Katie
12,Able900,230,"Kag;33233 wrote: Any ideas from any of you on the reaction to restaurant food especially asian and ocean water? I am really curious to see if you have any ideas? Hello, Katie. MSG (mono sodium glutamate) is used a lot in Asian cooking and can cause Candida symptoms to flare up. I would imagine basically all Asian restaurants use this. Another thing is that you have no idea as far as what ingredients restaurants are putting in their food, and if they use regular table salt instead of pure sea salt, you may be ingesting Dextrose along with the salt which can cause Candida reactions. I had to stop eating out for at least several months during the beginning of my own treatment, and most of the past members have done the same. I’ve never heard of sea water causing Candida symptoms before. I guess I’m wondering how you know for sure that it was sea water which caused the reactions. I imagine that you ate out at least once every day, how do you know for certain that it wasn’t delayed reactions caused by the restaurant food? Were you using a suntan lotion? If so, look at the ingredients since anything that is rubbed onto the skin can be absorbed into the bloodstream. Able"
13,raster,230,"You might be reacting to the sea water if your body is too alkaline or acidic…just a thought, test your pH. -raster"
14,Kag,230,"Hmmm… yes, a friend of mine had said something about asian using MSG… Sometimes it even happens when I eat at our Co-op hot bar, so I am going to have to ask them what they use. I never thought of the alkaline/acid thing, could be. Hey Able, I know it was the salt water because it was immediate, one minute my lips were fine, next stinging and rashy and I hadn’t applied anything other than lipstick. Only time that has ever happened has been with restaurant food and ocean water. Every other time it has been something that I woke up with. I think that is why I thought it was a food additive allergy for so long, not so sure that it still isn’t but I have to go through the product allergy test first…aaaargh… I had a little bit of a reaction yesterday to some hot bar food so now I am sticking to the cold bar which just has salads and stuff… This whole thing is such a downer… And I am starving!!! Sure that most of you can relate."

0,benc,232,"I feel like i’m almost symptom free. I rarely get the chronic fatigue & depression I was suffering with, my digestive system seems fine & hardly ever notice my dizziness (for which I’ve been tested & have a slight variation in my vestibular system from side to side). I’ve not picked up a cold since october (which considering almost everyone else I know has recently is a first) The only symptom that persists it the eczema on my hands, with which I am due to see a specialist next month. Foods I have re-introduced with success are: Almonds, Pumpkin & Sunflower seeds (always soaked overnight now). Swiss Water Decaf Organic Coffee.  Butter. Lentils (in chicken dhansak curry) Some non GMO vegan protein powders (although rarely, because they taste like crap) I’ve always eaten a low carb diet so really the only high carb things I will introduce on a regular basis is a sweet potato & squash (& that will be cooked in coconut oil), I will also try organic tomato sauce in the next few months. Using buckwheat, swede (which I love now) & coconut flour pretty much fulfils my carb or bulk food needs. I’ve dropped my anti fungal regime to just eating 3-4 x tablespoons of coconut oil (usually in food per day), swede or brussel sprouts (depending on what days i exercise) & supplementing with black walnut extract. I still take multi vit, vit c & d3, magnesium, glutamine, l-carnitine & strong probiotic daily (& will carry on doing so, as I was before I started). I’m going to give it until the 12 month stage to actually try something I consider a real threat like ice cream, chocolate, cheesecake, pizza or alcohol. Funnily enough the thing I fear the most is caffeinated coffee, its the thing I found hardest to do without & craved the most because of the band aid effect on my fatigue. I will never get back to drinking 3-5 strong cups of expresso per day, but would like to think one in the morning or before exercise wouldn’t be detrimental to my adrenal health. One of the hardest things to cope with is the negative mindset you get into when coping with this, I really would like to say to anyone who is reading this & struggling with that side of it to do their best to think of the future and that it does improve if you stick to some rules on diet & looking after yourself. I almost lost my business coping with this, but feel in a much better place now to build it back up. Thanks to all on here that helped me."

4,Flipper,232,"This was good to read. Congrats on being really consistent and seeing progress. I’m also 9 months in but have varied my diet (depending on which nutritionist has said what) and I’m not as far along as you. (OK, I’ve cheated a tad bit too – but hardly at all!) So I’m recommitting to the strict diet since I may have introduced some foods before I was ready. After all this time I keep coming back to Able’s diet as the right answer. I love to hear that people come out of this eventually. Thanks!"
5,benc,232,"I consumed more meat than was suggested on the diet (although avoided beef & still have not eaten pork since), and from 6 months in had the odd curry with lentils (using buckwheat instead of rice). I didn’t find the diet too much of a problem as I consider it to be healthy, and before I started I would eat a low carb diet only consuming high carbs around exercise (often maltodextrin for recovery – although now I will never knowingly consume it or any other PWO junk that is readily sold). I never had clear cut candida symptoms though, nothing like white tongue or anything like that. My symptoms manifested in chronic spells of dizziness and were always after spells of eating too much sugar or alcohol, &/or higher levels of stress. It took 3 bad attacks (that put me off work for anything from 2-6 weeks) in 2 years for me to realise it was related to the stomach. Perhaps leaky gut was the biggest problem for me. As a child I had 3 asthma attacks that left me in intensive care, as a consequence the doctors used to give me antibiotics for absolutely anything & always tried to push the flu jabs on me, and it only took till my late twenties to realise how damaging this was for my health. I used to take NSAID’s for hangovers & any pain as well."
0,alexalgebra,233,"Hey all! Today marks 4 weeks (28 days) on the diet for me! I actually started out on the Body Ecology Diet, then switched over to this one, but I thought I would post about my progress if anyone is curious. Here’s my general routine (it’s not perfect, but I don’t have a lot of $, so this is where I’m at right now): Morning: Upon waking, oil pulling with organic raw coconut oil for 20 minutes. (If I wake up in time, which I often don’t.) Drink one glass of plain water. Take probiotics immediately after, or immediately after waking if no time to oil pull. 1 Bifido Max, 2 lactis/acidopholous (sp), 2 tbsp of coconut water kefir with a glass of water with juice of half a lemon. Take chlorophyll drops (18) and kelp iodine (2) in 8 oz of water. At least an hour after probiotics, eat breakfast with a cup of detox tea. Take 3 Yeast Cleanse (awesome STRONG anti-fungal pills I found), 1 Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate, 3 spirulina, 1 Energy Multi, 1 HCl, 1 plant enzymes, 1-2 Gastrix, 2 Vitamin C. Afternoon:  Take HCl, enzymes, gastrix, Molyb, 1 vitamin C with lunch. Evening: With dinner (or evening snack), take HCl, enzymes, gastrix, molyb, 3 spirulina, 3 Yeast Cleanse, 1 vitamin C. 30 minutes after eating, take 8 oz water with chlorophyll and iodine. Just before going to sleep, at least an hour after anti-fungals and food, take 2 latics/acidopholus and 2 tbsp of coconut water kefir. I have a few pills that are combos – the multivite and the anti-fungal because it was cheaper to do that then buy a bunch of separate vitamins. They both seem to be pretty good ones though. I’m definitely pretty much broke from all the supplements right now; thank god I get paid in a few days. I’m going to be adding in Milk Thistle when I get my paycheck. I’m also going to add in some raw coconut oil, but I haven’t gotten the cojones to start eating it plain yet. I think I’m about there. It just kind of grosses me out, to be honest :p I eat a ton of it in my food though. My meals look something like this: Breakfast: Buckwheat hot cereal, stewed leafy greens Lunch: Bieler broth, coconut bread Snack: Bieler broth, coconut bread Dinner: Eggs with veggie stir fry Snack: More veggies, maybe more bread I’m really working hard at not overeating on the bread. It’s the only “easy” food though, and it’s so good!! My symptoms, pre-diet were: – Unable to tolerate literally any foods aside from eggs and small amounts of rice and very cooked veggies – Brain fog – Irritability – Irrational anxiety – ADD symptoms – Social anxiety – Fatigue/low energy levels – Easily overwhelmed – Occasional GI symptoms, but not too many Currently, if I don’t take the molybdenum regularly, I am getting some really intense die-off symptoms, these include: – swollen glands in my neck – headaches – sore throat – runny nose – irritability – panic attacks/emotional meltdowns – muscle aches However, I have seen some major improvements already. I have: – been able to eat many foods, including buckwheat and large quantities of vegetables, basically everything on the diet – had some days where I actually felt clear and happy, like I used to…I actually felt myself again!!! This is the best part. – experienced a major decrease in anxiety – I had some major constipation and bloating for the 2nd and 3rd week, but it has now almost entirely gone away – still had some weird poops, they are not very well formed, but they are there, so yay for pooping! I am feeling very hopeful and positive tonight, despite having a very bad afternoon (forgot my afternoon pills and didn’t eat enough). I cannot thank those of you on this forum enough for all of your wisdom, hope, and strength. I was struggling so much through this before I found this site, but seeing folks on here that have gotten through this to the other side that had it even worse than me makes me see that I, too, can beat this and feel like a normal person again!! I ordered kefir grains from eBay yesterday to make my own coconut water kefir (I’m using some medicinal store bought from Whole Foods right now called Inner Eco until I can get my own going), so once that’s here, I will be able to increase the amount I drink of that. Please let me know if you have any additional suggestions to my diet/regimen. Thanks! 🙂"

The better for, is what I do that makes my urethral burning/pain subside or makes me feel a bit better about my condition. The Worse for, is what causes my urethral burning/pain to flare up or symptoms get worse. I do believe its candida as i got it after antibiotics and now have a extremely high senstivity reading for mold when i had my blood tested for allergies. I also have the aching all over feeling, bloating, brain fog and a change in my memory and concentration that worried my friends and family, I’m 27 years old and forget what Im talking about or loose things really easily, forget a movie Ive watched and rent it out again and again lol! I forgot to mention I am taking a probiotic, I have one before bed and first thing in the morning. You are right about liver and kidney herbs/supplements I will look in to that. I also take chorella when i remember or can stomach it as 10 tablets in one go is a lot.

You stated:“I do believe its candida as i got it after antibiotics …”So we know that this is how you contracted a Candida overgrowth; so how did taking antibiotics destroy your health and bring about a Candida infestation in your body? It destroyed the flora in your intestines; therefore the flora will have to be completely reestablished before you cure anything including the overgrowth.

0,Chlofloso,235,"I decided to post my story here and keep it updated regularly instead of mixing it too much with questions I ask in the “General discussion” session. That way people who are interested can read it and share their thoughts. I’m so happy I found this forum and the diet of this forum, where everything has an explanation and makes sense. It is so much easier to follow a strict diet if you actually know what you are doing 😉 I’m thankful for every input I got from forum members so far and I hope that with time I’ll be able to help out as well! My story: I’ve had CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) for almost two years (but when I think back, I’ve been feeling tired very quickly since many years). The fatigue has been accompanied by intestinal problems such as pain and bloating, throat pain and swollen tonsils, brain fog, lack of concentration, and other small symptoms. The fatigue has been debilitating most of the time. Before I knew anything about Candida and this forum, a doctor who is a friend of a friend suggested that I might have Candida. He tested it with a kinesiology test (he put something into my hand and then I had to press my knee against his hand. Without anything in my hand, I managed to press really hard. With something in my hand about which he later told was Candida I could not press against his hand, there was no force in my knee. When he gave me another thing, which was an antifungal but I didn’t know that, my knee became strong again.) and then decided to put me on Diflucan for two weeks in addition to a Candida diet. I followed this diet for six weeks but in the meantime I know that it was not a good Candida diet since it was based on potatoes as main energy source. I had to take so called “alkaline pills” (which were composed of minerals) against die-off. I hardly experienced any die-off symptoms, but still felt much better after the two weeks on Diflucan. Intestinal pain and bloating had disappeared, mucus production and urinary bladder infections as well, my skin was suddenly looking perfect, my craving for food had gone, an invisible eczema on my leg did not itch anymore, and I felt less exhausted. When I stopped the Diflucan, the fatigue came back fully, even though all other symptoms still stayed cleared until today. During the last week on that diet I found this forum and immediately after week 6 started the forum diet. I thought I could never do it since I’m a vegetarian, since I did not like eggs, and since I hated the coconut oil – but I’ve gotten used to every part of this diet and have absolutely no problems with it anymore. I even ate chicken twice (I’ve not eaten a single bite of meat since I’ve been six years old) and liked as well as tolerated it! (It is not really okay due to my very ecological lifestyle and moral issues, but it certainly does help to open my mind 😉 ). I’m in week 4 of the strict forum diet now. I had to stop the antifungals for a week because I did not have the molybdenum yet and was experiencing strong die-off symptoms in the form of a rash, pain in the liver region and very bad insomnia. Yes, beginner’s mistake, should have taken the molybdenum more seriously… I’m taking the molybdenum now and will start the antifungals again day after tomorrow. Since I had stopped the antifungals, I did not introduce any new foods until day before yesterday. I was eating vegetables and eggs, nothing else. Now I’ve introduced coconut flour and want to add buckwheat after one week. I lost 7 kg and really think I should gain some weight! Besides molybdenum I’m taking milk thistle and gentian drops (will replace those with swedish bitters once the bottle is finished). Sometimes I imagine all of the forum members sitting around a huge table eating their omelets and veggies and swallowing all their pills… we are sort of a round table that spans the whole planet! Thanks to all of you and I will keep you updated. Chloë"

Symptoms that have vanished or gotten better during my Candida treatment (most of them vanished before I started the forum diet when I was still on another Candida diet, but I’m sure the forum diet contributes to them staying away): – a fungus on the skin of my feet – an invisible itching eczema on my lower leg – frequent urination and sometimes bladder infections – acne (completely gone!) – dry skin (not vanished, but better) – abdominal bloating and pain (sometimes still there, probably due to die-off. Got worse again when I started the forum diet due to eating so many vegetables and salads, and got completely better when I introduced buckwheat and ate less veggies) – itching scalp (not vanished, but better) – mucus production (first vanished completely, now came back and I don’t know whether it is due to coconut flour consumption or simply die-off) – thin white coating on my tongue – bad taste in mouth – nausea (still there sometimes) My main symptom, the fatigue, is persisting and has not gotten better. I still have very dry eyes. Other symptoms come and go and I assume they are die-off symptoms (headaches, flu-like feeling and so on). I’m not sure about the flu-like feeling since I used to have it even before I started the Candida treatment. After my initial very bad die-off where I didn’t sleep for several nights and had a bad rash on chest and neck, I’ve started antifungals very slowly. I’m taking 3-6 teaspoons of coconut oil per day and occasionally raw garlic, nothing else – I don’t want to feel worse than now because that would mean that I couldn’t function at all, and who would cook all my food then? 😉 I’ve started the kefir and a probiotic which is low in number and strains. I will raise the amount of kefir intake over some time and only then start taking a more effective probiotic. I’m a little concerned since the (slight) mucus production came back when I started the coconut flour, but I also don’t want to go back to the strict egg-vegetable stage because I lost so much weight then. Chloë"
3,Marbro,235,Wow lots of improvements and I’m glad you shared. I have skin ailments that have been bothering me since I started the diet and SD prior to the diet. I would give up the new found energy I now have for those to go away. Want to trade?:) Maybe try some buckwheat flower or oat bran flower and see if you have a reaction. The strict diet on the forums was to tough for me. I have been testing foods on the website that are not on the forum protocol. So far tomatoes I’m confident pose no problem. I feel for ya but your improvEments are something I hope to see soon. Keep us updated.
4,NadjaB,235,That sounds awesome Chlofloso! Congrats with the good result so far 🙂
5,Chlofloso,235,"Haha yes, let’s open a market place for symptoms – I can offer some fatigue, would give it away for a small fungus on the skin, Marbro? lol I’ve already tried buckwheat flour and have no problems with it. However now in my whole city (which is the biggest city of Switzerland where you can usually buy everything) buckwheat products are sold out and they seem to have problems even with the raw buckwheat supply ;( bad news for me… seems like I’m forced to introduce something else. I’m having really bad die-off (I suppose) – nausea, abdominal pain, back ache, and the only thing I ate today besides eggs and vegetables is sour cabbage! No antifungals…"
6,Chlofloso,235,"Hello to all! I was on a vacation for ten days and am back now. I visited friends in two cities where I’ve studied and couchsurfed in another city. Everything went really well with the food, all the people I stayed with were very interested in the diet and adapted to it and even ate the same food I ate. Really nice. I was doing a lot of things though, much more than I normally do, and therefore didn’t spend as much time in the kitchen as I usually do. I think I ate less vegetables and more buckwheat than normally. For breakfasts I had yoghurt with millet flakes. I never cheated but I’m afraid I fed the Candida all the same a little since I’d reduced antifungals to just a little bit of coconut oil and since some of my acne has come back. I guess I overdid it a bit with the yoghurt, millet flakes, and buckwheat. I didn’t take more antifungals because I didn’t want to have die-off during travelling (and I never had, I actually felt quite good all the time and slept really well). Yesterday after I came back I had two raw garlic cloves and got really bad die-off with nausea, abdominal pain, really bad back ache, and a headache. I completely stopped eating coconut flour since it greatly enhances my mucus production. My current diet looks like this: Breakfast: Yoghurt with millet flakes or buckwheat flakes, or yoghurt and buckwheat bread with coconut oil smeared on top Lunch: Salad with boiled eggs or omelet with fried veggies, crushed garlic if I can handle the die-off, little bit of buckwheat in some form if I am very hungry Dinner: Vegetables with either buckwheat, millet, or fish (fish about once a week) Antifungals: Coconut oil (trying to increase dose), sometimes raw garlic. Planning to add in oregano oil, but will wait some more days because of die-off. Inputs are welcome. Happy easter everyone!"
7,princeofsin,235,Any more updates?
8,Chlofloso,235,"Hi Prince and others, This is week 10 of the diet. Since a few days I suddenly have a lot of hair loss, something I never had before. As you can read in the thread “Sudden hair loss” in the general discussion, this is either a late-onset Candida symptom, or a sign of copper deficiency, probably connected with the intake of molybdenum. Copper deficiency leads to symptoms of iron deficiency. I have hair loss, very tight calf muscles and menstrual problems as three new symptoms which could be symptoms of iron deficiency. I will therefore decrease the dose of molybdenum (carefully, since I want to avoid die-off which might harm my liver and body) and buy a copper supplement as well as drink more nettle leaf tea. My general symptoms have not changed since the last update. The symptoms I still have (don’t know which of them are Candida-related and which not) are: * fatigue * dry eyes and skin * general feeling of being ill and feverish, without having a fever * feeling of feverish eyes, and they look feverish too * itching scalp Even though not that much changed, at least symptoms didn’t come back and I am patient and hopeful that I am on the right track. I stopped eating millet since I don’t really need it if I have buckwheat and want to wait a little more before I add grains. I also limited my buckwheat consumption and am eating a lot of eggs, Greek yogurt / quark, vegetables and salads. I introduced tiger nut flakes and am eating them once in a while, but only a very small amount. They help a lot with digestion. I’m eating chicken or fish about once a week."
9,kitty,235,"I really like your diary and updates. Thanks for sharing them. I am also a (ovo-lacto) vegetarian since childhood, but have been wanting to eat fish for a long time. I hope to be able to soon. “- an invisible itching eczema on my lower leg” i had this on my shins for over a year. i don’t know what made it go away, but it occasioanlly comes back still. I now have a visible rash on my hands that gets extrememely itchy if I wash my hands. My doctor told me to take fluconozole which I already had at home, but he didn’t tell me how much. So, I’m taking 150mg for up to 7 days or until it goes away. How much did you take during your two weeks? “- itching scalp (not vanished, but better)” maybe try adding a drop of teatree, lavendar or rosemary oil to your shampoo or conditioner if it’s your whole head rubbing a small amount into the itchy spots. You can also make a “tea” with rosemary or sage and let it cool before using it as a rinse after you’ve rinsed with just water. “-nausea (still there sometimes)” ginger might help with nausea?"
10,Chlofloso,235,"Hi Kitty, thanks for sharing your thoughts. I took 50mcg/day of Diflucan for two weeks. However, I do not recommend it since natural antifungals are just as strong and are not harming your liver. I honestly don’t think that Diflucan is more effective, plus, it’s more expensive and in rare cases can lead to severe liver damage. Thanks also for your inputs on how to get rid of the itching. The itching is not that bad, so I can live with it and I actually want to see it go away just by following the diet, because that will give me an indication that my treatment is progressing. Therefore I won’t treat it externally as long as I can handle it. All the best to you! Chloe"

12,Chlofloso,235,"Forgot to say that the mentioned dose of Diflucan gave me much less die-off than the forum regimen with the natural antifungals, which proofs that the latter is more effective."
13,kitty,235,"Hi Chloë, Thanks for sharing. I’ve now been on Fluconazole 150 for my rash for four days. I initially thought it was helping since it had significantly improved by yesterday, but last night it came back and is spreading up my arm. I put off starting the detox because of the Fluconazole and now I’m unsure if I’ll do more harm if I suddenly stop taking it after seemingly making the yeast stronger. I agree that the diet and natural anti-fungals are more effective and safer in the long run, but I’m not sure what to do in the short term since I would like to rip my skin off. I’ll keep you posted on another thread since I don’t want to hijack yours. Thanks again for keeping your log."
14,Chlofloso,235,"Hello to all. This is an update before I leave for the summer. I have stopped eating quark/Greek yoghurt and started eating only kefir, because I was unsure whether the quark might slow my treatment down. I started using Nizoral shampoo to see whether it helps against my hair loss, and also started a mineral supplement. The hair loss is slightly better, but still there. My copper test was normal (just got the results), therefore I don’t blame the molybdenum for the hair loss and I think the hair loss must be a Candida (or die-off) symptom. I will therefore increase the intake of molybdenum again. The test results (from an alternative medicine clinic where I’ve recently been) also showed that my body is not optimally capable of detoxing via the enzyme epoxidhydrolase since I’m heterozygous for this enzyme. They advise me to take more antioxidants. I’m excreting a bit too much copper, nickel, thallium, and tin, suggesting that I have some metal charge. For this, the doctor advises to take acetylcystein (in the form of a drug available here called “Solmucol”), which is supposed to help with detoxing the metals. My IgG reaction is a little high for tomato, peppers, garlic, and mustard. They advise me to avoid these food items for three months. I don’t eat tomato and peppers anyway, but I’m gonna miss garlic as an antifungal and a great taste improver. I have not added anything to my diet and have removed quark, excess herbal tea, and (several weeks ago) tiger nuts in order to be safe. I’m eating oat bran, buckwheat, eggs, vegetables, kefir, olive oil, ghee, apple cider vinegar, coconut flakes, and that’s it more or less. As for supplements, I’m now taking vitamin C, vitamin D, glutathione, omega-3 fatty acids, silymarin, molybdenum, minerals, ashwaganda, acacia fiber and a probiotic (Dr. Mercola 70 billion CFU with DDS-1). I’m planning to take a medium dose of antifungals, not as high as I used to, and a medium-dose of molybdenum as well. In terms of symptoms, I have no idea which are symptoms and which are continuous die-off symptoms. Basically not much has changed regarding symptoms since my last update. My fatigue and cramped muscles also have not changed. The fact that I’m still experiencing some die-off proves that I still have a lot of Candida. Always thankful for comments, and enjoy the summer everyone! Chloë"
0,Sydney Keith,236,"Well I have tried a few diets and they just have not worked for me. It is difficult to stay on the diet and at times I felt like I was digressing. After numerous reviews on products and doing my own research, I have finally came up with a plan that has shown success! I try to have a diet consisting of low carbs, low sugar, and high protein. One thing I’ve been missing (commonly neglected) is a good source of essential fats. To fill this need I have been using UDO’s oil. I have also added pinecone extract to my plan in order to balance my immune system; another important piece of the puzzle that is commonly neglected. My plan has been working for me and I thought it would be a good idea to share it with all of you. I am always looking to improve my plan so suggestions are encouraged! Sydney"
1,hope4eva77,236,"What were U eating?  What are your symptoms?  How long have u had yeast issues?  Thank u, I’m just curious also and u say u been better good job!  U doing something right!"
2,Sydney Keith,236,"I have had issues for over 4 years, I beat it but it has always returned. From the top of my head, the symptoms I have had include chronic fatigue, migraines, depression, aches and pains, countless sinus infections, diarrhea, and I had to refrain from having sex because of the pain. The food I eat has to be altered weekly or else I get bored! I eat a lot of free range chicken, fish, duck, eggs, and different types of nuts (almonds, pecans, cashews). Vegetables I eat include broccoli, cucumbers, green peppers, brussel sprouts, tomatoes, beans, celery, lettuce, and spinach. I also enjoy wild rice, brown rice, quinoa, and plain yogurt. I drink lots of water and almond milk. Do you disagree with any of these items, or recommend others? Like I said, I need to switch it up quite a bit so I am looking for suggestions. I received the pinecone extract tip from Terry who is blogging about her fight with candida. You can see her blog here: http://www.myjourneywithcandida.com/ Sydney"
0,Positivo,237,"Hey guys, I decided to write this up because I do not know what’s really happening, I’m 6 weeks into the protocol. For a week or so I have been having back aches that won’t go away. Oddly it doesn’t bother me when I play basketball and when I workout at the gym, lifting weights or cardio and I have been going from constipation to diaharria with everything I eat and bad gas. I m trying to figure out if this is die off? Anyone have this experience? As far as the diet I’m eating cream of buckwheat with stevia coconut oil cinnamon, eggs chicken 2-3 days a week,1-2 days a week salmon, 2 days a week sardines, just stopped taking oat bran (suspicious it could be a problem for me), cooked veggies such as broccoli, cauliflower, Brussel sprouts, green beans, kale spinach, mustard greens, turnip, eggplant, avocado and evoo. I juice celery cucumber lemon and ginger. Supplements are listed below but I don’t have exact doses. Swedish bitter  Coconut oil 4-6 tbl. Molybdenum after breakfast 3 tablets Sf 722 15 gels Probiotics morning 4 caps (140 billion 10 strains) Grapefruit seed extract 30drops Oil of oregano 2 gel caps Black walnut 4 caps Garlic and parsley 4 caps Pau d arco 4 caps Vitamin C 1000mcg and D 500mcg Bentonite clay Dgl licorice Today I woke up with crazy diaharria. I had like 7 bowel movements. I’m confused I hope this is a good thing like detoxing. Not sure at first I thought it was eggs and I cut it out for a 10 days and still had diarrhea. I ate eggs today felt fine so I’m ok with eggs. I’m cutting oatbran now to see if that’s it but I’m hoping this is die off.I have had die off before but in form of rash, red eyes, bumps on sick, fatigue and brain fog. I’m trying to stay positive, I do breathing exercises. When I run at the gym or before I go out I breath in with a deep breathe and say “positive energy in” and as I breathe out I say “negative energy out” or “candida out” lol. Im trying to become more spiritual and positive. Having candida has been a huge wake up call and life lesson for me, I’m 21 and life has been a breeze up until this point. I would say I have been spoiled With everything. I’m grateful for the experience it has taught me to be patient, grateful for life, to take advantage of life’s blessings, appreciate the little things even more and much more but I’m ready to move on with my life and to be honest I ve grown to enjoy the diet. I see myself eating this way foever with the addition of other healthy foods, mainly fruits and oatmeal witha few random cheats but as for now I’m ok with my,current diet. Thanks for reading everyone and any replies would be awesome and greatly appreciated."
1,Chlofloso,237,"Hi Positivo, just wanted to let you know that I’m also experiencing very strong back ache every time I have die-off. At the beginning I thought it was coincidence, but meanwhile I’m convinced that it’s part of the die-off. It usually starts very suddenly, together with nausea and stomach pain, and lasts for many hours. The symptoms also disappear at the same time. Good luck with everything! Chloë"

Chloë Chloe, I’m happy to hear that someone else has this backache as well. I was hoping that it wasn’t anything to serious because serious back injuries never really go away. I was afraid of this because I lift weights but at this point it’s just light stuff anyways. Today I lifted, mainly squats and deadllifts (25lbs max). These exercises rely heavily on your back and I felt fine. I need to figure something out about my gas and diarrhea. I cut out buckwheat today and I just stick to allowed veggies lightly cooked with salmon, chicken, eggs and sardines. That’s about it and stick to the supplements. I’ll do this for the rest of the treatment. The carbs could be the verdict here. Not sure but I’ll see how I feel in about a week. I hope you improve as well and good luck."
3,Positivo,237,Well a quick update. Today my backache and diarrhea have gone away. I think it was a part of die off. My gas has also improved. I think it could of been the amount of food I was eating in one sit in. Not sure because I cut buckwheat and oatbran and I have smaller portions while waiting a little bit before I drink water and take supplements after meals.

6,Positivo,237,"I noticed that this topic has quite a few views so Ill keep updating it with my progress if people care to read. Today makes 7 weeks and I havent had any candida symptom related to my digestive system (bloating,bad gas, diarrehia) and these were the ones that concerned me the most. Im starting to reach the point where Im completely symptom free, but not there just yet. I am still experiencing die off as I have a rash on my neck again for about the 3 rd time and I have an infection on my fingertip which im controlling with oil of oregano drops and constantly cleaning it so that it doesnt get worse. Feeling great. Hope I can continue to make more progress. Good luck to all."
7,Positivo,237,Update The rash on my neck is gone and the infection on my finger is gone as well. The oil of oregano worked nicely on it. Just one drop a few times a day and constantly washing it. This is week 8 and the gas as returned though not as bad as before. I’m going to cut chicken out completely because I feel like I don’t need it anymore. I’ll just eat eggs and sardines. Feeling great. Good luck to everyone.

9,Positivo,237,"I really am. Lucky the most of my troubles revolved around digestion. It’s doing great today, just trying to get some kind of consistency. I hope everyone can get some relief. I’m not cured but I’m a step closer and this is a completely 180 degree turn from last year. I hated last year and I’m looking forward to enjoying this year and the many more to come. Good luck to you and everyone. Also zypan works great for gas. Raster put me on that but you must take it with every meal or else you may not find a consistency with the relief."
10,Positivo,237,Update 2 months in and I realized that I was feeding the candida with sorbitol which is an ingredient in dgl licorice that I was taking occasionally for a couple months and I realized its in tooth Paste too but I switched to Toms toothpaste anyways. What’s interesting is that my digestive problems are looking much better today and I’ve been stuffing my face with allowed foods. Don’t know if it’s in my head or that ingredient made the world of difference for me. I also researched sorbitol and it causes bloating gas and diarrhea. Unfortunately licorice is good for the gut but not if it includes harmful ingredients. Thanks for reading

12,Positivo,237,"Update So I removed eggs from my diet and diarrhea has not been a problem for me all week which is a relief. I hope I can get over this allergic reaction I have to eggs. So after 2 months or so my only symptoms are the white coating on my tongue and gas, occasional bloating. Nothing serious. Gas is a pain though, even digestive enzymes won’t help. I’m taking digestive bitters and zypan with meals. I might need to take zypan alone as well as with meals. I hope this goes away within the next month. I’m extremely happy that my bowel movements have improved so much lately. I’m keeping a close eye on my diet to see what I can do about the gas. I wake up with it and I think it’s from die off because I take coconut oil around the night as well as 2 cloves of garlic and Raw apple cider vinegar. When I take these I get gases and my stomach makes some interesting sounds and then I wake up with the gas. All in all I’m very happy considering the fact that I was consuming sorbitol in my dgl licorice supplement and I been eatings eggs while having a reaction to it. I see things getting better in the next coming weeks. I’ll keep everyone posted. Thanks for reading."
13,Positivo,237,Also I have only been able to take 10-12 spoons a day of coconut oil. The stuff gets me nauseous. If this matters to anyone
14,Positivo,237,I just wanted to make a quick note. I’ve been complaining about gas since. Day 1 and today I feel amazing. Changes I’ve made today are I finally introduced some commercial kefir which not only didnot give me a reaction but it improved the gas I woke up with. The other difference is that I took Swedish bitters before my meal instead of immediately after. What a difference I feel. Gas has been haunting me for the past year so I hope I can see long term relief with these changes.

0,homeistexas,239,"November 1-10 antibiotics. November 13th thought I was coming down with the flu. This was the leaky gut. I had had anal itch off an on for years. Year round allergies, occasional depression. Little did I know what the root cause was. So after much research and three trips to the Dr, I finally googled internal fungal infection. I did this because antibiotics would have taken care of a bacterial infection and my blood work showed no signs of a virus. I did get diflucan for a month for the anal itch. That was horrible. If anything I think it prevented me from healing because I didn’t get better untill I was done taking it. I am posting this on here and then I am done unless anyone has any questions. Four parts to my success. 1. The diet. It was tough at first but I got used to it. I lost 20 lbs too. It was all good till the leg cramps hit. Possibly an iron deficiency. So I went from one multivitamin a day to 8 and they were gone in 48 hours. Eggs were my best friend. 2. The sauna, 30 minutes a day for a month. Drink plenty of water. 3. Supplements: Milk Thistle and molybdenum for the die-off although the milk thistle was way more important because most multi-vitamins already have molybdenum. A few to create a hostile environment for the candida: a. Garlic b. Flaxseed oil soft gels c. vitamin c A few to protect me through this. a. Niacin b. Potassium c. B1 d. Apple lectin as a fiber substitute 4. Most importantly, the pro-biotics: 1. Acidipholis. Started with two a day. Didn’t do anything till a month in when I figured out that I didn’t need to suppliment good bacteria but rather had to introduce enough good bacteria to overpower the fungus. So, 12 a day! 2. CandiZyme. Next to the milk thistle, this made the most noticeable difference. Three every night before bed. Lastly, excercise. Get outside and run if you can. This will boost your immune system. Good luck!"
1,Able900,239,"If success is truly the case, congratulations are in order. However, your story is somewhat confusing; for example, you wrote that on November 13 you had leaky gut syndrome bad enough to make you believe that you were coming down with the flu, correct? So are you saying that less than two months ago you had both a Candida overgrowth and leaky gut syndrome and you had just completed a ten-day round of antibiotics, yet today you are completly cured? (as one would conclude from your subject title) To quote you, “CandiZyme. Next to the milk thistle, this made the most noticeable difference.” My question is; the most noticeable difference in what exactly?"
2,homeistexas,239,I think I already had an outbreak coming and the antibiotics made it go into overdrive. The candizyme made the extreme fatigue and brain fog start to dissolve.
3,hannah,239,"I noticed you took niacin. I had been taking niacin for “high cholesterol,” but stopped taking it when I started on the Candida diet/supplements thinking the diet/supplements were making my liver work hard to get rid of the Candida. How much niacin do you take and what time of day do you take it (am/pm)? Also, if you don’t mind, why do you take niacin? Glad to hear things are going well!"
4,homeistexas,239,Niacin does not reduce cholesterol.I took it as an anti-oxident and for DNA repair as well as to protect my brain. I took it for DNA repair because the candida can lead to muscular distrophy and even cancer. Cancer happens when cell DNA mutates. I wanted to prevent that. These days cancer can set in in a number of weeks.
5,hannah,239,Thanks for responding. How many mg niacin do you take and at what time of day?
6,homeistexas,239,"Sorry, you asked before and I forgot to answer. I take 500mg every morning."
7,hannah,239,Thanks again…..I’m going to add the niacin back in!
8,raster,239,How long have you had leaky gut and what symptoms of leaky gut do you have? Have you tested leaky gut to see if you still are allergic to the foods you once ate? -raster
9,homeistexas,239,I said leaky gut because the initial symptom could only be attributed to the toxins entering my blood stream. Severe fatigue and brain fog lasted almost two months. No I did not get a test. You know one of the worst parts of a candida outbreak is getting doctors to take you serious.
10,raster,239,"I believe you are using the term leaky gut incorrectly. Leaky gut is when holes are created in the gut (by candida) and you become allergic to nearly everything you eat. You get what I call the “leaky gut burn” when food particles enter the bloodstream through the holes that are in your mucousal membranes and your body creates an immune response. Other “reaction” symptoms include headaches, nausea, hyperventilation, ringing ears, irritability, etc. Basically it feels like indian rug burn but throughout your whole body. People who get leaky gut have typically been constipated for a very long time and have had candida for years. In order to heal leaky gut, you need to be on this special diet for a long time, and you need to take specific supplements that heal the gut. I was able to heal mine within a year or so and I had it very bad. To test whether you still have leaky gut or not, you simply eat foods not allowed on the diet such as grains, sugar, etc. and see if you get the allergic response I mentioned above. You can also get specific allergy tests for a proper diagnosis…you will be allergic to nearly everything (I never did this). -raster"

When you have leaky gut, tiny food particles and proteins enter the bloodstream from small ruptures made by the Candida in the intestinal walls.

Its day 2 of strict diet 4 me and I’m overwhelmed with bladder pain, vulva pain that feels like yeast infection but I’d not showing up on culture I actually ate sweet potato and a small pack of m&Ms snack size and am still feeling worse! I know I have to b strong & not cheat. I feel I am making progress from the horrible diet I had. I am upset because even with cheating I still have bad die off! I have yo work and clean, cook, and my daughter is 18 months into everything! .I will list. My supplments soon. I’m just really frustrated right now."
1,Able900,240,Things you can do and supplements you can take to lessen the die-off response. Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate (Take 250 mcg tablets up to 3 or 4 times a day) Milk Thistle NAC (N-Acetyl-Cystein) Candidate made by Native Remedies (this is great for instant relief of the headaches and fogginess) Drink tons of water to wash the toxins out. Take saunas and/or soak in a hot tub of water for 20 minutes.
2,homeistexas,240,"Day two of the diet is still miserable time. Milk thistle was absolutely amazing for me! I am going to post my whole one month success story. M&M’s were a very bad idea. Some things that got me through the diet; pecans, walnuts, sunflower seeds, eggs, turkey bacon, plain yogurt, plain tuna, sweet potatoes. More eggs than anything. The sauna if you have access to one. Hang in there it does get better."

0,mphenry1,241,I think it is a safe food for phase 1 let me know if not It was a awesome last night I had some of my first real food again after the cleanse/detox. I made a small bowl of Bobs Red Mill oat bran hot cereal and put cinammon on it. Wow finally a feeling of satisfied after eating. Had it with a touch of stevia and cinnamon even better. Super easy to make as well just followed directions on bag.
1,hope4eva77,241,i think so i am just starting out on day 2 of stage 1 and have been eating it with stevia .

0,Choloe,242,"I thought it might be cool to say a bit about how awesome friends and family can be when you get a bit sick. Reading peoples stories on here about how tough candida has been for them (sometimes its like going through hell) I’d figure to get through hell you need mates and family at your side. So I thought it might be cool for people to just tell their stories about friends having your back and family telling you its ganna be ok… X) Anyway I’m not exactly that sick and I am trying to avoid my issues from becoming systemic and my mates have been amazing with telling me great foods I can eat on this diet, and giving me recipes. I have a lot of friends on restrictive diets and they have been a great help. Because drinking is out my friends have made sure to stop drinking when they are out with me which they really do not need to do but I guess I am lucky to have such wiked mates. <3 Anyone else got a good gang around them??"
1,hope4eva77,242,i wish i could my family is not supportive im hoping once i get better and they see i get better they will know why i work so hard to eliminate yeast
2,Nekotamo,242,"For me family, loved ones, relatives and friends are the point of life. So with or without candida I think your post is beautiful and all people should read it whether having candida or not. I am sure we all are going to get better if we focus, put a lot of effort in this all – diagnose ourselves properly, do proper treatments and follow the diet STRICTLY. Family and friends can just help us in this process… But hey, so as this forum! 🙂 we’re all some type of friends as well, since we fight together against this annoying yeast! For me you’re all comrades! 🙂 @hope4eva77 Don’t worry! I didn’t even tell my family about my problems, only some friends know about my potential candida, and my brain fog problems. What is important that they are there for you and that they love you. Sometimes people are skeptic about these types of disorders and believe that we’re being paranoids and such, but I’m sure they don’t do it out of bad intention, its just one of those things – full belly doesn’t believe to the starving one. Just hang in there, this is luckily a treatable condition 😉"
3,titan,242,"This is a very important subject due to the nature of this condition and it’s non-existence in western medicine. It is understandable that people are skeptical and put trust in western medicine. You don’t have any proof to show people, until you start to get better. I think of lot of sufferers try to get others to believe in the condition before they start a treatment…probably because you have doubt yourself. This can be a very slippery slope if the people you are trying to convince are skeptical. Think about it, if one of your friends was suffering from anxiety, depression, and panic attacks, and came up to you saying they think they have something that doctors don’t believe, and they self-diagnosed themselves on the internet…you would probably be skeptical, even might think they are paranoid or a hypochondriac. From my experience, my family became supportive when they heard of another local woman that suffered from Candida and cured herself with a year long diet. But it was lucky that a cousin heard me talking about Candida at a 4th of July party and then told me and my parents the story of her co-worker who cured herself. From that day on, my parents are completely on board. But that was very lucky. They were very skeptical before that. And others have become supportive when they see how serious you are once you start your treatment, especially when you can tell them you are honestly getting better. Luckily, I now have the full support of my nuclear and extended family and all of my friends 100%. Some people took longer than others to come around, but eventually people realize you are getting better, and that’s all that matters. I used to hold big parties with beer tastings and bbq cookouts…Now, when I bring a cooler bag to the office, a family event, or to watch Notre Dame vs Alabama next Monday night at a house party, people are more understanding. They see this different guy who is much calmer and sincere about trying to regain his health."
4,hope4eva77,242,"thanks my mom is very supportive ,its my hubby that isnt ,i tell my friends that i have to change my diet cuz of a health condition but not the whole story ."
0,1533jd,243,"Hi everyone. I have had Candida for over 2 years now, of which the majority of this duration I spent suffering without any ideas of what was wrong with me, only to find out 2 months ago after countless visits to doctors various hospitals that I was suffering from Candida, Leaky Gut Syndrome and IBS. What a relief I must say to find that I wasn’t going insane and that I hadn’t developed some sort of chronic mental health problem, just a very debilitating condition as a result of developing all these conditions. Im curious to know who here on this forum also experiences brain fog as a symptom of Candida and what their experiences of it has been? My experience  I remember from about the age of 15 experiencing very poor memory recall and comprehension problems, such as the inability to be able to answer a question properly or read a bit of text and be able to full comprehend in my mind what I had just read. These traits naturally caused me to have serious trouble learning at school and achieving what I believed I was able to achieve despite being a fairly intelligent student. From this I thought I had dyslexia – I had a series of tests which came back negative, which led to a few raised eyebrows. I remember trying my utmost to listen and learn in classes but to no avail my great efforts did not develop into good work or results, which naturally I found extremely frustrating and gave my confidence a big knock on the work front. When I left school I found that I was starting to encounter a series of problems which didn’t add up. I started to develop huge amounts of anxiety when being in social situations with my CLOSE friends whenever I would see them, which obviously started to worry me. My memory recall had become SO severe that my ability to generally think and remember what I had been up to completely diminished and whenever I would try to recall something to a friend of what I had been up to I just sat there in silence going um..er.. etc. Whenever I was thinking my mind felt like it was like walking through marshland, which naturally made me think I had developed social anxiety or a mental health problem out of nowhere. Not being able to use your mind is hugely distressing as Im sure you all know! So, brain fog started by affecting my work and now had decided to divulge into my social life and then as time went on, every aspect of my life, which led me onto becoming very introspective and therefore depressed as a result. I have always been a popular easy going person, and never took myself too seriously. I would like to see myself as a warm, caring and funny guy who before all this was seen as an extremely confident person who basically loved living life. What I have learnt is that brain fog doesn’t just affect your intelligence but also your emotional intelligence, such as being able to control your emotions, have perspective and to be able to reason well in situations, which made it very difficult managing my emotions and so therefore led to behavioural problems. The wealth of knowledge I had gathered over time wasn’t able to be applied in moments of doubt and stress which prevented me from being able to reassure myself that everything was going to be ok in certain situations. Hope you enjoyed the read and can share your stories. Best Wishes, Jamie I still have this brain fog but I’m positive that It will get better soon. After all I have learned patience is a virtue. "
1,mork,243,i have literally just read everyone of my symptoms. apart from chronic fatigue have you started the diet? if so how are you doing? mine started around 17 and sounds exactly like what you have experienced i plan to beat this fucker after christmas! hope all is well
2,Able900,243,"Brain fog is probably the most prevalent symptom of both a Candida infestation and the die-off effect from the two Candida toxins, aldehyde and ammonia. The brain fog usually remains a constant problem until one learns how to control it by using a product called Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate which helps to remove the toxins. Three times a day take a 250 mcg tablet to control the brain fog. You can also use a supplement called Candidate by Native Remedies. The toxins are particularly dangerous to the liver, so the herb, milk thistle, will help to protect the liver from the toxins. Also you should drink lots and lots of water and take saunas to help remove the toxins from the body. Able"
3,slowsmile,243,"There can be several reasons for symptoms like brain fog, lethargy etc when you have candida problems. The primary cause for the above problems are the alcoholic and aldehyde toxins released by the candida fungus in your body as waste into the blood. This adversely affects the brain and also affects energy and sleep. You can take larger dose Molybdenum or Sodium Molybdate to cure these debilitating symptoms. Molybdenum is also a candida killer that has been used for years to prevent yeast and fungal infestations during storage of grains in agriculture. Molybdenum is also the central metallic atom that is needed to form an essential human enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase in the body whose main function is to remove all aldehyde, alcohol and other toxic hydrocarbons from the body. See this piece of research on candida and aldehyde toxins: The Candida/Aldehyde Detox Pathway Therefore taking 10 mgs to 25 mgs Molybdenum for two weeks only should be enough to increase the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme in your body which will both help to kill off the candida and prevent the debilitating symptoms. The only problem with this, as I have found, is that it is very difficult to buy Molybdenum or Sodium Molybdate in amounts greater than 900 mcgs(the maximum allowed RDA dosage). Another reason for your brain fog etc, could also be due to low thyroid caused by lack of iodine in the diet. This was the case when I had candida. When I had systemic candida I cured this problem by taking larger dose Lugol’s Iodine on a daily basis(Iodine is also a rapid candida killer). The thyroid gland is the governor of all the hormones, whose action essentially controls the metabolic rate of all processes in the body. And so if you have both candida and a lack of iodine in the diet — you metabolic processes will be inefficient and this can also help to cause brain fog, lethargy, insomnia, lack of energy etc. For more info and insight with reasons and research, on how to cure candida with a full protocol — see this link"
4,whyitsme,243,"Yes I too had the brain fog issues, it wasn’t until I had done the die off and had the candida out of my system that I realized how foggy I had been for years. With a clear system I could concentrate better, have desire to learn, and am much calmer emotionally and in how I make decisions. If I have been bad then clear it out again, I get a killer headache when it dies off clearing out of my brain. Which in itself is kind of creepy knowing that it infests the brain. Also right before it starts to die off I notice I tend to get a bit emotional and paranoid, then the headache comes the next day. Therefore I know what is causing it and basically just know to stay away from people and hang out in front of tv for the night, for it will pass. Defintiely not a good time to have serious discussions."
5,Nekotamo,243,"Wow! For the most part I felt like I read my own story. Thank you 1533jd! Thank you this forum! For giving me hope and feeling that I’m not the only one! For me it also started at the age of 15, at that time I had a surgery due to an injured arm (I think that itself explains a lot). Now if I really diagnose myself fully, those moments when I was saying to my friends: Something’s wrong with me, I cannot mentally and visually focus on things as clearly as when I was younger, I feel “less awake than before”, kind of like halfway asleep all the time would finally make sense 🙂"

1,raster,244,"I would stop with the detox diet and transition to the regular stage 1 anti-candida diet, this is too long to go on a detox. I am unsure how shoulder pain is related to candida; a few possibilities include that you have achy joints from mineral deficiencies. This is very common. A second reason is that your back could be out of alignment and you might need to go to a chiropractor. If you have achy joints, you need minerals and bunch of them! I personally take calcium, magnesium, zinc, iodine, and selenium. -raster"

0,ichigo13,245,"Four years ago I started to suffer from bad breath which really severed my life, I went to countless dentists and internal doctors for help but they would say there is nothing wrong with you, you’re just thinking too much. But I was sure that something is wrong, so I did some research four years ago and found out that candida might be culprit by doing the simple home test. This time I went to the doctor and requested for an endoscopy. My doctor was surprised to see yeasts forming in my esophagus. The doctor prescribed me with Diflucan. It was effective, I can still remember the 2 weeks of taking Diflucan was the worst because of the die off, and at the same time felt really good thinking my life would be back to normal again. But I was wrong, I thought by eliminating candida would free me from the foul gas coming out from my mouth. xD I went to a dentist specializing in curing people with halitosis. Spent thousand bucks. Telling me the root cause is the bad bacteria accumulating inside my mouth, unhealthy saliva etc. I did all their advice. Brush my teeth very well(which I always do even before going to them), floss it, scrub my tongue, take the mouthwash they prescribed me, drink water often, chew gums(to extract more saliva). I even had them pull out my wisdom teeth thinking tiny debris might be accumulating for bacterias to feast on. I believed by doing everything they say, it would boost my confidence to mingle with others and create more friends. But It only helped me a bit, I still feel somethings wrong with my breath. Mouth tastes metallic sometimes, shit sometimes, urine sometimes, I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know what I have done bad to have this illness. Why keep me from the most important and the most thing I like, create bond with my friends and families by communicating with them. I also can’t find a long lasting relationship because of me worrying about this too much. I know i need to work on my mentality too which is very important in improving our health. Four years ago, because of not much access to the things needed to do the candida diet. I never had the chance to try it. But NOW, its totally different, I am preparing to get all the needed antigungals, probiotics, recipes to try this candida diet to see how it would go for me. I am a little scared and also excited when I think optimistically of the result I would get from this long journey. Is there who has done candida diet solely to eliminate bad breath? Or anyone who has been worried of foul breath and thought that candida is the culprit?"
1,fscott,245,"I am sorry that you have had to suffer so long with this problem. I’ve found that my candida-related breath issues can be kept under control by doing two things: 1.) I put a good amount of sea-salt on my tongue, leaving it there for about five minutes before spitting it out. 2.) After rinsing out the salt, I open up a probiotic capsule and pour the contents onto my tongue. I then use my toothbrush to spread the probiotic all over the tongue surface. I keep the probiotic in my mouth anywhere from 5-20 minutes before swallowing. I usually don’t use a whole capsule; the amount you use will vary with the strength of the probiotic. These things have helped me significantly over the last few weeks. I am hoping that it is a long term solution and that they remain effective in the future. I usually repeat these steps 2-3 times throughout the day. Hope this helps. Whether or not you have candida, I would think these things could prove effective against the bacteria causing your bad breath. (Also, don’t use table salt. I’ve heard that it can be harmful.)"
2,fscott,245,"I just re-read your post. I had forgotten that the doctor found candida in your esophagus. As this is the case, perhaps the bad breath is coming not from your mouth but from your throat, in which case the methods I suggested might not get the job done. I would still give it a try though, as it’s easy and relatively cheap."

Hi, since you have said your breath smells fecal or of urine sometimes suggests that this is not the average bad breath that some people suffer from. There are people who suffer from rare disorders that can cause them to smell of unusual substances such as feces, urine, bad eggs, garbage, onions, sulphur etc. The odor can originate from different places depending on the person so some people have it come from their breath, others in their body odor, feet, sweat etc. I suffer from fecal body odor. Unfortuanately there is currently little research but there is a charity http://www.bloodbornebodyodorandhalitosis.com/# who are currently investigating the cause of these disorders through doing small informal research studies. They have found out that people who complain of unusual body odors often have a bacterial overgrowth, which is probably not a cause of the condition but could play a part. They have several ideas about what the cause could be which are metabolic: TMAU, isolated persistent hypermethionemia, a deficient FMO3 gene. You can find out more about the disorders here and take part in the research studies if you wish:http://meboresearch.org/ Support website where you will find others with similar problems:  http://breathandbodyodour.proboards.com/ Here you may find some more specific answers to controlling the odor!"

I don’t know much about it, but I do remember having a friend in school with very bad breath and it was hard for her to make friends because of it.

I couldn’t tell her either (I was too shy, and only 11 years old), but at least I forced myself to ignore it and to be her friend. She was so grateful and I’m glad I was her friend, although it was hard.

It is really hard to improve your social life when you have this kind of problem. I do not know actually what the real problem is. My dentist told me before that it is because of the bad bacteria (too much) inside my mouth. I did all her advises to control the bad bacteria to its normal level but the problem is I don’t thinks its working. Since I had this history of having a candida in my esophagus before, I thought that I need to restore my health back to normal by doing a candida diet. I am moving on to stage 2 now after 6 days of doing the cleansing. Now I have this rashes all over my body and its so itchy. Anyway, Never heard it before. but I will definitely do a research on that oil pulling. BTW Does your friend still suffer from halitosis? My cousin used to have a bad breath when he was 11-13 yo but it is now gone. I think that certain kid can have that because they their immune system is now yet fully developed or something.

Maybe you know the following already, but do some research if you hadn’t heard about it yet. To have good breath, you need to have very healthy intestinal bacteria. I don’t have links to share about that (and no time to look), but I’ve heard this mentioned at health lectures I attended years ago. Find the best probiotics you can find and take lots of them!

Eat yogurt, fermented foods, etc. and don’t do anything that kills your good bacteria (antibiotics, chlorinated water, bad diet, etc.). You asked somewhere else how to avoid losing weight on the candida diet. In my opinion, it’s not possible. I’ve never know anyone who followed a candida diet who didn’t become very thin. Unless you are SURE you have candida overgrowth, I don’t recommend following the strict diet. Find one of those online questionnaires about candida and figure out whether candida is really your problem. If you decide to follow the diet, I think you should be sure to use plenty of fat (like coconut oil, butter, olive oil, meat with fat, etc.) for energy, since you aren’t getting much carbohydrate. I will try to remember to check back and see how you’re doing!"

But good to hear(envy)it was controlled by these products. Actually my dentist, specializing in curing bad breath prescribed me to use the Therabreath spray and other products from the US that would oxygenate my mouth to prevent bad bacteria from multiplying. It made me feel alive and confident at first but after a week or so, the bad taste or bad smell of the saliva that dried when I lick the back of my hand (which I always do to check my breath). From the start of my ordeal. I had the speculation that the root cause of this bad breath is the disturbed flora in my guts. I had IBS until I start taking probiotics last month. To my surprise, the diarrhea after a 2-3 days of constipation is gone. I have regular bowel movement now, which makes me feel really good. So I resolved to get a more powerful and good probiotics and continue on using it even when I stopped the diet. With the yogurt and fermented food. It has became my routine to take yogurt as a snack and eat handmade kimchi recently. I am very motivated and enjoying eating healthy diet now from the improvements that I never felt before. BTW Oil pulling is amazing. Gives me power and energy. I liked it. I never neglect to put a teaspoon of sesame oil in my mouth when I wake up. Thank you so much for referring me to this great old but so effective method. With regards to prevent losing weight. Yes I am sure about having a candida because I had it 4 years ago in my esophagus and I do not think It was completely eradicated by Diflucan I had for 2 weeks. Cured the candida in my esophagus but they just migrated somewhere in my body. So I am continuing to do the diet until I am satisfied that the flora in my gut is back from being imbalanced. And my immune system is not suppressed anymore. This is all going to be self-diagnosis. I’ll take your advice to get lots of foods rich in fats. Luckily, I am a big fan of coconut oil, olive oil and butter. Thank you again DianaBanana."

I am currently undergoing the candida diet solely to eliminate bad breath, even though i know that eating meat alot will give me bad breath. but i’m looking to get rid of or just get used to the candida diet so that i can control candida first before reducing my meat daily intake (because i feel so hungry if i just eat vegies and a few pieces of meat). But whenever i eat sweet foods or the time when i ate so much white bread (refined carbs) i’d get this taste on my tongue that wouldn’t go away and it tasted yucky like a really deep taste that took over my whole mouth kind of thing and my mouth felt so dry. i wonder if you get that problem too when you have eaten refined carbs? Or anyone who has been worried of foul breath and thought that candida is the culprit? I think candida is one of the culprits for me (the other one is protein: meat) because whenever i eat anything with a dough (such as samosa, pies (any pies), bread), or ketchup , or soups (i think they put yeast in it), sugary foods, cakes, sweet foods, alcohol, basically gluten, yeast, and sugary foods then i get that really sickening taste on my tounge and when i breathe through my mouth (like just one or puffs in the air in front of me) then i can smell this strong smell. I wonder if you get that too? And also a white tounge? Thanks Ichigo13"
13,ichigo13,245,"Sorry for the late reply flamingo. I don’t get the metallic taste anymore, but still get the strong smell whenever I try to open my mouth. It is strong but because I got used to it I can’t tell what smell it is anymore. I think that candida alone is not the main culprit. I agree to what you said that It could be the meat or foods we eat that gives different smells of our breath. During my first 1 week of only eating veggies and few weeks after that, I am sure that my breath got better. My tongue’s color became pinkish too. But when I slowly eat more meat (more on white meat) the strong smell started again. But no more, sewage, metallic tastes like before. Also the white coating came back but I think it have the normal white coating on my tongue. Until now I am following the diet but there are instances when I have to eat outside which is inevitable for me. Though I am eating outside I choose the foods served does not have sugar, wheat and alcohol. I could tell the food I ate is not good because there are changes in my bowel movement, texture and color. My problem now is that I do not know the candida is gone or not because I do not get any die off symptoms. I only got it twice. First was after 1 week of eating only veggies. Second is after one week of the first die off. Oh yeah I also observed that Coconut aminos and apple cider vinegar contributed to the strong smell. I hope I could be of help by sharing my experience."
14,seema,245,"Bad breath caused due to candida can only be helped by eradicating candida from the root. Candida lives and grows in moist and dark places. Once it gets into your blood,finding way to your mouth becomes easier. The best way is to eliminate the root cause of bad breath first which is candida in your gut."
0,shuhu,246,"Hi I am 30 years old, female and started the Candida diet about a month ago. My first candida “symptoms” appeared almost 15 years ago and after tons of doctors and wrong diagnosis I found my current Dr… I was also diagnosed with ADHD and the meds do worked for me, so I know it is a condition I have, and not just a symptom of candida. I pretty much feel terrible all the time: nausea, unexplained muscle pains, fatigue, feeling weak, loss of memory and concentration, headaches, stomac pain and so many gastrointestnfal issues, horrible PMS, bloating, insomnia and sleepiness, dizziness, lightheaded, etc etc. Recently I became even more ill to the point of not being able to go to work, fortunately I live with my mom and brother, and I´ve felt so sick that I even stopped looking for a job cause I would most likely be fired by now many many times. Lately there is not a single day that I feel 100% fine. I was not even able to eat anything without feeling bloated inmediatelly with constant pain and fatigue 🙁 I am still going through the TERRIBLE DIE OFF symptoms, but I am sticking to my diet and the meds to wear of the candida. Besides all of these issues, MY MAIN PROBLEM is that my family DOES NOT really SUPPORT ME, I mean they are always saying that its all in my head, and that I should simply “think” about feeling better, and go-out/get-up and that I will eventually feel better, and that me stayin home or in bed is making me feel worse. My (older) brother even says that I should shake-it-off and get over it, and that thats how life works, bla bla bla, and that people still go to work when they feel sick cause they have responsabilities and that if he can do it, then why can´t I too? But they dont get that I used to be up and active for many years feeling myserable and that I have come to a point were no matter how POSITIVE thinking I try, the sickness simple does not go away. I simply don´t know what to say to friends, ex-coworkers, family members and even to future employers. I mean, how do you explain not having a job for so long and not attending social events and such because of feeling sick???!!! I always say that I have been feeling sick with gastrointestinal problems, but I can´t really explain to others why I been having them for soooo long. People(including family) just think I am being lazy and confty ;´( which makes me very sad and desperate. All of this combined with my ADHD symptoms its ruinning my life and my little social life, or what´s left of it. So, What do you say to them??? :/ It´s like my ADHD all over again, I have NO WAY to support my disease and most people simply dont “buy it”. I really hope this was a more “tangible” condition, or better yet not have it at all LOL. PS: Sorry for the long post."
1,raster,246,I would suggest educating yourself further about candida so you can talk to whoever you want about it because you will sound perfectly logical. You can get some testing done to prove it if you wanted. How long have you been on the diet? -raster
2,shuhu,246,"Thanks for your reply I have educated myself regarding Candida, I´ve read so much my eyes are tired LOL, though maybe I havent been able to fully translate it into simple words for other people to understand me. Unfortunatelly, the reason that I am asking this here is because most people, if not all the people who have felt healthy all their lives, do not believe in Candida. and the few that are open minded dont really get it, or its symptoms. Like I said before, even my own family who have seen me struggle with this for years, dont really understand how I cannot manage it myself and “shake it off” like apparently people do in “the responsible adults world”, I mean, for them is like an excuse that I feel sick. Now try to explain that to a person who does not live with you, and does not get to see your symptoms everyday, I dont know about you but I dont go out yelling my symptoms out in public to everyone, so, most people dont even notice that you are feeling misserable and sick, and if they do they think its just a flu. So, I have tried explaining it and I can inmediatelly see the look on their faces, when people nod their face but you know they dont really buy what you are saying, or simply refuse to believe in something that is not scientifically proved… I mean, even “real” diseases like my ADHD are not fully accepted and understood by everyone, so now try to explain a disease that allopatic doctors don´t even support. So, that is why I came to this forum, to understand how to tell other people, unfamiliar with Candida and its symptoms, why I cant fully function without being “medically” sick. =/"

How long have you been trying to get over candida? -raster Thanks I will try that simple aproach. It “started” like 15 years ago (in my teen years), I was treated with the Candida Diet 1 year or so later, I felt better inmediatelly after the diet, months later I simply forgot about it, but have always had several recurring mild sicknesses since then, I never related them to Candida though, these have become more and more intense and frequent over the years. A whole new batch of intense symptoms started several months ago… probably more than a year ago… after seing a Gastroenterologists and a Gynecologist with no positive results, my mom suggested the same “Candida” Dr. who is both Allopath and Holistic, I didn´t even think it could be Candida before she mentioned it. So, I have been on the Diet for a month now, which confirmed Candidiasis inmediatelly. I am still struggling with it, as it seems to be severe this time. =("

7,titan,246,"You can give people the “cliff notes” version of your journey. I tell people this version, and if they want to know more, I tell them a little bit more. Keep it simple so you don’t come across as “foggy”, especially since brain fog and confusion are symptoms. I usually say, “I’ve contracted this yeast allergy…it’s pretty rare, and not too many doctors know about it. The good news is there’s a cure, it’s just a long term restrictive diet and probiotics to fix my immune system…now, how have you been?” You’ve got to sell yourself and turn the focus on others. This method has saved me unneeded skepticism and long rumbling conversations that only opened up the wounds of my pain. By coming off as strong and determined to others, you will feel this way at the end of the night, and wake up with a smile on your face the next day. Small steps, small progress. Another piece of advice, it’s not your job to make people believe in this condition. I paid for this dearly as I pushed people away that didn’t support me, when all you need is your own belief and CONVICTION. People will be skeptical, and this is the world we live in. Just accept it, be a better person, and one day this will all be behind you. I can tell you as someone who is feeling better on month 4 of the protocol, you don’t need people’s belief to get better. They’ll see the new you soon enough, and you’ll be wiser for the entire experience."

1,hope4eva77,247,i also have serious brain fog
2,raster,247,"Here’s a general treatment plan we put together on the forum: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx I would not take psyllium because it can cause internal bleeding and constipation that lasts for days. If you can consult a naturopathic doctor and spend some money, you likely can heal much faster and better than the anti-candida plans you find on the internet. You don’t need this many antifungals and should only go with 2-3 max. Pau d’arco is pretty weak and wouldn’t waste your money on it. I would invest in some milk thistle, hydro-chloric acid (zypan or betaine HCL), pro-gest digestive enzymes, 2 antifungals, a high count high strain probiotic, and L-glutamine. The last thing you will want once you get better is sugar. -raster"

8,raster,247,"Hello Hope4eva, I would carefully examine your living situation for mold problems because this alone can cause yeast/candida issues. I know because my bathroom had mold and it spread throughout the rest of my apartment. I lived there for 2 years and my landlord painted over the mold over and over before I lived there and thats all he did to treat the problem. Additionally, I would consider trying out acupuncture to help reduce stress. You won’t get better if you don’t get your stress under control. A great way to reduce sugar cravings over time is to switch to eating fruit when you have cravings instead of eating sugar. Fruit is allowed on some candida diets (not ours) but is a great way to get your blood sugar under control. HCL is great for digestion; almost everyone who has candida overgrowth has a deficiency in stomach acids. We have tons of advice on how to reduce constipation, check out this post: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1098_Constipation-Remedies.aspx A great way to reduce costs on purchasing organic meat is to purchase it online. You also shouldn’t eat too much of it on the diet so it shouldn’t cost too much more. You won’t recover any faster with more antifungals. -raster"
9,hope4eva77,247,ok thank u im considering acupuncture its very expensive but maybe i can do it temporally and ill check the link out thanks im going to add green apples in but i think im gonna do a strict cleanse first though i may wait till i get my l glutamate 1st thanks so much ill be coming back to this forum daily for support i appreciate the advice
10,hope4eva77,247,i will inspect the mold the best i can i think my issue is from antibiotics on long term last year for pelvic pain unnecessary also !
0,weehen,248,"I just thought I’d start this story of my kids as a place to track what we have done and hopefully share both our discoveries and mistakes with others. Daughter, age 7 – has had slight eczema, particularly in creases of elbows and knees, which flares up badly in the heat. As a baby she has constant ear infections with high fever, and as a result took lots of antibiotics. (I know better now – drops of H2O2 are the best thing for an ear infection, and since I found that out we have never had that issue). However, we have always had some behavioral issues, and these have become worse over time. I have long suspected candida (since I myself have been through it, and am still prone to it if I am not careful). So based on that I have tried numerous dietary supplements to help: – coconut oil – hates the taste – oil of oregano – worked for me, but it is such a strong taste and is very potent I’m not sure it is suitable for a child, even in tiny doses – sauerkraut and kim chi- hates the taste – water kefir – hates the taste, even with multitude of flavors and concoctions The only dietary thing that is easy: she will swallow pills and capsules. I’m going to get gel cap form of coconut oil and see if we can get started on that daily. We just saw an excellent doctor today (integrative) and he prescribed gluten free/dairy free diet and daily probiotics and magnesium (to calm the ADHD symptoms). I’m scared about this diet…I’m on it myself, so I know how to cook, but Christmas and kids in school and avoiding sugar, wheat and milk products? Well, it is not easy with a resistant, uncooperative child…but we will try. Doctor said we can consider antifungals in February, but I will continue to cook with coconut oil, and see about gel caps in the meantime. Son, age 5 – has moderate to severe eczema, same places, but flares up to cover entire body and causes total misery, loss of sleep, and inability to do anything but scratch like crazy (can’t even sit in a chair and hold a pencil when it is like this). Like his sister, he had ear infections as a baby, as well as SEVERE dairy intolerance….to the point where I could not even nurse him unless I was 100% dairy free or he would just instantly projectile vomit. He was put on Zantac to reduce the heartburn associated. He has some ADHD symptoms too – very distracted and can’t sit still or focus in school, but I think most of this is actually due to the itching he is constantly feeling. He is unable to swallow pills and capsules, but loves apple sauce, so I crunch stuff up and mix it into a couple of teaspoons of apple sauce and he enjoys me making a joke out of spoon feeding him like a baby.  – won’t eat coconut oil straight, but doesn’t hate the taste when I cook with it – likes almond milk and rice milk (phew!) – loves eggs…but we suspect possible allergy, so have to watch those – also hates sauerkraut and kim chi – also hates water kefir, but loves milk kefir (which we can’t have – casein) I also give both of them: – fish oil – cod liver oil – multivitamin – kale when I can sneak it into things – sauerkraut and sauerkraut juice when I can sneak it into things – water kefir when I can sneak it in So that is our story so far….wish us luck!  (My own story: moderately good success with oil of oregano and dietary changes, but I still have to be careful and avoid sugar or I get a flare up)"
1,fje,248,"You are a good parent! A lot of your kids’ symptoms sounds like me at a young age – I grew out of it/was treated with medicine. When my mom’s friend went on the candida diet it clicked that that is probably what I had all along (and still have, obviously). Great that you are trying to get this under control when they are young – its a lot harder the longer you have it! Best of luck!"
2,weehen,248,"Thank you for the supportive comment, fje! Yes, I know what you mean…my brothers and I also had these symptoms and mostly outgrew them, but I still believe candida is the root cause, or one of the root causes… My kids are now taking “Attentive Child” supplement. It has a small anti-fungal component, but mostly magnesium. Behaviour is looking good but it is early days. Still seeking a small enough capsule with coconut oil/caprylic acid that my kids can actually swallow or chew up."
0,raster,249,"“I was just having a cigarrette after ‘smoking it up’ and then all of the symptoms hit me. I felt like I could’ve passed out at any time. And then because I was worrying about it, it made it worse.”  This is the beginning of my epic candida related story. Hi I’m raster and I am a fairly young guy new to the forum. I lived in a “nice” apartment in 2010 without a fan in the bathroom(health code violation). I was out of work for 2 years because its a tough economy. I did nothing but sit on my ass and apply for jobs all day long and complete training. Barely any fun at all being broke. I drank a lot of beer, smoked a ton, stayed up late, and ate a very poor diet consisting of nothing but dairy and grains. I lived with the mold for 2 years (located in the bathroom) and it never got cleaned because I didn’t think it was harmful, and I barely noticed it (and im an idiot). Should have just taken a sponge with some bleach to it…but I was busy looking for a job! My health slowly declined, but I barely noticed it because I just felt bad from being unemployed in general. Then the ‘event’ happened. After the first sentence happened, I had sharp pains, tremors, limp body feelings, etc for the first time. It was really scary. I felt I was going to have a stroke or heart attack that night and my anxiety made my blood pressure race. After feeling fatigue after these symptoms, I decided to go to the hospital because I was all over the place. I did not know what was happening to me, I thought I was going to have a heart attack. The ER said that I have “hyperventilation. Its a physiological condition, meaning its unrelated to smoking and eating poorly. Its related to how well my body is physically.”  They said “If my body cannot regulate its own CO2 levels, then it will give me those symptoms and my body will want to shut down. Some people can pass out from it, but to get over it, I just have to breathe in a bag.”  This is how toxic candida my reaction was the first time. I thought it was hyperventilation at first (according to ER), then mold poisoning (self diagnosis), but in reality, it probably was an extremely toxic candida reaction. Maybe about the most toxic you can get considering my diet and lifestyle. I still have no idea for certain what it was I had, but ever since that I day I started on my path of discovery. I did blood tests with crummy doctors, then had my brain EKG’d for unusual activity. Still no idea what caused the seizures and what caused candida. Did everything the doctor’s recommended as far as getting healthier(other than quittin smoking). Still no reference to candida or mold poisoning, they didn’t even think it was possible. I moved the heck out of that place after having seizures regularly in my sleep night after night. One night, every time I went to sleep I had a seizure. Around that time, I started to get a reaction to regular yogurt for the first time. I knew something wasn’t right. Food didn’t taste very good and I was extremely tired. Then, I started to have my first regular daily candida symptoms. Inability to cope with any amount of stress, headaches, excessive fatigue, problems with my blood sugar levels, cravings for alcohol, anxiety, hair loss, massive cravings for sweets, inability to think clearly or concentrate, struggling to speak/stuttering, hyperactivity, mood swings, inability to focus on simple tasks that were easy only months before, diarrhea then constipation, constipation then diarrhea, body itching, rectal itching, night sweats, depression, dizziness, poor memory, minor earaches, low sex drive, muscle weakness, joint pain, extreme irritability, learning difficulties, extreme sensitivity to cigarette smoke, heart palpitations, cognitive impairment, skin rashes, food allergies, abdominal gas and bloating, muscle spasms, tremors, and seizures in my sleep. I lost a lot of hair rapidly and I looked ill and pale. I thought I had cancer or something. Lost 10-20 pounds and was not hungry. I weighed 145 and am 6ft. I decided it was time to sleep elsewhere because I felt so bad in that apartment. I noticed I felt good when I wasn’t there only. I tried out my girlfriends place for a night. The environment seemed so much cleaner at her place…it was like going on a vacation; I could finally breathe well for the first time in a week! Wow, clean air! Still was having seizures though…I did some detective work, and removed the carpet that had about 1 in of dust underneath it. After that night I never had seizures again. It also was the night I started to change my life. I learned more about toxic mold poisoning and I read up a little tiny bit on candida. I just figured that the mold made me so ill that I needed to detox from that only. This candida thing didn’t sound so serious when compared to that, I mean, it’d be easy to get that out of my body, right? During the next 5 months I slowly was feeling better. Not as much hyperventilation, no more weight loss, a little happier…overall improvement bottom line. The only problem was I noticed I had “reactions” to nearly everything I ate. It no longer was hyperventilation but an allergic reaction. I just figured that it’d go away eventually. I had this the whole time after that first paragraph and just thought it was the mold in my body reacting to the food I ate. Altering my diet even more, I felt that what I was eating the next month was “good enough” to get better. Wrong. I went “all organic” on my food and started acupuncture. I then tried removing more foods; I read up more on candida and you have got to do a strict diet removing all of the foods that I love. Every single item. No more drinking with friends! A few months later I knew I had candida because I wasn’t getting better. I then did the spit test and it came back positive. It all made sense. Starting 20+ weeks ago (today’s date) I have been on the candida diet as best as I can. I am failing some on it, but I think I can do it eventually. Considering how good I feel now, I feel that I have overcome a lot. The only problem is that I am only halfway there, and I need to purify myself of this villain even more. I have done a number of things incredibly wrong for these 8 weeks and I just hope that I can get over it completely. Starting month 2 no more dairy (except greek yogurt) and no more rice. I am going to start eating different foods and no more coffee. I will let you how I feel in another 8 weeks, but I feel that I have killed off 50-90% of the candida so far. This is when compared to 9 months or longer ago; but I wont ever really know for sure because I’ve been ill for so long. All I know is that I once was having seizures and now I can do normal things again like have sex. I also know that each time I refined my diet it was still not good enough. I just wish I knew more at the beginning and what I was actually ill with the first time. I wish I tried this diet sooner. I wish I felt good a long time ago. I just hope I can have a beer on my wedding day. This is the most intense thing I have ever had to deal with in my life and I look forward to the day I can eat normal food again (if possible). The recession has ruined my life but now I am onto the road of recovery. Cheers! My half-ass road to recovery if you want to do it pain-stakingly slow and pathetic: Month 1)Cut all non-organic food from diet. Fruit juice is not allowed. Eat a salad once a day. Month 2)Cut all white sugar and alcohol from diet. I used to drink 3 days a week! One candy bar a day, bag of gummy bears once a week. Stop it! Month 3)Cut all fast food and condiments. I used to eat out daily or sometimes twice a day. Start acupuncture! Month 4-7)Slowly reduce frequency of acupuncture, cut all honey, cane sugar, and sub-sugars. Eat nothing but pasta, hamburgers, salads, chicken and rice. take more vitamins. Month 8)Start strict anti-candida diet (mine wasn’t good enough first time through, I had dairy, rice, coffee, regular yogurt, salad dressing). Month 9)Continue strict anti-candida diet. Stop dairy, rice, coffee, regular yogurt, salad dressing and any other bad foods. Start some supplements. Months 10)Continue anti-candida diet. Start new supplements. Month 11)Started naturopathic supplements after consulting an alternative doctor; 2 days of recovering with these supplements feels like 2 weeks before I went to doctor. How strange…I am recovering so fast! I think I am going to eat some pizza or hamburger soon, it is not far away at last! Month 12)Symptom free except for (adrenal) fatigue. No reactions to bad foods and eating potatoes on weekends. Still on the candida diet, but won’t be on it forever because I know I need to gain some weight! I could’ve just started month 12 at month 1 and I would’ve been almost better now! Remember, no cheating! -Raster"

I was shocked to find out about Candida. The shocking thing was that I had lots of the symptoms but never dreamed that they were connected. I always have ear infections or at least ear irritation and itchiness. I get unexplainable rashes. Sometimes I’ll have a sore throat for weeks at a time. I crave sugar like crazy. Alcohol too. I try my best to hide it or change it but the truth is that I am a very grumpy, irritable person. I’m ambitious but often exhausted so I drink coffee and make myself go go go. Every time I get a Pap smear I have a low grade (unnoticeable to me) yeast infection. My joints and muscles ache. I have siatica. My brain get pretty foggy and its often difficult for me to be fully present. The list goes on too. About the only symptom I don’t have is digestion problems but the more I read the more I learn that it’s possible that I do have leaky gut or other issues but not bad enough to have the noticeable symptoms.  So it wasn’t difficult to see how this could have happened to me. When I was 12 or so I got some kind of terrible skin infection on my face and a doctor proscribed tetracycline which I took for months. I don’t remember exactly but I may have taken it for a year even. It cleared up my acne and being young a dumb that was really important so I kept getting more.  So I did the cleanse for a week and wow! it was difficult but I didn’t cheat. I had terrible die-off. 2days of which was really dibilitating. Then I started the strict diet. I was a bit confused in the beginning so I cheated unknowingly with rice and rice crackers but I think I’ve got it right now. Here are the foods I’m eating: Lots of veggies (on allowed list only) especially garlic and rudabaga Eggs Coconut or buckwheat bread Oat groats Buckwheat cereal Greek plain yogurt Chicory coffee with stevia and coconut cream Homemade water kefir with lemon and ginger Cabbage rejuvalac (fermented cabbage drink) Also taking 6 -10 tspn coconut oil Pau de arco tea Nettle tea Milk thistle powder GSE (rotating with caprylic acid) And loads of pills Swanson probiotics Dr Steven Langers  Caprylic acid Bavarian herbal bitters Biotin Lactoferrin Chelated molybdenum Vitamin C Vitamin D3 Oregano oil (I start this tomorrow) Cranberry extract Calcium magnesium and zinc Vitamin E I also have some undecenoic acid coming in the mail. So at about a month in I feel foggier than ever and even more tired than usual. I wake up with a headache that sometimes persists all day. My joint and muscle pain seems better and my skin looks great. My ears are itchy as usual but not infected and my throat is still sore. There is some kind of jabbing pain internally where I think my left kidney is and that is starting to worry me. I’ve always suspected that I have weak kidneys (I’ve had infections). So I still have loads of questions about what I should be doing. I’ve been reading and researching but if anyone has any input I would appriciate it. I’m wondering if there are some of these supplements that have special requirements in taking them.. such as “don’t take A and C together” or “Don’t take A within 2 hous of eating X”… I’m just taking handfuls of pills and powders and I know our bodies and its processes are complicated and there is so much I don’t know. I am trying to take the probiotics 2 hours before and after all food and anti fungals.  Another question: how do I know there isn’t residual sugar in my water kefir after the fermentation time is complete. Also since the bacteria eat up the sugar does that mean its okay to add fruit? Won’t I just get fruit flavor but no sugar? Also on the days that I make coconut bread I have a hard time not eating it all up, it is so yummy and filling. This makes me wonder if I should be trying to count or guesstimate my carb intake. If my craving had their way I would just eat the bread, yogurt and eggs. I’m not saying I would do this, but what if I did? So if anyone has answers, comments or criticisms I’d love the feedback.  Thanks."
0,Alex22,251,"Since I posted this in the lonley part of the forum I’m posting it here as well. Ok, so I’m 22 years old and my life turned upside down in a day. I even remember the exact day, march 19th 2010——> Fuck that day. I was 19, feeling great and was a picture of perfect health. I was going to the gym almost every day, I was eating a lot of protein, living a healthy life, confident, happy, my body looked like I could star in an action movie. I never smoked, drank or did drugs, yet my body started messing with me for no reason. Constipation, diharea,incomplete bowel movments, chills, feeling of heat through my body ( stomach,back, shoulders, legs), sometimes it felt like a had a fever,yet I didn’t have one. At times it would also seem I had trouble with my bladder, like I would have to pee a lot and the pee would be really yellow, also the first few months I would take very little dumps and notice some blood on my paper when I wiped, The blood went away after a few months and the condition got a bit better. I had a colonoscopy done, they didn’t find anything. After a year passed my stomach also started giving me trouble, I felt bloated and like my stomache didn’t work properly. Went to the doctor and they checked me out, told me I had gastro reflux. I chaged my diet a bit and removed dairy, that’s how my situation got a bit better, well more tolerateble, but it’s still wasn’t quit gone. So now 1 year later I got another problem, anxiety and panic attacks, brain fog, hard time concetrating. (The anxiety seems to get better when I change my state of mined, for exp. feel really confident and feel like nothing can touch me. And I recently noticed some white stringy stuff in my stool, this lead me to beliave that I could have candida. I realize I wrote a lot more on here that just about the diet, but I wrote my experiance I guess, so that I could be understood better. Now as far as the diet. I think I have been on it 2 days and I have to teel you, I feel terrible! I am reluctant to continue it until I got to the doctor and they actually diagnose me with candida. Also, how do I get this thing diagnosed? Now keep in my that the things that I have been eating before the diet were: eggs with some brown bread, brown bread with chicken pate, wholegrain sphagetti with tomato sauce and garlic sesoning and oat cereal with soy or rice milk. For these past 2 days I have cut out regular food wheat, pate, sphagetti, i did have a bit of oat cereal, but I have been eating chicken breast meat, green salad with garlic, eggs, okay maybe a tiny bit of brown bread with eggs ,but just tiny. Let me tell you I feel like shit. When I went to piss a had this brown burning urin and felt like my bladder was on fire, after I passed the urin the bladder felt better, my leg muscle and joints feel tender and beat up a bit, I feel confused a bit and weak, also feel as it’s hard to think lol and concenrate, feels like my anxiety is a bit worse( all this after 2 days on the diet?) What the hell do I do next? Anyone got any advice. This thing has taken and trashed my life for about 2 years, these were supposed to be the best years of my life and I can’t get them back. So, I’m I out of line in thinking this can be candida? Or am I just loosing my mind. I appriciate any advice on this matter and sorry for the long text."

2,titan,251,"Your story sounds a lot like mine. I didn’t know if I had Candida until I went on the strict forum diet and I felt the symptoms of vision, constipation, etc. lift within weeks. But then I started taking antifungals and probiotics, which cause major die off symptoms. It’s your choice. I didn’t get diagnosed, I went to every local doctor and they were no help. I was in shape, married, and happy. I got sick overnight too. But you have your whole life ahead of you. If its Candida, then it can take 4-18 months to fix, avoiding heavy exercise until you are symptom free."
3,Ashley1988,251,"Hi Alex, I’m new on here too and I haven’t yet started the candida diet, I’m just reading up first. But I was reading through your story and symptoms and I wonder if you know anything about a condition called Gastroparesis (it basically means that your stomach or intestines are semi-paralysed. It sounds like you have something more than acid reflux. I have gastroparesis and there are lots of symptoms but it really varies with each person. Some of my symptoms are slow digestion, chronic nausea, anxiety, headaches, fatigue, acid reflux sometimes. I came down with it after a bad episode of food poisoning, but my doctors recently found out that I have something else called Joint Hypermobility Syndrome which could have been the trigger. Anyway, my point is you should find out about this? Also, I get a yeast infection every month before my period and then it goes away. I never had this before I had problems with my stomach. I am trying to find the route cause. What are your candida symptoms? All the best, Ashley x"
4,Angel29,251,"Hi Alex, During an extremely stressful time in my life I too, suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so I totally understand. Please just remember that you are not in any real danger during a panic attack even though it feels like you’re dying. You have to keep telling yourself, “I’m going to be okay, my body is just going through fight or flight…I will be okay.” And then breath through it and let it pass. There’s an excellent book called, “The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook,” it is what got me through my panic attacks. Your local library may have it. Good luck and just remember you ARE going to be okay. As far as doctors go–don’t be too confident, most don’t know anything about Candida. My doctor is a great guy but when I told him about it, he just laughed and said, “you’re reading nonsense on the internet.” I’ve honestly lost hope in doctors; you must rely on yourself."
5,slowsmile,251,Hi Alex22…If you want to save on doctor’s bills and find out whether you do have candida for sure then just take the test below — it works off a point scoring system and will give you a fairly accurate diagnosis: Dr William Crook’s Candida Questionnaire Dr William Crook wrote The Yeast Connection which is all about overcoming yeast/candida problems. The book came out in the 1980s and was ground-breaking at the time. Another good book is Candida: The Missing Diagnosis by Dr Orian Truss which was all about modern medicine’s apparent inability to even recognize or diagnose candida(as the book title suggests).
0,janemadi,252,"Hi everyone, I felt compelled to post on this website because I’ve spent so much time researching and browsing here over the past year. You guys have provided me with lots of helpful info, so I feel I owe it to this community to share my experience. I’m hopeful that what worked for me will also work for you. Long story short, I started having problems with candida a couple years ago. One year ago I figured out that it was a candida issue and I began making the necessary changes. I did the diet, cleanses and took a variety of antifungals. I even did a special cleanse under the supervision of my doctor who claims to have had lots of success clearing up candida problems. The problem is that all of these efforts only seemed to manage the problem. As long as I was strictly monitoring my diet, I would be fine w/ few symptoms and flare ups, but as soon as I slipped up in my diet it appeared I was right back at square one. In other words, I didn’t seem to be making any long term headway. Then I started having random bouts of nausea after eating, and it took me a couple months of progressively worsening bouts to figure out what was triggering them. It turns out that the seemingly random list of foods that were bringing about the nausea had one characteristic in common: They were all very high oxalate foods. Spinach, almonds, chia seeds, sweet potato, etc. I started cutting out high oxalate foods and limiting medium oxalate foods and the nausea totally went away. By the way, at this point I had ceased all candida protocols, mostly out of frustration. Anyway, the point of this story is that being on the low oxalate diet for just a few weeks totally cleared up my candida symptoms. Out of both curiosity and disbelief, I even tried pushing my body and trying foods that used to cause horrible candida flare ups (beer, sweets, etc) and… nothing, no reaction. Of course the unexpected resolution of a health problem that I thought was totally unrelated to the one I was trying to address caught me off guard, so I’ve been doing some research to try to understand the mechanism behind my healing. It turns out that low oxalate diets have proven very helpful in treating children with autism. Incidentally, autistic children frequently suffer from chronic candida problems, which tend to clear up on the low oxalate diets. A researcher named Susan Owens explains the possible link between oxalates and candida this way: [indent]”Candida is killed by releasing excess calcium intracellularly which is taken up by their mitochondria, probably inducing cell death. This increase of calcium can occur by various means, like having nystatin punching holes in the cell membrane, but oxalates, by binding that calcium, may prevent cell death. This may explain the relationship between having high oxalates and being less able to defend against candida.”[/indent] I took this from a document she posted in the files section of a yahoo group that called “Trying Low Oxalates”, which I would highly recommend joining if you even have a hint of interest in what I’m telling you. Anyway, I’m sure some reading this will think I’m making things up or that my experience was mere coincidence, but I’m sharing it with the hopes that some of you who are experiencing frustration like I was will give it a chance for a couple weeks and try going low oxalate. It’s not a difficult change to make, and it really could make all the difference. Here’s to a light at the end of the tunnel! Jane Madison"
1,raster,252,"Thank you for sharing your story. I found a link that shows high and low oxalate foods: http://www.ohf.org/docs/OxalateContent092003.pdf Out of my diet, buckwheat and rutabega are relatively high oxalate foods. I am interested in trying this but I don’t seem to feel bad or anything like that with high oxalate foods. I also don’t seem to be eating many… I am rather allergic to many low oxalate foods so am unsure if this will do anything either way. -raster"
2,MarkHolland,252,Thanks a lot for sharing this story.
3,ChinUp,252,"Thanks for sharing, Jane. Are you still on this diet? Thanks for that link Raster. I’m going to start trying to cut out some of the higher oxelates and see if it helps at all. I eat a lot of the greens included in that list. If I see an improvement, then I’ll cut out even more. Edit: Just noticed that the link on that site was from 2003. Here is a document from 2008 from the same site: http://www.ohf.org/docs/Oxalate2008.pdf"
4,janemadi,252,"I am still eating low oxalate for the most part, but I’m not being extremely strict about it. Mostly I’m just avoiding high oxalate foods. I’m not having any candida symptoms, and I’m not eating low carb/sugar at all. (Definitely not bragging about that because I’d like to eat healthy even when candida isn’t forcing me to, but I think I’m just enjoying the freedom a little too much right now. Hopefully I’ll start practicing healthier eating habits soon…) I also wanted to mention that there are lots of lists out there and the way they categorize the oxalate content of foods varies widely. I read somewhere that it’s because the process they use to test food has improved over time, so some foods that tested initially one way are now testing another. I’ve heard the example of blueberries – apparently, they were thought to be high oxalate for a long time, but were recently retested and deemed low or moderate (I can’t remember which). So pay attention to the source of the lists that you use and when they were published. Apparently the most current research is being done by the Vulvar Pain Foundation b/c oxalates are a cause of vulvar pain. From what I understand, they sell a cookbook that has a pretty exhaustive list in it. I didn’t end up ordering the cookbook because I experience positive results without having to get really strict about the diet, so the lists offered by the yahoo group I mentioned in my original post were sufficient. Btw, that group also has some info on supplements to take while trying to rid your body of oxalates. Admittedly, I was also pretty lax about that part. I purchased calcium citrate and magnesium citrate, and have taken them on and off, so they may have contributed to my success, but I can’t say for sure."
0,Chris24,253,"Hi guys, As I thought this forum could use a succes story I’d like to write about how I temporarily cured my candida and had a break from 8 years long chronic fatigue in jan/feb of last year. At the time I was volunteering in a vegan community in South-India, living in huts working with water conservation and eating local fresh vegan meals. I had two reasons to go there: 1: to get away from my life and open my world, and 2: to cure myself of my chronic fatigue which had been ruining my life for years. At least 4 of the 8 years of chronic fatigue were caused by candida. Before candida my chronic fatigue was diagnosed as a comorbid condition belonging to chronic depression. Not realizing I had candida, I had made the problem worse for years with alcohol and sugar abuse to deal with depression. So the candida was really bad and lodged in deep in the gut by the time I started to deal with it. My symptoms were: – Chronic fatigue – Brainfog, feeling completely spaced out – Rectal itching accompanied or caused by mucous secretion – White mucous/thrush on penis – Thrush on tongue – Constipation/irregular bowel movements – Bloating – Being out of breath a lot for no reason – Muscle pain in the legs/heavy legs – Dry eyes (wow, now I realize this is probably why i couldnt where contacts anymore: candida. Oh well, too late, I lasered.) – Feeling hot one moment and cold the next – Concentration problems – Depression So then it was time to take the plunge and start. I had no idea about this forum or specific protocols, all I knew from my on limited research was that I basically couldn’t eat anything anymore. The die off was hell on diet alone. I was totally incapacitated for 10 days, after which suddenly I noticed my strength coming back. I then started to take these supplements: –	pre and probiotic capsules (in one). No idea about the ingredients, strains, or bacteria count. It was cheap. But everything is cheap in India. –	Spirulina capsules. Someone was going on about its crazy health benefits, so I decided to take it. I had no idea about its fungal-inhibiting properties. –	Neem tree capsules. Neem tree has powerful medicinal qualities and is also a fungus inhibitor. –	B12 And two weeks later: –	Miracle Mineral Solution or: MMS. Someone in the community heard about my health problems and decided to treat me with MMS. She said that it once saved here life in Africa, curing here meningitis in 1 day. She also said that it completely cured cancer in a friend of hers. You are supposed to take MMS in combination with citric acid, because then it makes chlorine dioxide. Chlorine dioxide is the most powerful pathogen killer known to man. In two weeks I slowly went up to the maximum dose. All of these supplements I took together with meals 3 times a day, except the MMS which I took 2 times a day. I had no idea that antifungals could harm the effect of probiotics. After about 2 weeks (1 month in the diet) I started to up the dose of all the capsules till I took about 20 a day in total. My progress after the initial die-off was slow, at least I felt like that since I was so tired all the time. Now I realize it could have been a lot of die off. My diet in the community consisted of the following: –	Brown rice and coconut as staple foods. We had fantastic tasting brown rice grown not too far away, and awesome fresh local coconuts. There were periods where I would only eat this for days as it was about the only food that would make me feel good. –	Vegetables. Mostly onions and garlic with the rice. Also salads once or twice a day. Sometimes lentilsoup. –	Potatoes or sweet potatoes maybe once a week. South Indian food is the best food in the world. Seriously. So I couldn’t help but eat out and cheat a couple of times a week. –	Mostly chapatti’s with chutney. Chutney’s weren’t a problem (well maybe the tomatochutney) but chapatti’s are whole wheat flower pancakes. I don’t remember having bad reactions to them though. At the time I didn’t know it was not allowed on the diet. –	Samosa’s (deep fried white flower veggie snacks) Also I liked deep fried cauliflower. Strangely no direct damage felt. On a sidenote: I was also smoking a couple of times a week. The point of sudden health. I just woke up one day on week 7 or 8 and felt AMAZING. I was actually AWAKE, and alert. These sudden releases of energy normally would happen to me once or twice a year, lasting maybe a few hours, but this one lasted for 3 days. For the first time in 8 years, I was feeling awake and healthy for a whole day. Then another day, and another. It was incredible. I was happy. Then it went wrong. I was feeling so good that I got cocky and made the mistake of eating white rice. I was constipated for a full week, and did not regain my clarity after that. It took a lot of time to forgive myself for that stupid mistake. I also started eating sourdough bread with cashewbutter, as I didn’t know it was bad. 1 month later I left the community to head up north and thus didn’t get the chance to stay on a strict diet anymore. I still was taking capsules, and even started taking Fluconazole, but they didn’t help at all. Fluconazole only made me weak and pale. So, that was that. I spend the rest of the year on a half-ass diet, until the candida finally caught up on me fully again due to sugar, alcohol and depression. Now I’m trying only the MMS to see if it was that stuff which really cured me, and not the Spirulina or Neem. My MMS log can be found on the advice section of this forum. I thought it was interesting to show an alternative route to curing candida. As I was staying in a vegan community, I did not have fish, meat, dairy or eggs. I had no access to quality probiotics, and the probiotics that I was taking I was taking with meals, and with antifungals, jeopardizing its effectiveness. Spirulina and Neem are seldom named here, though may have played a big part. The cheats sound pretty bad, but still I was cured in under two months. Truly, a full disappearance of all the symptoms I’ve ever had. All of this raises questions to me. –	The questionable effectiveness of probiotics. If its true that you should take them on an empty stomach, and not with antifungals, then I was doing it really wrong. Could our belief in them be misplaced? EDIT: I was wrong to question this. I have been without probiotics for a week and doing worse. I must assume I did have decent ones in India, and even though taking them with food and antifungals, they still worked. –	The role of MMS. I was taking 2 fungal inhibitors (neem and spirulina), and 1 fungus killer (the MMS). Could the effect of all those together have caused my progress to be so fast? Was it just the MMS? Or are Spirulina and Neem the most powerful antifungals we can find? –	The possible detrimental effects of all animal products. Could it have been the veganism that gave my body the break it needed? My digestion has never been so good as when I was on the vegan diet. –	Does brown rice really feed candida? I was having brown rice 3 times day, and never had a bad reaction to it. I guess that was it. I hope some people may find inspiration in this, that there is a way to cure their condition. I know how hopeless a chronic disease can make you feel. But we must keep pushing because there is a way out. No one should be the victim of this disease, whether you call it CFS or candida albicans. There is cure, and we have to fight for it. Energy is our natural state, and happiness is our birthright! Lots of love to my fellow sufferers, Chris"
1,sophie,253,"I’ve been lurking around the forum for a while but I had to post a reply to this. MMS is dangerous (its basically bleach) and no one should be promoting it on this forum… Here is the link from the FDA: http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm220747.htm And here’s the text, in case that link doesn’t work: “FDA Warns Consumers of Serious Harm from Drinking Miracle Mineral Solution (MMS) Product contains industrial strength bleach The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to take Miracle Mineral Solution, an oral liquid also known as “Miracle Mineral Supplement” or “MMS.” The product, when used as directed, produces an industrial bleach that can cause serious harm to health. The FDA has received several reports of health injuries from consumers using this product, including severe nausea, vomiting, and life-threatening low blood pressure from dehydration. Consumers who have MMS should stop using it immediately and throw it away. MMS is distributed on Internet sites and online auctions by multiple independent distributors. Although the products share the MMS name, the look of the labeling may vary. The product instructs consumers to mix the 28 percent sodium chlorite solution with an acid such as citrus juice. This mixture produces chlorine dioxide, a potent bleach used for stripping textiles and industrial water treatment. High oral doses of this bleach, such as those recommended in the labeling, can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms of severe dehydration. MMS claims to treat multiple unrelated diseases, including HIV, hepatitis, the H1N1 flu virus, common colds, acne, cancer, and other conditions. The FDA is not aware of any research that MMS is effective in treating any of these conditions. MMS also poses a significant health risk to consumers who may choose to use this product for self-treatment instead of seeking FDA-approved treatments for these conditions. The FDA continues to investigate and may pursue civil or criminal enforcement actions as appropriate to protect the public from this potentially dangerous product. The FDA advises consumers who have experienced any negative side effects from MMS to consult a health care professional as soon as possible and to discard the product. Consumers and health care professionals should report adverse events to the FDA’s MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088 or online at http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.”"

3,Chris24,253,"Wow, I did not know this topic was gonna be about some FDA warning instead of me actually curing a chronic disease that had been with me for 8 years within 2 months!? I am not uninformed, I’m not stupid, and I have done my research. Guess I have to make a case. I hope you guys are open to my arguments and research. I am willing to listen if you are. Just for the record: I am not promoting MMS, and have no link to its production or sale. I’m just describing my experience with it. The FDA claims, yet they bring up no evidence to back up their claim. Claim #1: MMS is basically bleach.  Now look closely at what they are saying. They are saying that sodium chlorite, a water purification compound is bleach. Besides the obvious facts that bleach has different ingredients and requires a reducing agent, think about the following. Would you pour bleach on open wounds? Would you use bleach to purify our drinking water, to rinse our food? I think not. Yet this is exactly what has been going on for years. Why? Because acidified sodium chlorite is FDA approved to be used to clean our food and water, and is also used as an alternative to alcohol in wound disinfecting. “The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the food additive regulations to provide for the safe use of acidified solutions of sodium chlorite as an antimicrobial agent in processing water and ice intended for use in contact with seafood.” “The additive is used as an antimicrobial agent in water and ice that are used to rinse, wash, thaw, transport, or store seafood in accordance with current industry standards of good manufacturing practice. The additive is produced by mixing an aqueous solution of sodium chlorite with any GRAS acid to achieve a pH in the range of 2.5 to 2.9 and diluting this solution with water to achieve an actual use concentration of 40 to 50 parts per million (ppm) sodium chlorite. Any seafood that is intended to be consumed raw shall be subjected to a potable water rinse prior to consumption.” (1) 40 to 50 ppm! The amounts that are taken by people are 1 to 4 ppm. Acidified sodium chlorite aka chlorine dioxide has been tested to up to 300 ppm. A toxic chemical? Not really.  Table salt in high enough doses will kill you. But in small doses it is harmless. Same with sodium chlorite, exept, sodium chlorite hasnt killed anyone, not even when a 25 year old man tried to kill himself with an extreme overdose of 10 grams of pure sodium chlorite. That is hundreds of times the dose of MMS users, the difference being of course that MMS users first acidify the solution. The man fully recovered. (2) Claim #2:MMS is taken as an aqueous solution of 28% sodium chlorite  Not really. MMS is really 22.4% sodium chlorite which isn’t a big difference from their statement but it shows that they don’t know what they are talking about. But a dose of MMS is never 28% or even 22.4% sodium chlorite. It is 0.016% — 1750 times less potent than they would have you believe. (3) MMS users use a few drops in a glass, which they then fill with water. The actual concentration of sodium chlorite ingested is ridiculously small since most of the solution turns into the harmless chlorine dioxide. Claim #3: There is no way that MMS can differentiate between pathogens and beneficial bacteria There are obvious differences. First off, the pathogen generates poisons and the beneficial bacteria do not. Second, taken from Jim Humbles partial e-book: All organisms and body cells and even liquids have an ORP (oxidation Reduction Potential) that can be either positive or negative. The ORP is the electrical charge that cells exert on other things in their immeditate environment. Oxidizers also have an ORP, mostly called Oxidation Potential, and all oxidizers have a positive potential. Now an interesting point: – All pathogens (poison producers) have a negative ORP; and – All beneficial bacteria have a positive ORP. MMS is an oxidizer, therefore, it is positively charged and cant do anything with positively charged beneficial bacteria. Pathogens however are destroyed because their negative charge causes them to be oxidized. “What is ORP? Oxidation Reduction Potential. This is basically a measure of the molecular charge which gives the level of the ability of a substance to oxidize or reduce oxidation. A positive ORP charge indicates that the substance is an oxidizer. The higher the positive charge the stronger the oxidizing power. To oxidize involves the exchange of electrons between two atoms. The atom that gains the electron is said to be oxidized, which means that the chemical makeup is changed and it either dies, or in the case of our body cells the DNA is altered. A negative ORP indicates the ability to donate electrons, the higher the negative charge, the greater the ability to provide electrons. This is the level of the ability to be an antioxidant. Free radicals (chlorine dioxide is a free radical) are oxidizers and their ability to oxidize is eliminated or reduced by the addition of electrons from atoms with a negative ORP.” (4) The pathogens, which are negatively charged donates its electrons to the oxidizer (MMS) which is postively charged. The loss of its electrons kills the pathogen. Other reasons why I am sceptic of the FDA’s warning. Once you dig into the world of the pharmaceutical industry, you will find out that as with any other industry: money rules everything.(5) You dont have to read Lynne Mctaggert’s ‘What Doctors Dont Tell You’ or see Michael Moore’s Sicko in order to find that one out. Here are some issues to consider: Chlorine dioxide is known as the most powerful pathogen killer out there, and has been used for about a hundred years because of it. Then why is there no research going in to the medicinal use of chlorine dioxide to treat life threatening diseases? Simple: because for Big Pharma, there is no money in it. It can not be patented, and as is the case, the pharmaceutical industry is all about patenting.(5) If MMS actually destroys pathogens effectively, that would render countless of FDA approved drugs useless. A whole economy would fall! Of course the FDA tries to stop this. With lies. This is no conspiracy theory. Think about it. The FDA approves sodium chlorite to be used in large quantities in water purification and food, and at the same time bans it for medicinal purposes because it is toxic bleach? Makes sense? Cannabis oil has been proven to reduce cancer tumors, (6) yet, we all know about the USA’s futile war on drugs. Now, finally we see cannabis being used medicinally, in a controlled way. Why? There is money to be earned this way. There is an oncologist in Italy treating cancer succesfully with baking powder. Yes, no joke. (7) Sodium bicarbonate is used to treat tumors smaller than 3 cm in diameter, with significant results. The doctor lost his medical license. Why treat people with an effective cheap treatment (which again, can’t be patented) when you could treat them with super expensive damaging chemo or carcinogenic radiation therapy? FDA approved drugs kill thousands of people every year. This is a fact. And we worry about MMS? Fluconazole, an FDA approved drug, is known to at least cause damage to the liver. MMS is not known to cause any damage. Ever. And millions of people are using it worldwide. On the internet you will find hundreds of testimonies from people who have used MMS to cure countless of diseases. Don’t fall for scare tactics. Look for good arguments instead. “A quick google search” doesn’t cut it. If anyone has any good research indicating MMS is poison, I would really like to see it.

Yes you can get candida on a vegan diet just as easy as on a meat-based diet. However, the question I was asking myself was if an anti-candida vegan diet could do a better job at curing someone than a anti-candida diet with animal products. I also know people that are very happy vegans, however I dont believe it is good for everyone. I have read multiple books about the candida diet and in every one brown rice is allowed. I eat brown rice every other day. Oat and legumes is also allowed in the books. Ah thanks for the heads up! Appreciate it. But really, whole oats? You don’t mean gluten free or oat bran?"

10,Able900,253,"Thomas wrote: I find that the admin comes in extremely wired and stupid. Hi, Thomas.  The administration is acting in a manner which is the opposite of ‘wired and stupid.” In fact, they’re acting in a very responsible manner. Did you read the information on the link that Sophie posted leading to the report released by the FDA? The report is a direct warning against using “Miracle Mineral Solution” also known as MMS. The FDA, or the Food and Drug Administration of the United States, is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; a part of our government in other words, and it’s governed by US Federal laws and regulations. The job of the FDR is to protect the health of US citizens by assuring that foods are safe, sanitary and properly labeled; that drugs and vaccines and other biological products and medical devices intended for human use are safe and effective, and helping the public to obtain accurate, science-based information they need to safely use products, medicines, devices, and foods to improve their health. I’m just guessing, but I imagine the reason the administration asked Chris to cease posting his cure-Candida-with-MSM messages is due to the FDR’s research and science-based report concerning the product. Since the website refers to the FDA on their home page, I assume that the site is owned by a United States citizen, and any responsible business located in the United States would be wise enough to follow the FDA’s warnings and would respond in the same manner as this administration has.

0,nicolita,254,"Hello all! How serendipitous it is that I have stumbled across this community – I’m all at once sad to see so many people suffering with candida, and relieved that I’m not alone. I’ve been experiencing a wide range of emotions as I move through, step by step, my personal cleanse/detox process. From abject depression, to sheer joy. Mood swings, fatigue, brain fog, oh MY! Today I was in a coffee shop having a pot of chamomile tea and I sank into a deep despair watching a couple at another table share a giant chocolate chip cookie. In comparison to a lot of the stories I’ve read here so far, my symptoms seem relatively mild. However, for me they’re bad enough to make me more interested in never waking up again, than waking up one more day feeling like a zombie. I guess it probably all started about 3 years ago. I started getting super frequent vaginal infections. I was in an out of my gyn’s office so often, it was absurd. Nothing worked. I finally went to see my Ayurvedic Dr., and she put me on a strict no sugar diet. I half-assed it for a few weeks and then returned to my regular diet. The vaginal infections kind of went away on their own eventually, but I was left with what I would describe as a chronic low-grade yeast infection. Barely detectable or bothersome but present. Last February I started to feel like I was coming down with a cold, and well….it never went away. o-O Basically I wake up every day feeling like I either have the worst allergies ever or a raging case of sinusitis. My sinuses are inflamed, nasal passages clogged, sometimes I have a bit of a sore throat. It gets better as the day progresses, and then I usually fall into an afternoon slump. Coffee used to be the only thing that would get me through the day. I switched from coffee to green tea about a week and a half ago, which has felt really good, and I know it’s not ideal for the strict diet, but I need to move more gradually into it, or I get too overwhelmed. The diet I am following right now is kind of a blend of what I was advised by my Ayurvedic Dr. and what I’ve learned through my own research as well as a friend who’s a nutritionist and struggled with candida herself. In a nutshell – no gluten, no sugar (includes no fruit except for an occasional squeeze of lemon, no booze), no coffee, no starchy/sugary veggies. I am eating eggs, and salmon a couple times a week. Any other meat makes me absolutely nauseous. I ate an organic lamb burger the weekend before last and I almost had to call into work sick. Speaking of work, part of why I am doing the diet the way that I am is because my work requires me to be very active and social. For this reason and because of my issue with meat, I’ve kept two legumes in my diet that I digest well: chickpeas and red lentils. Other than that it’s tons of salads, quinoa, and steamed veggies, as well as tons of coconut oil of course. I feel like all I do is shop for food, cook, clean up, and work. I’ve been taking lots of hot baths….I’m currently taking a probiotic in the morning (megaflora 50 bill), vitamin C, b complex, and vitamin D (im deficient), milk thistle as well as a vibrant health green shake once a day. I’m about 3 weeks in and experience relief in some areas, but not others. The quality of sleep has vastly improved, but I still feel sluggish and stuffed up when I wake up in the morning. There have been a couple of mornings, though, where I woke feeling better. I can’t figure out why some days are better than others, but that’s where I’m at right now. I’ve also had random bursts of energy where I somehow suddenly feel free of all my symptoms, completely clear headed and light-hearted. As I write this I feel completely run down and my sinuses are throbbing. *sigh* Considering adding Triphala and Neem to my routine to keep my liver healthy during “die-off”, which I suppose is what’s happening right now. This kind of sucks. It’s so tempting every day to just go back to the cycle of a couple glasses of wine at night to sooth the physical and emotional pain, and then coffee in the morning to get the motor running…I can’t thrive like that though, which is why I find myself here. I want to thrive, not just survive. I hope that we will all eventually find relief through taking charge of our own health & well being. Blessings!"
1,nicolita,254,"ps – I forgot to include some of my other symptoms and improvements. symptoms – occasional vertigo clogged ears improvements – bm are regular and solid now. sometimes they even come several times a day, as opposed to once in the morning after coffee. yay! also i feel things are getting better and better down under every day. less itching and discharge. It’s difficult having a social life right now, but I kind of am enjoying taking lots of “me” time to rest and reflect and get healthy. it’s hard enough balancing THAT with my two jobs, so i’m going to keep taking it easy. thanks for letting me vent."
0,soon,255,"Hello everyone! It’s been about 4 months now and I am happy to say that I went through it all and I am now on the other side. I’m better! So don’t lose hope! It only seems like no one gets better because once they do they stop coming to the forum. It wasn’t easy though. I was bloated to hell. My body screamed for sugar. I became too weak to go to work. I thought I had an autoimmune disease. I fell into depression. So what helped? First of all, get some blood tests done. I personally was deficient in iron and vitamin D. Getting those deficiencies sorted out helped tremendously. Then what? Go for the cultured vegetables. I first saw real improvement when I started including cultured vegetables in my meals along with water kefir. The milk kefir messed with me. Go hypoallergenic. Meat. Vegetables. Don’t go too low carb. That’ll mess up your thyroid.Try squash or pumpkin. Heal your leaky gut with L-glutamine. Chew your food at least 30 times. Have patience. I went too hard with the anti-fungals for the first couple of months. I thought I could nuke the beast and be done with it. I don’t think that was a very good idea. It hurt to walk for a while. Know that gluten is implicated in no less than three auto-immune diseases. Avoid it like the plague. The most effective anti-fungals for me were garlic, pau d’arco and GSE. These kill parasites too. If you feel like shit afterwards give your body a day to flush out the toxins. Four months ago I couldn’t eat so much as a single carrot without having a terrible reaction. But now I can eat anything I want including all fruits and sweeteners. So keep it up! You will get better!"

Then as i get into the plan i started having groin itch and slight anal itch. When i finished the plan or maybe a week or so after, I start having the super duper extreme anal itch. How do i know if this is yeast or some type of parasite? Its waking me up every night around 3:00 and i cant go back to sleep for scratching. I have yellowy colored discharge and its literally driving me insane. I took some Pin-x thinking it may be pin worms but it hasn’t changed."

Although this certainly sounds like pinworms, especially considering the timing, it could possibly be a die-off symptom as well. If you want to continue the treatment for pinworms, since you’ve already tried Pin-X, you might try using Reese’s Pinworm Medicine for your whole family, and then do a complete parasite cleanse for yourself. After the Reeses treatment, you can order Humaworm for everyone in the family to take to remove any pinworms left and other types of parasites as well. You should also do a complete cleaning of your house; pinworm eggs can end up just about any place and they live for about three weeks. You want to specifically keep your bedding changed with clean sheets every few days for a while. Able"
3,raster,256,"Itchiness is a typical die-off symptom. One thing you could do is get tested for parasites; genova diagnostics has stool tests where you can determine the levels of the parasites you have. The bleeding sounds awfully like hemorrhoids which is due to constipation. I went ahead and took black walnut extract after being on the candida diet for about 9 months and experienced considerable die-off; I knew this was the parasites dying in my body. In my opinion, anyone who has candida likely has some kind of other flora or parasite imbalance as well because these thrive in the same environment. I was really itchy when I lived in an apartment filled with mold. -raster"
4,Ronnie,256,Thanks for the replys. They’ve been really helpful. I went ahead and ordered the humaworm and Mcombs had actually recommended i do a parasite cleanse at the end of the plan anyway so im gonna try it. I will keep you posted with the results.

0,natmike5464,257,"Hi there, I just feel as though I might feel a bit better by writing my story. I just feel like all of us must have something in common, or in our genes/lives that have caused this. My male cousin has the same issues as me! Some folks eat and drink all they want and don’t get this…WHY??? I am female,I am was born about a month premature in 1970 at 5 lbs 8 oz-so I am 42 years old and come from parents who smoked alot also drank often.My mother did not breast feed. She says that I was sick since the day I was born. I had severe colic and would not stop crying.. she had so much of a hard time, she was lucky to have a big family to get help to care for me.She took me from doctor to doctor but there was no help. So I was fed milk which I was allergic/sensitive to. I remember I was a very hyper child–  I also constantly had sore ears and throat, and had my tonsils removed. So I also took many antibiotics in my childhood. I was a smoker since 15 Yrs old and quit now 2 yeas ago at 40 in 2010 cause it caused instant dizzyness & nausea. SO next I remember that around 12 yrs old, I would get these severe stomach cramps, and would be on the toilet for hours, soaked & wet from head to toe from the pain.. I would rock back & forth holding my stomach for hours- my mother would bring my some hot coffee with a shot of brandy, and sometimes take me to the hospital where they would give me a needle in the butt. After being on the toilet for hours, FINALLY…. I would have an explosion of diarrea.. OHHH WOWWWWW what a relief!! the pain was gone. Finally I was diagnosed with Lactose intolerance & this is when I became aware that diet has something to do with these cramps. SO now I am about 15 and my hormones are totally out of wack- I had very bad periods and very painful cramps…My emotions were all over the place.. I hear about being rebellious but I am sure that I took it to another level that I don’t even want to talk about… So after about one and a half years,I quit high school and moved away as my parents could not handle me anymore! And I don’t blame them one bit.. I was a very angry, jealous,very sensitive person- I must say that all I did was put bad things in my body! all I ate was Pizza & cheez whiz on toast, or pasta with cheez, or BBQ sauce. Even though the pizza made me feel horrible I needed it. I went to see a doctor as PMS was just off the charts, I could not handle myself.. I hated the world..I was about 18 when he prescribed Lorazepam, and I am still taking this today- which makes about 24 years now! I take 2 per day… and keep wondering if this makes candida worst? or even if it helped to give me this horrible thing it is.. So a year later, there was a big change in my job and I changed locations and the job that I was doing.. I was working in a call centre environment. I was enjoying this new job, but it was stressful. However, this is when & where I started to get very sick. I had developped sensitivites to scents. Today,I am really extremely sensitive. And when I am around it, my lungs hurt to breathe,I cannot concentrate no matter how hard I try, I get nausea, dizzy, sore muscles/joints,and the worst headaches. I also have many food allergies/ Chemical sensitivity/ TMJ/ IBS/FIBRO/ Acne/rash on neck that never ever goes away/ and continuous yeast issues.. SEVERE concentration/forgetful problems.  At 41, I got the shingles, I believe this stems from all this garbage of perfumes/stress/candida So they agreed to sit me by myself for a few months, and things went very well as I was not exposed to chemicals, however, they brought me back as per their story, ” if something happens no one would find me” which is untrue as there was still at least 4 people that went by there 3 times a day. Anyhow, here I am now back on the floor with about 80 other people. I have been doing the Naet treatments since April of 2012 and this is helping, just not as fast as I was hoping.  I am now doing a candida diet ONCE AGAIN, and cannot take this die off– My doctor told me that I have a sensitive brain.. is this even possible? that means I am sensitive to everyhting? Anyhow, the way I see it, it goes like this: Candida is like a roller coaster nightmare-  “you feel like crap, you diet.. Ya go through hell, then feel better & falloff the wagon for a few months, and feel like crap and diet again…. This has got to be hard on the system!! It’s been 2 weeks now and for the 1st time, I have ordered molybdenum which I hope it hasn’t been too hyped up, cause I am really looking forward to staying on this stupid diet but without the negative effects, as I cannot funtion or go to work while I go through this stupid yeast side effects.I have tried everything in this forum- and die off is just too hard for my body.My worst candida symptoms are: severe food cravings, no concentration, constant mucus from everywhere , sinus pain , constipation/IBS, very weak upper body, sore scalp, bad breath, rashes & itchiness, no sexual drive at all/ bloating/drained and tired/ neck pain, an d I can go on & on…. The only thing I have not tried is baking soda with water and coffee enemas.. I would love to hear if any of you have tried this… If anyone has similar background/ issues maybe we should have a place in this forum where we can all enter characteristics that we think has started our candida. Exapmle: pre-mature, cousin has it too/ ear aches/ antibiotics/ allergies/ smoker/ ect… If everyone would do this,we would see the most repetitions & this would be a great tool to be able to compare notes, and hopefully come to some sort of conclusion. Well I hope you all get off this roller coaster ride and get healthier! All the Best."

I am eating cabbage, salads, beets, whole chicken, grounded turkey,fish… garlic, cilantro, Daiya cheese,LIVE organic raw garden vegetables crackers/ Farm Boy fresh Salsa, Farm Boy homemade lentil soup, Farm Boy organic oatmeal cookies ( only when I really need it), Lotsa veggies & greens, quinoa rarely,yeast free rye bread maybe every 2 days, avocados,radishes. ~every day I take 1 big teaspoon of grounded flax with a small amount of chlorella powder, Milk Thistle after every meal, 1 teaspoon Apple cider, and 1 capylic acid capsule that I will not take right now cause I think its giving me die off.. Vitamin B complex, vitamin D, Magnesium & 3000 mg of Vitamin C. I have just started to oil pull and think its helping… My plan of action is once I get the moly, I will take it 3 days then do the cleanse, then the diet?

0,HappenNow,258,"Hi Everyone. Looking to gain a little support. I just started a *true* candida cleanse yesterday (I was eating a lot of nuts and seeds before which I don’t think I do well with) after going to a few colon hydrotherapy treatments where TONS of yeast came out. I’ve always been what i thought to be a healthy eater focusing on fruits and veggies, a love of vinagre and fermented foods (yeast central!) but no processed foods really to speak of. I’ve always been a calorie counter and exercise nut but despite this have packed on 10 pounds in the last few months (and was alerted to adrenal fatigue, sluggish thyroid, lymphatic congestion and HIGH cortisol levels — which I’m guessing is because of the candida). The eat less exercise more equation doesn’t seem to be adding up to weight loss for me. I really want to lose this weight but I have NO energy at all. I don’t know if it’s better to rest or push through. I force myself to go for walks, yoga and bike rides but am usually exhausted ALL of the time (when I used to just drink a coffee and head to the gym for an hour no problem). I don’t know if i should wait or just keep pushing. Do you think I’ll be able to lose fat and keep some of my muscle through this process? I barely want to see anyone right now with the way I look and I feel really bummed out (eating out is a challenge and drinking is off limits so I feel alienated from my super social circle). Any advice on how to get the energy levels up? Any experience with weight loss with minimal exercise? I’m really frustrated and don’t know what to do. I’m hoping to get some light at the end of the tunnel! love, HN"

If you supplement your deficiencies with plenty of vitamins and nutrients, you should be giving your body what it needs. I also would not push yourself by doing too much exercise; the single most important thing you need to get better is plenty of rest and sleep. I would limit yourself to long walks only and not push yourself any more than that. As you start killing the yeast your body should start losing some weight in general. Keep in mind our body is like 80%+ water. Your energy reserve levels take a long time to recover; for me it took about a year. Hope this helps. -raster"
2,Ariel Andersen,258,"This is my first post and feel the pain of newbie HN. I cut wheat out of my already limited diet (no dairy, soy, egg, oatmeal, chocolate) and feel like I’ve given up so much already I don’t know if I can do the complete no yeast diet. But I’ve known for years that yeast is my problem and I’m 54 and feel bad much of the time and don’t want to go into old age without ever having felt great for more than a few weeks at a time. Keep trying HN! Please give me any advice you experienced no-yeasters have to give to us new overwhelmed members. Thanks and I’m glad I’ve found you all!"
3,HappenNow,258,"Hi Raster — Thanks for the reply. I’m juicing green veggies and eating a TON of them it seems. The green veg is the base of my diet now. As well as trying to incorporate coconut oil, maybe a couple of tablespoons of coconut flour to make zucchini pancakes in the morning (yeast, dairy and sugar free of course) and a couple servings of chicken or turkey breast as well as a sprinkling of fresh lemon juice, garlic, and onions. I take a bunch of vitamins and supplements too but I am ZONKED. I barely want to leave the house so hopefully the yeast dies off in the next couple of weeks so I can maintain some of my relationships! I do do long walks (and yoga… I’m a teacher) so good to know I’m on the right track there at least. I do miss busting it out at the gym and worry sometimes that the fat won’t come off unless I’m there 5x a week (I think I’ve been brainwashed!) but I’d rather get the underlying causes sorted out than overdo it. you’re right. Ariel — You can do it! I know you can! you just need to find some alternatives if you’re having a hard time giving up the carbs. I never ate much carbohydrate to begin with except fruit and beans but honestly I NEED to get rid of this problem and seeing the yeast come out was such an eye opener. Is it safe for you to get colon hydrotherapy? That’s what I did and I saw a whole colony that lived in my gut. That was enough for me and I felt a lot better after 2 treatments (even if only for a few days) Have you looking at the coconut bread recipe? That with a teeny bit of some coconut butter is completely delicious say most people on the forum. I’m just telling people I have an intestinal infection now to try and deal with the social awkwardness of ordering at the restaurant and feeling generally like a social outcast… so much of our culture revolves around sharing meals and most of the time I’m embarrassed."
4,raster,258,"Another thing you could do as an alternative to exercise is sweating out the toxins via the skin…by doing a hot tub, jacuzzi, steam room, sauna, etc. This will detox the body from the yeast reducing die-off, and it can help with weight loss as well. Plan on a 6-18 month recovery period to get over candida; consider it on par with other major diseases such as MONO, strep, HIV, cancer, etc. except the recovery time is faster. -raster"
5,Ms T,258,"Hi, HN. YES!! I think you can definitely lose fat and gain muscle during this process. However, it takes time, and you may need to allow yourself a rest period while your body goes through the major part of the die-off. (If you go the anti-fungal route, make sure to start with the chelated Molybdenum for a few days prior. Major mistake I made was not doing this.) I train physcially in some form almost daily — whether it’s for strength, speed, metabolic resistance, or flexibility. I am also a certified kettlebell instructor, and although it’s not my primary source of income, it is something I am passionate about. And I lift fairly heavy for a female. I hit a wall where all my training was reaching a point of diminishing returns. I just wasn’t getting any stronger or faster. Any good coach will tell you that nearly every athlete hits this point at some time or another. It may be due to some of the factors you mentioned — adrenal fatigue, elevated cortisol, or any number of others. What do you at that point? You de-load, that is, you take it easy, and/or you try something else. Give yourself permission to take it easy. Sounds cliche but listen to what your body is telling you. I’ve only been on the anti-Candida diet and anti-fungals for six weeks, but I took a respite from training during the first 2 to 3 weeks because my die off was so severe. I couldn’t sleep, my entire body ached. When I resumed training, I felt this odd mix of being slightly weaker, but knowing that my body was somehow functioning better and I had the ability to get even stronger than I was before. Prior to starting this process (diet and anti-fungals), I was never really fat because of my activity level, I did eat better than the average American, but my sugar cravings were off the charts. I think my cortisol levels had also been elevated for some time. And I think a major source of the Candida for me is that for several years I lived in a house filled with mold (ugh). It’s much too early for me to say that I am “cured,” but I already feel much better, so much stronger, and so much more capable of taking my body to a new level of athletic performance. I have dropped almost 15 lbs effortlessly, I am gaining muscle, and I am moving better than ever before. And I enjoy the process of thinking about how what I put into my mouth is nourishing my body (or not). So… YES…my answer to you is YES, you can lose fat and gain muscle, and you may have to take a step back to get there. I hope this helps. T"
6,HappenNow,258,"Thanks for this Ms T. For the past 2 months I’ve had a REALLY hard time getting to the gym consistently — it seems that whenever I go I get sick after or extremely tired (when I used to down a cup of coffee and go for an hour 6 days a week) and feel relatively great. I’ve put on some weight and I’m just desperate to look like myself again (even though I’d still be considered “normal” weight) , do the sports I loved doing, and having some energy. Definitely understand the “wall” that you’re talking about. My legs just ache. I guess in the meantime i’ll just keep eating my green veg with coconut oil and chicken, walking and doing yoga as much as my body allows and try not to get too down on myself about it. i just want to know that this will turn around and I’ll get my body back. If you have any tips on workouts that are appropriate or ways to get a little energy I’d love to hear about it!"
0,mojosmuze,259,"Well….I am not sure how to start. I have known for a while that I have a candida infection. I have been on over 163 medications in 4 years (all were stopped 2 years ago). I was mistakenly diagnosed with Cancer, Endometriosis and treated with injectable chemo right after taking luprolide LAR for hormonal imbalances and supposed PCOS. It turns out I never had cancer (and they never fully tested for it as well) .They now say it is Fibromyalgia and I MYSELF found out 2 years ago that a lot of it was food allergies from this Candida. I am now fighting this fight again, and I refuse to take any medication as my gallbladder is gone and my liver simply can’t even tolerate a little bit of lemon to say the least. I know that this is a Candida and I am getting tested for hypothyroidism. I am hoping it isn’t getting worse, but it seems to be pointing this way. I lately have been going through some related anxiety and stress which never helps. I have started guided imagery and relaxation/meditation techniques, drink lots of water, and journaling on a daily basis. But I am seeing that this is getting super hard to overcome if not impossible at this time. While on Chemotherapy, they took out my gallbladder and ever since this surgery (2 years ago) I have had this problem (I have also had 5 surgeries in the last 5 years). The hardest part is that DOCTORS THINK I AM LYING TO GET MEDICATION!! They do not believe me and I am allergic to most all medications, herbs, and foods. I have been very bad premenstrual cramping, nausea, adrenal fatigue, brain fog, tingling in my legs, pain in my legs like never before, thrush of course, sore neck and beck, headaches, and am tired as soon as I wake up, perhaps a vitamin/mineral deficiency, skeletal pains, horrible ovulation, sensitivity to most foods, new depression that was never there, dry throat and mouth, new allergies, my toes are always frozen. I can’t handle milk thistle or any of these liver detox medications. I have horrible reactions. Hot-Cold intolerance, inability to digest paul d’orco and any kind of teas. I have not had this to this degree before. I am not sure where to turn to and I find myself feeling so alone, being as NO ONE will help me to find a diet or protocol that I can work with. I am allergic to many foods (that I contribute to the Candida infection) and was told to eat RAW and steamed veggies a lot. I don’t see it completely helping, but I am a very big fan of coconut oil, EVO oil, and garlic, and onions. I would really like to rid myself of this once and for all as I am consistently tired, anxious, hungry, unable to digest properly, headaches, sinus problems, new chest and neck nerve pains, and slow lymph node reaction and all the rest listed above….(?!) I also recently found out that my Dentist had lied to me and placed a metal plated porcelain crown in my mouth. I specifically asked not to get this, and now I am being hounded by debt collectors and am unable to pay this because I can’t hold down a job. I had testing done at a local naturopath office ( I like them but they are somewhat complacent with my care and do not understand Candida as well as I would have hoped). I have lost out on MANY jobs, schooling, money, life experiences, health, sound piece of mind, and family events. I am hardly able to exercise as I know get winded fairly easily and am so tired. I sometimes feel like I can feel my heartbeat in my leg….. I don’t know where else to turn to. As I said, it is BEYOND desperation at this point. All of my relationships are suffering. I have tried MANY Candida diets and books, but because I am so sensitive to MOST HERBS, some minerals, some vitamins, foods (corn, eggs, wheat, amaranth, sugar, asparagus, maybe rice and all other carbs NOW, dairy- besides raw cheese, caffeine, coffee, all fructose/sucrose, some fruits, and almost if not all chemicals, outdoor allergies, some indoor allergies, fungi, as well as parabens, SLS phalates, BPA (which I do not use!!!). My body feels as if it cannot rebound. I am so desperate for a healthy life. I have changed my diet completely 2 years ago. I eat 95-99%% Organic (“Natural” if I have to meaning no preservatives, colors, flavors, but make sure if they are really non GMO), I don’t eat Gluten or any of my allergies above. I try to avoid all carbs and this doesn’t seem to have too big of an effect. I use non GMO shampoo and conditioner, I don’t use perfume but essential oils, and I am trying to use the knowledge I DO have to keep this at bay. But this time it has really gotten out of control. I don’t necessarily have constipation, but I do only go usually once a day and it is diarrhea (embarrassing but I feel I need to share this). I would love to find a healthy program that can really change my life. My symptoms don’t even seem to be letting up very much this time. I am planning to follow your tips for this and cook up my veggies, but like I said—I am so sensitive that I can’t even eat half of the food that are on the list. I apologize for such a long letter but I am BEYOND desperate for some help. At this point, we are broke and I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. I know it will be a lot of work, and I am willing to do it. But I do not have the money to be spending on Dr’s appointments, being that I am consistently fighting this fight. I am way in debt from this. We have no money and are looking at either going into a shelter or moving home (which is really not an option at this point). I try not to stress or cry but it is REALLY HARD when I am sick day in and day out. I have recently tried to start a new job, and it is not working out very well being that I can barely move at times. I haven’t been able to do any of the recommended cleansings as my liver is so overburdened that it can barely process anything anymore (and having no gallbladder doesn’t help my liver in detoxifying). I BEYOND appreciate taking time out of your busy schedules to even pay attention to this. NO DOCTOR LISTENS TO ME. They say it is all in my head. It has been 6 years, 100+ doctors, hundreds of Medications, multiple hospitals, multiple infections, and still no answers. I have sent my story to multiple people and they will simply not answer, ignore me, or tell me to go someplace else. It is not only embarrassing, but hurtful. I WILL NOT do medications in any form. I am so sensitive to anything that I feel this horrible sense of sadness. I don’t know whether I will get my life back. I would like to think so, but I have tried EVERYTHING and it just doesn’t seem to help. I am starting with a new Chiropractor. I am also continuing my healing therapy. Again, THANK YOU SO MUCH for listening to my story. No one has and all I really desperately want is to live an honest and successful life so that I can help improve the life of so many others. I desire to help people in my position, but in order to do so I need make a positive journey in the right direction. I am not trying to sound rude or needy, but my life has been so impaired that at this point I have nowhere to turn. I see the forums, but I am so sensitive to all of this stuff that I have no idea what the heck to do. Blessings and Thanks Everyone, Beryl  North Dakota, USA"
1,godwill,259,"First of all, I totally feel for you! And just so you know, you are on my prayer list Beryl! I am a believer in the supernatural, and at this point, you need the God of heaven and earth to intervene in your life. On another note, I have some very weird suggestions that I have come across in my own journey to healing (I am blessed to be catching this earlier in life and before lots of doctor intervention.) First of all, I am on Day 5 of treating my condition with bee propolis that I grind myself. It put me through terrible die-off immediately, which means I know it works. I’m not sure if that would work for you or not, but it’s one of those treatments no one really talks about (so I’m in the dark as well!) Since you have such bad liver function it might be just as hard as all the other herbs/treatments you’ve tried, but its good to keep in your toolbox of possible treatments. Secondly, DIET: I make my own Kefir and kombucha. Look these things up. I believe in them. Also, look up the book Nourishing traditions. A lot of your food ideas are found in there. This comes down to food philosophy, and there are a TON of them out there, but seriously, I feel this book hits it best. The rule of thumb is: If your great great grandmother wouldn’t recognize it as food or know how to cook it, don’t eat it! Lastly, I have read some amazing testimonials about one very weird treatment: drinking your own urine. I am not nearly desperate enough to try this, but I can imagine I could be daring enough if need be! It’s very weird and anti-western thinking, but worth a shot… and hey, its FREE!! I’ll be praying for you! May God bless you on this journey and keep you safe and protected in your times of financial, emotional and physical struggles!"
2,SRQ,259,"Beryl, I too have been in chronic pain for many years and was misdiagnosed a multitude of times. Currently, I can only eat about a dozen foods. That’s it. Eradicating a candida overgrowth, from what I’m told, takes a long time. One year to 18-months. So, hang in there! Probably the best thing you can do immediately is to start taking a probiotic. There’s really good information on the forum about why it’s needed, suggested kinds and when to take it. Just do a search and you’ll find the info. Also, stick strictly to your diet of fresh vegetables and eggs (if you can tolerate them). Finally, you should include an antifungal in your diet. Coconut oil is considered to be the best; however, it may be cost prohibitive considering your budget. Another good option, which works for me, is garlic. Chop it up (introduce it slowly into diet) and put it on your veggies. If you feel odd afterward, that’s the effects of die-off, which means the antifungal is working. Include those three recommendations into your daily regimen. The candida diet is not an easy path but there are plenty of people here on the forum who can guide you and offer advice based on their personal experiences. Good luck and best wishes!"
3,raster,259,"Hello mojo, It sounds like you have a chronic toxicity problem in my opinion and your body is too taxed with too many toxins (from candida, parasites, mercury, plastics, chemicals, etc.) A great way to reduce the toxic load on the body is to sweat out the toxins via a steam room, sauna, hot tub, jacuzzi, or even hot bath. Its also a great way get minerals and nutrients in the body (the body absorbs the water). The skin is the bodies largest organ. I have a post about it: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst4116_The-benefits-of-sweating-out-toxins-mineral-water-and-minerals.aspx I would try to slowly increase the amount of coconut oil you ingest slowly if you can tolerate it. I would consider trying out SF722 if/when you can afford it. You may be able to cope with this better than other antifungals. It also sounds like you potentially have a thyroid issue/imbalance and I would try to get some iodine into the body (kelp, supplements, etc). Min-tran is one I use. I’d also try to chew your food more, which is a free thing to do: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1222_Chew-your-food-longer–Simple-tip-to-improve-your-health.aspx Acupuncture is also something that can greatly help your woes. It can heal specific organs and rebalance the body. Even one session could totally change how you feel. Its also great for detoxing the body and changing your mindset. It might reduce the load on your body and get your liver working again. -raster"

5,julsey414,259,"Beryl Do you have (however limited) a list of foods you CAN digest properly? I would suggest working on fairly liquid diet, at least for a week or two to see if that helps. Make yourself some homemade bone broths (link to recipe) This will give you a good base. steamed veggies will be easier to digest than raw, so start there, and add others as you go. Use the homemade broth as a base for a simple soup. Broccoli – saute onion, garlic, carrot,until soft. 16oz broth and bring to a boil. toss in broccoli and cook for a minute or two. put the whole thing in the blender until smooth. You can do this with spinach, kale, and any other variety of veggies and herbs. Adding a bit of ginger is helpful as well. Other healing plants are things such as burdock and nettles. If you can find fresh burdock, its root with a brown outer coating (dont peel, just scrub) and adding it, cooking can be very nourishing."
0,mm28,260,"Hello! I am so happy to have found this site and to have realized that I am definitely not alone in this battle. Ten years ago, when I was pregnant with my oldest child, I began to develop tinea versicolor. At the time I was told it was probably something I had gotten from someone else. I was told I might have gotten it from trying on clothes that someone else had tried on with tinea versicolor, or used the same towel as someone with tinea versacolor. I was given some cream (can’t think of the name now) and I was told to use it if there was an outbreak. Well for 10 years I have had the same outbreak with no lapse. Sometimes it has covered me from neck to rear, front and back, and at other times it has only been under my breasts. Nevertheless, it has always been present for the last 10 years. When my middle child was diagnosed with autism I was introduced into the world of yeast infections and failed to realize that the tinea versicolor may be related to candida. When my oldest and then youngest children were also diagnosed with autism, I began to wonder if this tinea versicolor was a gigantic sign that I had somehow given a yeast issue to my own children. They all have yeast issues with varying symptoms… none of them have tinea versicolor. I am now at the point where I am beating my head against the wall. I feel I have taken the necessary steps to try and get rid of this stuff but nothing has worked. My entire family has a yeast issue it seems and I really don’t know what supplements or what avenue to take next. We are a holistic family (no medications) and only eat organic and grass-fed beef/chicken/pork. I went to candidamd.com and saw the package he was suggesting, but it is $1000 to treat my family. I was wondering if anyone else has tried this, or if there is another way. I realize that supplements are expensive and I may pay that either way by the end of this treatment, but I want to make sure I do EXACTLY the right thing this time. My son can’t focus in school and is severely constipated, my daughter’s autism characteristics have returned full force and she is severely constipated, my youngest son asks for nothing but cheese, pickles, ice cream, and cookies, (which he does not get except for the occasional cheese slice) and I am covered from head to toe in this wicked rash that itches like crazy and makes me look like I am dying! Not to mention the fact that I am crabby and tired all the time. I suppose I could search this website a little more thoroughly and get the answers to all my questions, but I just needed to vent. I feel like my life has been absorbed by candida. I’m surrounded by it!!! I just need a break from this. I cannot live like this for another 10 years and I would definitely appreciate all the help I can get from anyone who has suffered also! In the meantime, I’m going to do some more perusing of the site, and hopefully get a little more educated. Thank you in advance, Michele"

2,Lauren,260,"Hi Michele!! Have you thought of doing probiotics for your children? From what I hear they seem to help a lot. I just read a section in The Road to Perfect Health by Brenda Watson about Autism. She suggest at least a 50 billion count of probotics, but also to find a doctor to monitor improvements. Many people on Brenda website have said how much their children with autism have approved on probiotics. Omega and vitamin D3 might also be helpful for the brain and leaky gut. How about fiber for your children to help with constipation? Also aloe vera juice is a very easy supplement that helps with making bowel movement regular and helps with constipation. I am not sure if aloe vera juice is safe for children though. This is just some information that I got from Brenda’s book or my own life, obviously a doctor would be best to consult on any of these suggestions. Great job with keeping your children on a diet. It hard because they crave the sweets but it is best for them. When I was working with autistic children I could see a big difference when they were on a diet. You are in my thoughts!!! 😀  Hope this helps Lauren"
3,ferngirl,260,"Mercury Toxicity!!!! This is a huge culprit for candida and many other symptoms. I have read on here that one should wait to have fillings removed until they expire so insurance will pay. My dentist told me yesterday that insurance regularly pays for filling replacement without question; and even if they don’t, this could be the 1st relief the body has in trying to detox and balance itself. Very hard to accomplish detox and healing with a continuous vapor release from amalgam fillings. I am surprised this site doesn’t have more about this, it is mentioned here and there but not as a first line of defense. Fillings must come out, and safely. There is much info for safe removal available on line.

0,Cally,261,"I have started taking oil of oregano over the past week or so, but I have heard mixed views about rotating antifungals. The last thing I want is for the candida to become immune to oil of oregano as I had a stool analysis done and it showed that this was the most beneficial in fighting candida for me. I am finding it difficult to obtain the other antifungals from my local health store and wondered whether I could stop taking oil of oregano after two weeks and have a two week break just taking coconut oil, or do I really need to take another antifungal such as red thyme oil. Apparently capryllic is not as effective for me according to my stool test so I am unsure what to do. If anyone could offer some advice it would be greatly appreciated as I am fast approaching two weeks on oil of oregano! Cally"
1,raster,261,"I don’t know where you read that you should take oil of oregano for only 2 weeks, but you can take it as much as you want. I personally would limit its use to about 6-8 weeks if you are looking for maximum benefit. I’ve been taking black walnut extract for the last 6 months or so and I am still taking it because it is still effective and its not for candida only, but parasites as well. Only stop taking things if they seem to be no longer effective. Caprylic acid is the only one that I know about that candida adapts to the easiest. -raster"

6,Able900,261,"After much studying as well as a lot of experience with the influence of various antifungals on the final outcome of a Candida albicans infestation, I can confidently say that the infestation can be cured by using just two antifungals, “providing” the two you use are coconut oil and oregano oil and also providing you can afford to purchase commercial probiotics as well as kefir grains and use both of these on a regular basis when the time comes to do so. In fact, if someone told me that they could afford to purchase only three different supplements during their entire treatment, I would suggest that they purchase coconut oil, commercial probiotic capsules, and kefir grains. The fact is, antifungals do not have the ability of curing a Candida infestation, but together, the three supplements I named can. As far as the Candida adapting to oregano oil is concerned, I have never found solid research showing that the Candida can or cannot adapt to oregano oil, but through my own experience, my assumption is that they cannot. However, it will not make a difference in your progress if you take the oil of oregano for two weeks straight and then stop it for 5 days before starting it again. I would continue taking the coconut oil on a daily basis as the Candida cannot adapt to it. Certain foods can also act as very strong antifungals; two of the most powerful foods for this purpose are rutabaga and Brussels sprouts. Be careful if you eat one of these for the first time as they are capable of causing die-off symptoms. Able"

I hope having this will make me accountable and also may help someone with a similiar story. I am 26 years old and I had a sweet tooth since I was a little girl. My symptoms started getting bad about 3 years ago after I moved to Seattle. I think the damp and stress of the city tore down any immunity I had left. I became sick to the point that I quit my job, broke up with my boyfriend, and moved back in with my parents. I intended to cleanse and build back up my health while home. At this point I am sicker than ever and I have had one unsuccessful attempt at moving out and reclaiming my life. Due to family dynamics I am going to move back out this week, which will entail a drive cross country. I am going to be living with an uncle and my cousin. I have not been working for nearly a year and my budget will be a huge concern. I am worried about not being able to purchase the cleanses and kits, but here is what I am going to do: -Abstain from all white foods, aside from fish/poultry.  -Supplement with coconut oil, olive oil and diatomaceous earth (all supplements I own currently) -Take probiotics by yogurt (I can’t afford capsules currently) -Eat as much greens as possible I suppose that’s all for now; wish me luck =) If anyone has any tips I would be glad to hear them 😉"
1,Belganson,262,"I think the kefir will be better for you than yogurt, although both is great.

I believe there are recipes on here for both. You can also be more assured that your kefir has cultures as opposed to pills. Good luck."
2,Oh Me,262,"Belganson-Thank you for the suggestion; I am going to be leaving in a few days so I’m not sure if I will be picking up any from the store now, but making my own kefir and yogurt are future goals of mine! While searching for a simple and inexpensive cleanse last night I found the sea salt flush. I mixed 1 tsp sea salt with 1 liter of warm water. Nothing happened, except I needed to pee like mad! lol I wonder if the solution wasn’t strong enough? After an uneventful flush, I took 2 tbs coconut oil in tea. That certainly caused a reaction. I was up most the night with pain, nausea, and cramping. My abdomen is distended and I uploaded pictures. This is my first time doing so online and I hope they work 🙂 I am a slim woman and my abdomen usually doesn’t go maybe a inch over my hip bones. I’ve been drinking fluids all day and will take some olive oil in a bit which will hopefully help. Good luck everyone! http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/195/dsc00355rm.jpg/ http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/696/dsc00354ni.jpg/"
3,Oh Me,262,"I feel awful. I got through a day and half and then had a major binge. I had so much thrush in my throat last night I could barely swallow. I even took two Benadryl because I was having trouble breathing and I was worried my throat was going to close up. I think the stress of moving this week is getting to me, but I also feel like breaking the plan is easier now. In the past I could manage to stick to the diet for several months at a time and now it’s almost like because I have failed so much it’s more likely to happen again. I think my body is also more attached to the yeast now. I feel physically ill without sugar and carbs, but then when I give in it’s in amounts I previously never would have indulged in. I shock myself at how much sugar/carbs I can eat in a day and it sometimes gets to the point that I’m sick and it all just comes back up. This morning I’ve just been trying to pull things back together. I’ve been doing a lot of research on the alkaline diet and I’m going to try that. I’ve been a vegan for several years before and also a raw food vegan for a period. I didn’t experience the health and wellbeing I hoped for, so I’m going to try and aim for 80% alkaline and 20% lean meats, fish, and acidic items. I know fruit is a problem with the candida however I don’t feel like my body is strong enough to handle a lot of detox right now. My first priority is to get my eating under control and the candida to a more manageable level. After that I will be able to implement some more drastic changes that will hopefully enforce some greater die off. But, right now I’m going to go treat myself to an epsom salt bath and enjoy the veggies I stocked the fridge. I hope you all are doing well 🙂 Keep at it despite the set backs!!"
4,raster,262,"Here’s a cheap and easy cleanse you can do if you are interested: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst997_Proper-and-Safe-Cleanse.aspx Keep in mind the cleanse won’t kill very much of the candida and its completely optional; it only sets your body’s environment a little bit before you start to recover. I would do some kind of transition diet where you transition into a strict anti-candida diet. Keep in mind you won’t get a cure unless you take probiotics; its the single most important thing you need to get better. The diet alone won’t cure you, you need supplements (vitamins, probiotics, antifungals and more) as well. A great way to get the body functioning a little bit better is to do acupuncture which will heal specific organs and help detox the body. You need to get the toxins out of your body as much as possible and sweating out the toxins naturally (steam room, sauna, hot tub, jacuzzi) is one of the best ways to reduce die-off. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590 http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590 http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst4116_The-benefits-of-sweating-out-toxins-mineral-water-and-minerals.aspx -raster"
5,jo2212,262,"Oh Me, try looking into some new recipes for the diet, some of them can be quite cost effective and might make you look at the diet in a different way thinking about feeding your body the good stuff rather than denying yourself the bad. I know this diet is hard, especially on a budget but coconut oil is a strong antifungal and including things like garlic and kefir into your diet could make a big difference. Also online is a great place to look for good deals on supplements when you can afford them. Jo"
6,Oh Me,262,"Things have been a complete turn since my last post. I decided to postpone leaving for a week so I could focus wholly on my health. I can’t believe how sick I’ve been these past few weeks and a cross country road trip was just unimaginable. Since my binge, my diet greatly improved but has not been 100% (WARNING: please don’t read below if you will be tempted; I would absolutely hate to be encouraging anyone to fall off a more stringent routine) I’ve been indulging in a small amount of dark chocolate almonds. I also have a piece of toasted sprouted grain bread or sprouted English muffin which has helped the transition tremendously. In particular, it’s helped me completely laid off the white bread and pastry items I was craving and caving into so often. I have incorporated a great deal more vegetables and greens into my diet. Organic goat’s milk kefir and yogurt are also enjoyable; the kefir is quite sour so I mix it into a green smoothie (kale or romaine) or have it with my sprouted grain item. I hate taking the coconut oil and find stark fat difficult to ingest. But, my breathing has improved greatly and I would say the buildup in my throat has decreased by about 50%. The cramping and pain after ingesting the oil still continues lasting only for about 2 hours so it’s worth dealing with. Any effects of the diet are so small compared to the pain and illness I was experiencing. Before beginning this I had a fever, extremely bad headaches and joint pain. My knees are still badly swollen, but I’m hoping that goes down as my body becomes healthier. I also had a UTI which has since cleared up with the help of unsweetened cranberry juice (it’s acidic so I tried to chase it with greens as much as possible). Overall, I am just feeling so much more positive and healthy. My next step is to continue to improve my eating habits and also keep from sliding back into bad ones (that is often easy for me to do once I start feeling better and don’t have such severe consequences of the Candida) Raster and Jo-Thank you both for your replies! I have been exercising more to “sweat” out the toxins and rediscovered a love for vegetables, which are very inexpensive, even as organic."

0,dannyle87,263,"Hi guys. I need some advice on how to adjust the diet as it seems impossible to be a serious athlete without any carbs. I am a professional tennis player and even though this diet and protocol has helped so much, I barely have energy during matches that sometimes last 2 to 3 hours. Anyone else dealing with this? The only thing I usually eat before i slots of brown rice as this is only thing that a decent of carbs that is allowed to give me some energy boost but other than that I feel drained during matches since I cant even have a banana without having an allergic reaction. I am even allergic to mineral water?! WTH is going on? Need help on how to prepare food wise for long lasting workouts please. BTW what happens if ingest sugar during an intense workout? Does the candida feed on it or does the body convert it into erngery? Who is faster?"
1,jamespaul,263,"hi there, im not a professional when it comes to candida, but i weight train 5 times a week, at 1st i also struggled, but now i have brown rice with every meal, and im eating 6 meals a day sometimes more, carbs 45 mins before a workout and striaght after hope this helps"
2,raster,263,"I’d try a few things. The first is I would try out teff which gives you a ton of energy. I have a good recipe for teff bread in the recipes part of the forum. The second is I’d try coconut water or kefir; I’ve been on the diet for over a year and the coconut water seems to agree with my body more than a green apple; I’ll only have it once every few weeks or so, but its great for when I am active. Pumpkin and greek yogurt also give me a ton of energy. Other tips I have include chewing your food more which will increase the surface area of the food you eat and it’ll allow greater absorption. Chew each bite over 30 times…it’ll improve your digestion as well. Digestive enzymes and swedish bitters also help you digest the food you eat better and will give you more energy from the same amount of foods. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1222_Chew-your-food-longer–Simple-tip-to-improve-your-health.aspx I recently learned a bunch about trace minerals and this by itself can improve your health: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst5419_Trace-Minerals.aspx Theo Ratliff who once played for my blazers in the NBA and extended his career 10 whole years by adding in trace minerals. This could also be the cause of your candida and health problems. I’d research trace mineral drinks and maybe the one in the youtube video I link in the above post. Hope this helps! -raster"
3,raster,263,"I’d also consider trying out acupuncture which is another cornerstone of my treatment. It detoxes the body, rebalances the body, and heals specific organs (on top of giving you energy and making you feel good). It probably is perfect for sports since you get some slight and nagging injuries now and then. -raster"
4,dannyle87,263,"Thanks guys. What do you think about increasing good fat? I read this article about that the body actually runs better on burning fat than carbs.  So i am talking about coconut oil, Olive oil, Avocados etc as well increased protein intake. I heard about coconut water but they say it contains too much sugar.. And what`s up the allergies. I cant have bananas or apples anymore, not even mineral water wihtout getting dizzy etc. I never used to have problems with these items. What is going on?"
5,raster,263,"Sounds like you have leaky gut which has to be healed separately. It takes a long time but you need specific supplements to heal it. The ones I take include digestive enzymes, L-glutamine, cinnamon, inulin (aka miracle fiber), prebiotics and probiotics. Bitters is another one that heals leaky gut and there is a big list of supplements that also work (but I have not tried them; I can share a link if needed). L-glutamine is the most popular and it helps with sugar sensitivities specifically. I am on stage 3 so I can handle cheating and some coconut water now and then, but early on in my treatment I could not handle fruit or any sugar (like you). Increasing good fat is important and you also need other essential fatty acids. Flax and hemp are examples of essential fatty acids (and I think coconut oil is another). I take a supplement with essential fatty acids called E3AFA which helps repair the brain. Carbs gives you short term energy that disappears quickly, so in my opinion, its not a super great source of energy. -raster"
6,Belganson,263,"Quinoa is high in carbs. I eat cold chicken and quinoa with lemon juice and sea salt when I need a lunch on the go. I also make a savory pancake that’s a great cold, snack that you can eat before or during your match. It has oat bran, which is 27g per 1/3 cup. Add 1 egg, 1/4 cup almond milk, 1/2 cup oat bran, salt, pepper and fresh basil. Cool like a pancake with a tiny bit of olive oil in the pan. I can’t get enough of these. You can also try adding almond butter with more milk rather than the s&p and basil to add a few more carbs. For a sweet pancake, add stevia and cinnamon. Again all are great to throw in a small cooler and eat and run. Good luck."
7,dannyle87,263,Thanks for all the replies guys. I am actually getting better now since I have been increasing the good fats. So ill try that for a while as I feel every little carb that I ingest.
0,dforbreakfast,264,"I felt so bad yesterday that I finally went to see an endocrinologist today — WITHOUT health insurance. Big mistake. I paid $400 to list my symptoms to a doctor and have her look alternately confused, annoyed, disgusted and perplexed. She said she had no idea what “bentonite clay” was, and I should get a second opinion from another immunologist on whether i really have systemic candida. She said that what I was explaining to her about what my last immunologist recommended after diagnosing me with leaky gut and systemic candida seemed “crazy”. She said from my symptoms she was primarily concerned with testing for AIDS, Lyme, Cushings Syndrome and TSH/T4 Free. She ordered a bunch of tests for tomorrow morning, but I called the lab today to see how much they would cost — $3,107.60!! I give up. I cancelled the tests. I’m moving across the country on Thursday. I’m $420 or so poorer, after paying the doctor for 20 minutes of talk, and buying the Dexamethasone for the cortisol test I can’t afford. I feel so defeated. There are days when I can barely speak or think I’m so tired. I missed my last period. My hair is falling out. Nightly migraines. I will stay on the strict diet and try to supplement as best I can. Maybe apply for Medicaid when I move. But I’m just.. defeated."
1,raster,264,"I’m sorry to hear this happen to you. I guess you learned your lesson that western medicine has major flaws across the board and that its very difficult to find a doctor that understands candida and how to treat it. I learned this early on when I told the doctors I was poisoned by the mold in my apartment. They couldn’t do squat even though mold poisoning has been thoroughly researched (it messes you up). For the same price you could’ve purchase a few months worth the supplements; stuff from thorne, standard process, integrative thereaputics, etc. If you visit their websites and check out their product lines, you’ll see that there is a whole industry built around treating candida and related health problems. Its just about finding someone who can use these tools and know how to use them for your specific version of candida. For the same price you could’ve also have gotten the genova diagnostics candida immune complex test that’ll give you hormone levels plus some acupuncture and sauna treatments on top of it. Its just money that you didn’t have and I feel your woes because I was out of work (for 2 years), unhealthy, and I became a cesspool with my lifestyle, thoughts, and mentality. Right before I was about to give up I ended up getting my old job back that ended up being my life preserver. Things can only get better. -raster"

0,momela,265,"5-7 years ago I started to have frequently recurring yeast infections. Today, I can barely have a night with my husband without an infection flaring up as soon as the next day.

Alternatively many people suggest yoghurt covered tampons, these never really worked for me but may for some people. I’m sure you do everything else I do, wear cotton knickers, sleep without knickers, use non scented shower gels. Taking oral probiotics should help however the capsules are expensive so you might want to consider making kefir which is cheap to make and strongly probiotic.

Thanks to you and anyone else for sharing Mel"
3,jo2212,265,"First of all you’ll probably need to warm your coconut oil up by putting it over boiling water, then let your tampon soak in it for a minute or two before inserting. Sleeping with it in would be most benefical, although like any tampon you don’t want to leave it in more than 8 hours. I know a lot of people also use coconut oil as a sexual lubricant, which may help keep your symptoms at bay when you feel ready to have sex again. Personally probiotics seem to positively effect my health in many ways so I hope they will have the same effect for you. I really hope you find a solution and good luck! Jo."

I was in your situation but for 2 whole years it never went away. You can imagine the effect it had on my sex life. I’ve been on the diet for nearly 5 months now and 3 months in was when I really noticed the difference. I think the yeast infection is still there very slightly but I have a sex life again which is such an improvement. The difference came when I started taking probiotics. I cant recommend them enough. I also started doing the coconut tampon thing at the same time, every day and inserted a probiotic tablet at night. I didnt do the cotton knickers / no knickers thing because itching wasnt really a problem. Going back to the coconut tampons. I use these organic ones http://www.amazon.co.uk/Natracare-Organic-Non-Applicator-Tampons-Regular/dp/B00005368L/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347178900&sr=8-1 and I keep my coconut oil in a place in my house thats always warm so that I never have to bother with melting it.

Mel  Hi Mel, Everybody who is dealing with an unresponsive fungal infection has an immune problem. Sometimes, minor, sometimes, mayor. Chronic fungal infections are associated to a deficient Cell-mediated immunity. Most, if not all, candida sufferers have an immune system polarized toward to a Th2 immune response. This is the cause why the yeast don’t go away and re-occur. There are several causative factors that influence that polarized immune response, one of them is the same presence of candida colonies in the colon. Other causes are heavy metal toxicity, chronic parasites, etc. There also are intrinsic immune defects since we are born. Jorge."

0,Rachel_Healing,267,"After many months of wanting to do the cleanse and knowing I needed to do it, I finally began the “easier” version of the cleanse four days ago. The day I began the cleanse I heard some wise words of advice: “cleansing need not be about deprivation. It is about filling your body with good things rather than starving yourself”. I am an unrepentant foodie, which is a large part of why I got myself into the candida jam. I love decadent and rich foods: chocolate, wine, cream-based and fried things, breads, cakes. All of these things can put me over the edge with human joy. So you can understand my reluctance in giving up all of these pleasures for a single health goal that may not even work and that most of my friends regard as quackery. No chocolate stout/gelato banana ice cream swirl float with a best friend? No cupcakes? No bacon cheeseburger? No wine on date night? And for something that may not even work! I had a lot to lose, but decided to take the plunge one morning after waking up from a night of heavy drinking with a yeast infection, the pain of a recurring UTI and a tongue covered in thrush. So I started in desperation. But what I have delightfully discovered about the “easier” version of the cleanse is the pleasure of discovering certain foods. Not only are these foods responsible for amazing health benefits, but they can be downright delicious. That said, the first three days of the cleanse for me were hell. I felt terrible with headache, thrush, ringing in the ears, feeling like I just wanted to sleep. And I still feel many of the die off symptoms on day four. But, I am slowly realizing the beauty in certain foods that I had previously overlooked. I make my own guacamole, mashing avocado, cilantro, TONS of garlic, lemon juice, a touch of very fine olive oil. Then, I roll it in a crisp seaweed square made with seaweed, sea salt and olive oil. Divine. Really. The sensual and elegant avocado and cilantro meld perfectly with the crispy, ocean taste of seaweed. Crispy outside. Smooth inside. Kind of like a chocolate lava cake only no guilt after finishing it. And the colors look amazing together too: pale avocado green and deep forest. I am enjoying kimchi too, a probiotic food with a lively and tangy constitution. I also discovered a kind of saurkraut from a brand called “Wild Brine” which contains only cabbage, arame (a sea plant), ginger, and sea salt. When you taste it you may find yourself surprised that it does not contain vinegar such are the powers of fermentation. Fantastic. I’ve also re-discovered fennel which I love for its strangely elegant and distinct flavor. It makes a crispy salad with olive oil, lemon, salt, pepper and a touch of cider vinegar. Fennel is also sublime roasted. Roasting caramelizes it a bit and distills its flavor. And let’s not forget coconut oil. When I first read about its powerful anti-fungal properties I somewhat begrudgingly bought my first jar from my local health food store. “It’s expensive and will taste like hell” I lamented to myself. Not the case. I discovered coconut oil to be decadent and sensuous and just one jar to be an affordable investment. The stuff has an ethereal flavor—fruity, playful and very unique. I’m eager to bake a coconut bread recipe I saw posted earlier. For dinner I am enjoying a glass of my stevia lemonade and a spaghetti squash which I roasted with fine olive oil and sea salt. And I’m wondering how spaghetti squash got on the list in the first place. I feel as if I’m consuming a little bowl of angel hair pasta with roasted pumpkin seeds on top. Maybe I’ll add some garlic next time for an even richer Italian flavor. Also in my growing cache of new foods discovered is dandelion root tea. It is so comforting and has an almost bread-like/yeast-y taste. Pau d’Arco, though not as delicious still has some what of a deep, grounding taste. Also, I visit juice bars for juice blends of kale, cucumber, ginger, lemon, and whatever dark leafy greens are available. The drink tastes thick, grassy, wholesome and the ginger packs a kick. This cleanse, while enormously challenging, can be an excellent way to discover and more fully understand neglected but powerfully healthful foods. I have barely even scratched the surface of the spice list. The amount of foods you can make from the short list of acceptable foods hardly gives room for complaint. For me, the way to go about this cleanse is not to look at through the lense of deprivation and denial, but rather to see it as a gustatory delight. I can only imagine what this will be like when I can add chicken. Bon appetit and bye candida!"
1,Latka,267,Such an inspiring post! And I think you are on to something: that is focusing on enjoying what you can have instead of obsessing over what you cannot. This will make the journey so much easier and help with healing. I have to say that if I gained something from being on this candida diet it is learning to cook and becoming more creative in the kitchen. And that I’m grateful for.

5,Rachel_Healing,267,What can I say? I had to find a silver lining in that pile of vegetables!!! Happy cleansing!
6,ucantbevan,267,Good to hear! Thanks for the post.
7,RickiH,267,"It was so great to read this! I also came to rediscover some foods and appreciate others–there are definitely foods I would never have tasted at all if not for the candida diet. It’s also made me a more creative cook, as I have to find alternatives for things I like(d) to eat. Thanks for the positive spin on what is often not a very positive experience!"
8,Clare_,267,I had ratabaga soup for dinner and I found it almost too sweet to eat. Giving up sugar makes the palate shift; foods I would not have associated with ‘sweetness’ are now naturally sweet.
9,alphax,267,"Bon Appetit, Rachel! It’s good to know that amongst the many threads here about struggling to have a grasp of the cleansing diet, one was able to “slide” through it, and enjoying it! Haha! Certainly events in our lives make us look at things in a different way, and we wonder, why have we not seen that all along. Thanks Rachel for this inspiring post. I myself is on the way of rediscovering what healthy diet is all about. And while I sometimes suffer from the effects of die-off, I just think longer term. It will be over, and I’ll be healthy again."

It was refreshing to read a post so eloquently written and descriptive. I, too, see the best sides of this diet but cannot describe my journey with such color and zest! I never thought I would purchase rutabaga at the store! I hope more people on the diet can see wonderful side of it with discovery and new palate experiences. Oooh, and thanks for the fennel idea. Never thought of eating that one."
0,AlexandraEl,268,"My beloved mom requested her friend having a job of the doctor to make out a receipt in the form of appetite suppressant.

0,PujaP16,269,"Hi everyone, I’m 19 years old and have been suffering from eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, allergies, and asthma since I was 3 months old (eczema mainly). I’ve tried EVERYTHING to get rid of my problems and when I was advised to go on this diet I was so excited. I started in late May and have been doing it since. The problem is I keep messing up. I give in to sugary items when I crave them and then beat myself up for it for hours, I usually cry and get so upset and disgusted with myself. I know that this will cure my problem as when I eat these items my asthma returns and I usually break out, yet I still do it sometimes. I was wondering if anyone had advice for me. I’m new to this and really respect all of you who have been sticking with it. I know I can do it when I try and it will be so fulfilling, I’m just upset with myself today for messing up again. Thank you all so much, hope to hear from you soon All the best, Puja"
1,raster,269,"Hello Puja, One way I would start to think of things is what the majority of the food out their is poisoneous or a detriment to not only your health, but the health of everyone around the world. You are what you eat, and if you eat nothing but fast food, ice cream, and cereal…thats what you are, a junk food kid! I would also consider educating yourself about the food industry and what kind of damage they are doing to our bodies, the environment, our genes, and our gut flora. For instance, learn about GMO foods and how they alter out genetic codes, gut flora, brain chemistry and more. They are even developing new “vaccines” that allow our bodies to cope and assimiliate this new group of GMO foods. Sugar is typically and often genetically altered and this is the main reason it should not be consumed. Its one of the causes to all of your problems and you should look at it as poison. Don’t cry about it afterwards, think about how that nice treat was…and move on. Sugar also ruins the environment and causes soil erosion, pH alteration, and a whole host of problems. The 3rd world often deforests prime land in order to plant sugar and thus harms the planet. -raster"
2,BusGirl,269,"I would consider making the things you crave less accessible. Are you popping a candy or sweet into your mouth without thinking about it just because it’s there? If so, keep things like that out of sight, so you don’t have the opportunity to just grab something in passing. If you live with other people, kindly ask them to support you in your decision to make yourself healthy and well. Request that they don’t bring those foods into the house, and those foods will make you sick. They care about you, and wouldn’t want to see you ill. Instead of beating yourself up after the fact, take a few seconds or minutes to think about the effects you will feel, compared to how much satisfaction that item of food will give you. Is one minute of satisfaction equal to several days of bad skin and feeling sick equal? You have to decide that. You have to think of it this way: Is my action worth the consequence. You can also try to replace the craving with something else. Maybe you go out for a walk down the street, or put on your favourite song and belt out to lyrics until the craving subsides. Find a healthy alternative to popping that candy/chocolate/whatever into your mouth, and give yourself some time to process what it is you are about to do to yourself. Hope that helps. Good luck in your journey, and be strong!!"
3,Latka,269,"I think the key is to be prepared and to not go hungry. If you get hungry and didn’t bring any food with you that you can eat, it’s a lot easier to get cravings and then give into these cravings. Cravings aren’t always a sign of mental weakness alone; they can also be caused by hunger or if you are not getting enough energy from your food. Or if there are huge swings in your blood sugar levels. Being prepared and bringing snacks with you where ever you go can help. If blood sugar regulation might be your problem getting into a habit of snacking often could be helpful too. After having read about Dr McCombs blood sugar balance protocol i am trying to incorporate his advice to eat something small every hour in order to regulate my blood sugar levels; this could be something like 1/3 of a stick of celery. I actually hate celery but it’s just a small stick of celery every hour, it’s no big deal. And I have already noticed some improvements in my energy levels throughout the day."
4,alphax,269,"If I could also suggest you find an alternative to those foods that you so longingly crave that you would not be guilty of eating. Maybe some fruity variant of the same food that you like to eat. In that way, you do not feel remorseful and at the same time, you gave in to a crave without that much guilt. Try to search big G for any of these foods. For me, following a diet to the T is okay, but feeling yourself deprived of something is another thing. Try to strike a balance between the two."
0,Andrea Binder,270,"I´m following all the foods you can eat on diet for about 3 weeks and still have discharge.I thought it would be less by now.Does anyone have info or suggestions about this? I´m also taking anti-fungals(GSE,oreg oil and caprylic acid) and good pro-biotics.A bit frustrated but I have to admit I have been told it could take awhile for symptoms to fade away."
1,Determined,270,"From personal experience, yes, I think it can. Mine seemed to get a lot worse during the first three weeks of my diet. After two months, it’s pretty much normalized. My guess is it’s just another way your body is trying to rid itself of excess toxins. It’s just my intuition, and two cents, however :). Someone with more experience may be able to chime in on what’s happening."
2,Javizy,270,"Any improvement is likely to take time, but a sudden switch in diet can affect things like blood sugar, immunity, metabolism etc and all could potentially worsen your symptoms. They could even be a large part of what’s causing them in the first place."
3,Andrea Binder,270,Thanks for your answers!! This candida stuff can get pretty confusing sometimes but I find patience and perseverence go a long way!! 🙂
4,alphax,270,I guess that’s always been the case for anyone who’s into the recovering stages. It may get worse before it actually normalizes and eventually you shall notice a big change in the amount of your discharge. You just need to be patient! Just keep on following your diet religiously and do not get too excited about the results.
0,lmm,271,"Hello All, I’m fairly new to the world of Candida, and its treatment. For 8 months, I’ve been experiencing very low stomach acid, extreme weight loss, the usual stomach complaints, brainfog, thrush on my tongue, generalized tiredness, dry eyes, etc.,that go with Candida. Recently, a stool test result reviewed I have medium to high level Candida. I found this hard to believe, because I assumed that Candida was less likely in men. But I have had a history which may have predisposed me to yeast – a period of alcohol abuse and periodic steroid use when I was younger, living with M.E. for 5 years, and a lot of stress at work. My immune system has been very poor for some years, and I suspect that I was treading water due to the Candida. I’ve now begun to do the cleanse, which is leaving me feeling rather dreadful and isolated, so it’s a great comfort that there are like-minded and motivated on the forum to talk to. I’m determined to beat the yeast, so that I can resume some modicum of a ‘normal’ existence! Cheers, Len"

0,Molly,273,"Hi I couldn’t find any related topics so decided to write about my situation. I was recently diagnosed with chronic cystitis, presumably caused by atypical bacteria (they haven’t done the tests to confirm this as apparently those tests are very expensive) I was put on three months antibiotics and we will see how it goes. Normal bacteria were never detected eihter in my urine nor during the bladder biopsis. The antibiotic dose is quite low I only take one 400mg tablet a day. Since I suffer from recurring thrush I did ask the doctor if possibly it is not thrush that causes the inflamtion, but he said the thrush was not detected in my urine. It all started three years ago, first I got recurring thrush and few months later I had problems when passing urine( stinging and burning and going to toilet more and more often) I have been taking antibiotic for last month but there is no difference and symptoms remain the same. In the meantime my thrush got worse so again I started the diet. I’m after 5 days of detox and die off was pretty horrible, I stoped taking antibiotic for now as I want to get through the worse first and most effectively where as obviously antibiotic will delay the whole process if not make it worse.. My question is, is it possible the the chronic inflamation of my bladder is caused by my ongoing yeast infections even tho thrush was not detected in my urine? Do you perhaps have an advice if I should just continue taking antibiotics or perhaps start taking them again after the detox, during the actual diet while i’ll be on stronger probiotics? One last thing, can vaginal thursh be one of the die off symptoms? It got bad again, after few days of calmness I would be very grateful to get some advice. Thanks"

2,scandigirl,274,"Five days ago I found a tip against candida at another site and I started having juiced vegetables only and about 10 grams of vitamin C daily (I am used to 5-10 grams vitamin C daily from several years). I didn’t know about die-off problems before I found this site yesterday and started reading. So unfortunately I wasn’t prepared. I ordered Molybdenum and Milk thistle last night, should receive it in 2-5 days. I will try to find Milk thistle in a shop here today, but I doubt Molybdenum is available in my country. I will also look for other supplements for die-off symptoms but I’m afraid I won’t find anything but detox teas. I will buy several and drink many cups a day. And I will continue with vitamin C, I will try to increase the dosage a bit to see if I can exceed my bowel tolerance (would be helpful in case of constipatio, too). Other than that I can do a bit of exercise. I feel like I have the flu today (dizzy, pain in my ears, muscle ache, chills and very difficult sleeping last night). I will not start with anti-fungals before having Molybdenum for 3-4 days. (Although I’m having garlic and vitamin C now, I guess they are anti-fungals).If I only have the liver flush drink, detox teas, vitamin C and exercise the next 2-5 days while waiting for the Molybdenum, could die-off be harmful to me? Should I quit cleansing and wait for the Molybdenum? About possible constipation I will try as many of your tips as possible, thank you so much for the link. I haven’t had any bentonite clay and I doubt it’s available in my country anyway. I would have liked to take a soluble fiber supplement, but unfortunately I have done that in the past and very unlucky ended up in the hospital with intestinal obstruction (a potentially fatal side effect). For all I know I am susceptible to get that, so I just need to avoid soluble fiber supplements, trying would give me lots of anxiety (I don’t need more right now). Squash and avocados are soluble fiber foods that have helped me before, maybe I could have some avocado even though they’re not really allowed during cleanse?

0,telsbels,275,"Hi All, I’ve recently come to the realisation that Yeast may be my problem. I’ve suffered from increasingly frequent bouts of vaginal thrush for a number of years which has progressively got worse since having 2 children (like every 2 weeks,3 weeks,a month, 2 months, kinda frequency). I’m 30 years old and unfortunately have been precribed antibiotics fairly frequently by my GP who probably thought she was helping me to get over my respiratory infections quicker so I can look after my two BUSY little boys. I’ve been on the pill on and off since I was about 15 to help with heavy periods and acne + I was also on antibiotics for a long time (approx 2 yrs minimum) for more treatment of my acne. I’ve also had a number of asthma puffers throughout my life. + all the sugary foods in my diet. I think I need to turn things around seriously: I’m really hooking into my new probiotic – Candex by inner health plus Taking a Yeast Care Tablet by Swisse & Taking a Multivitamin My GP just put me on a new pill but I think I’ll need to give that up at the end of the month. Now with the diet, I’m just starting out working out which products are good and which are not."
1,flailingWcandi,275,"I’m no expert but, the probiotic choice might not be the best. Sure it contains 40 billion Pro-B’s per dose but, 32 billion are a single stain -> 32 Billion Lactobacillus acidophilus (NCFM) Organisms 4 Billion Lactobacillus rhamnosus (GG) Organisms (LGG®) 4 Billion Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Boulardii) Organisms Bifidobacterium is one you will want to have on your next purchase."
2,Javizy,275,"Do you need the pills for contraception? The excess o/estrogen can cause a lot of problems, and oral contraceptives are linked with yeast overgrowth. As far as I understand, oestrogen has some kind of stimulatory effect, since yeasts naturally produce oestrogen too (it’s why most alcoholic drinks are oestrogenic). Did you ever explore other reasons behind the menstrual problems and acne? I can’t claim to understand female hormones very well, but the ratio of oestrogen to progesterone is supposed to be around 1:10. It seems hard to maintain given oestrogenic cosmetics, pollutants, foods, drugs etc, as well as poor gut or liver function that prevent it from being expelled. I’ve heard of women getting their period back after months without it after using natural progesterone (the synthetic progestins are carcinogenic), so maybe it can help regulate things. Have you ever had your levels tested? Vitamin A intake seems to have some relationship with acne, but gut problems and other issues can contribute too."
3,telsbels,275,"Thanks. I have run out of the candex so I’m just using the shared bottle of reg 25 billion inner health pls my hubby uses. I never looked into the reasons for my period and acne. It doesn’t seemto bethatmuch of an issue anymore. The pill is more for contraception nowadays but I’m considering just monitoring my cycle on a femilia website. Pregancy is not entirely unwelcome. I did actually mean to post initially about where you canbuy this stuff from in Australia. The flours, oils etc. Are there specific brands or products that are good? So far I’ve only found Pure 100% brown rice flakes for crumbing, thickening casseroles etc. and some Quinoa Flour. All the rest of the breads, and specialty products say ‘buckwheat’ or ‘millet’ or ‘brown rice’ or ‘quinoa’ but have corn maize or reg rice as well. Have found just cutting out obvious sugars and bread makes a huge difference. Have not gone down detox road just yet as I feel alright. If I need to, will.

0,MyTummyHurts,277,"–Skip down if you don’t want to read the story and just hit my questions. First off all I would like to say is WOW! All the pieces have fallen together, so lets start it off. It all starts in middle school 7th grade, where every night I would have ice cream, and then waffles in the morning. During school I would have gas and would always go to the bathroom to let it out. Also, my mom would always drive me and my friends home from school everyday, and I would hold in some of the gas at the end because I couldn’t leave 6th period and I would let it out in the car (yes i know gross) but it was funny and we would joke about it. I also was diagnosed with asthma at this time. This is when my candida started. Now this continues on untill 8th, 9th, and 10th grade, the same bloating and having bad gas. Except in 9th grade, I would of course have ice cream, but then would always have cereal in the morning (skim so more lactose yey) because I loved cinnamon toast crunch. I would have it as snacks during the day also when I got home. Sooner or later this bad gas and bloating turns into something worse. I would have cereal and now instead of just having gas, I would have extreme pains in my stomach to where I would have to put my head down in class. I would go to the clinic in my highschool call my parents to pick me up, and then use the restroom in the clinic and destroy it lol. Anyways this goes on for a month or two until I go to the doctors. They diagnose it and say that I have become lactose intolerant. Yet guess what? I now realized that I became lactose intolerant in seventh grade. Since my body stopped producing lactase in 7th grade, the milk moved down to my colon where my good bacteria would undergo fermentation which produces a lot of gas. The bacteria that ferments the lactose is lactobacillus acidophilus. I believe this is when the yeast started growing, since I ingested so much lactose, not only did the bacteria ferment it, but so did the yeast. And when an antibacterial was prescribed, bacteria was removed from the gut and the yeast grew like crazy. As the years went on, my body had less bacteria (specifically lactobacillus acidophilus) which caused me to have massive stomach pains and diarrhea. The same time this happened sophomore year, I started getting acne. I couldn’t get rid off it so my doctors prescribes anti-bacterials for flare ups. This is when things it got worse. More symptoms of candida started to pop up like depression, and insomnia, foggy brain (people would joke around how I was out of it). Quiting the soccer team after freshman year, starting to smoke pot, etc. Junior and Senior year were terrible, had random depression etc. During probably the middle of freshman year at college things started to get better. I’m guessing since I had a meal plan I would always go there. I always drank water there, and there pasta section was disgusting so I never ate there. The majority of food I would eat was meat and vegetables. Sure enough my I would be less depressed, made a lot of friends by the end of the semester. Since I didn’t kill all the yeast off, here comes the relapse. After returning from winter break about a month in I find out that they have chicken sandwiches on buns. And since I started running a lot and working out, I start eating tons of them (a lot more wheat). I also start parting a lot more and drinking a lot more alcohol (pretty bad amounts at a time). The symptoms come back and are a lot worse. Now I have ibs, and have to be very careful to what I eat. My sexual arousal has decreased enough for me to visit a urologist. Fast forward to summer I start drinking a hell of a lot more, eating a lot of bread products, etc. Other information: *Extremely tired after eating bread *Night Sweats my whole life *Respiratory problems (asthma) *Allergies, and food allergies *Sexual arousal decreased/problems went to see urologist. *Very strong weird kind of taste in my mouth in the morning Anyways from all this information I’m pretty damn sure I have candida. I didn’t do the cleanse because I think that is overkill and just started the candida diet. The first three days were miserable and had a massive head-ache like expected when you start killing yeast. Since then it has gone away and now the die-off symptoms have lessened. On the road to recovery. —————————————————————————- Questions: 1. I began having die-off symptoms in the beginning when I started the diet. I am using a natural anti-fungal grapefruit seed extract, but I am not having any die-off symptoms. Should I try or use something else? What about diflucan? 2. Since I mix the grapefruit seed extract with water, do you believe it is making it to the yeast in the gut and colon? Or just being absorbed before it can make its way there? 3. My acne is directly related to this. I take probiotics, i’m clear. If I eat a lot of bread, drink alcohol, etc I get cysts. Anyone know how this is related? 4. How long do you think till I get better since this has been going on for quite a long time?"
0,Magical1,278,"How this started: I got a bad fingernail infection. Read up on it, realized I had almost all the symptoms of candida including brain fog and digestive problems. I am grateful to the infection for pointing me in the right direction. Started supplements. Can’t do coconut oil, it makes me so sick, I think I am allergic to it. So I’m going to wait until week four or five to start it again. Week one: Awful. Rashes all over fingers, face broke out, dizziness, headaches, nausea, diarrehea, gas. Only ate: Avocados (lots), zucchini, salad no dressing, cucumbers, tiny amounts of chicken. Ate a few almonds, still not sure about the almonds. At end of week one discovered zucchinis and green beans are my favorite new foods. Started Benzonite. Also, I am raising two kids under the age of three and I started a new weekend job that week. So I was exhausted, on the brink of passing out, and trying to keep it together while I was at the park with my kids. Had to run to the bathroom a lot, with baby in bjorn – not an easy task! Threw up after eating wild salmon. Lost five pounds and I am skinny to begin with. Felt all around terrible. Week two: A break from awful! Four days without any symptoms! Three days – regression back to awful. Decided to cut out chicken. But drank almond milk after feeling crampy (got my period, yikes). Feeling more energetic, started taking B vitamins with no yeast which improved energy. At end of week two, my hands got so dry they started cracking. Had a rough time at a wedding. Tried eating a salad there, bad idea. Overall symptoms are less than first week, I keep reminding myself. Week three: Fingernail infection is completely GONE! I watched it heal over last few weeks, so cool! Hands soft! Used olive oil on skin, worked overnight. Feeling SO MUCH better. Woke up once with bad taste in mouth after eating unsweetened Greek yogurt yesterday. Any advice on this? After I ate it, I had no digestive problems and I felt really good so why the bad taste? Overall, week one and part of week two were the worst weeks ever. But now I feel I am making progress and I am grateful for this new start in life so I can be stronger and healthier for my kids. Cutting out meat seemed to help me. I’d rather be on the diet than be sicker later."
1,paulkur89234,278,I am just so proud of your sincere determination. You’re an inspiration to all of us undergoing the same dieting.
2,Magical1,278,"Thank you for your support! End of week 3 – no digestion problems except for gas and in the middle of the night, I am so hungry I can hear my stomach churning. It makes it impossible to sleep! Also, waiting for bags under eyes to go down, but that might also be from raising two babies. Any opinion on greek yogurt?"
3,Kamilion,278,"Ashwagandha is amazing for sleep, Able posted about it as an alternative to melatonin, valerian and other sleep inducing herbs. I gave it a try after my melatonin was no longer working for me. It works wonders I take 2-3 a day a few hours before bed. Your best bet would be to make your own yoghurt."
4,Magical1,278,"Thanks so much – will try it! What about raw butter? Store bought but raw/organic…I’ve been eating it with the green beans. Also, kelp noodles I found at Whole Foods in the refrigerated section? The only ingredient is seaweed. They are crunchy and weird but if I eat with spinach, they are filling. Thanks for the comments and for this forum."
5,Kamilion,278,"Raw organic butter is a controversial food, it’s about finding out what works for you and if dairy is well tolerated and it works for you that’s great! A good alternative is ghee but it’s also controversial. I’m currently just started the cleanse, but prior to that I did love a little butter on occasion with green beans with sea salt! I’d suggest to enjoy it in moderation!"

7,Magical1,278,Thanks. Don’t know why but ghee makes me feel sick. Same with coconut oil. So mostly frying in water and then putting olive oil on top after cooking.

You’re an inspiration. Hang in there! Sounds like you’re making progress."
9,Magical1,278,"Thanks so much! It is tricky with two little kids but in some ways it might be easier in that I honestly don’t have time to get depressed. We stay in some days when I get too exhausted. I don’t think they notice, they’re happy playing at home once in awhile. Four weeks – things are going much better. Looking back, week one and two were really hard. But now, I only had one bad day in the last two weeks! I am not eating much. When I stop to think of how much I used to eat every meal, it seems ridiculous. Now, I go most of the day without eating and when I snack it’s on green beans usually and sometimes almonds (more than a handful is bad for me though). Recently I introduced spinach, broccoli (only handle a little bit or I feel nauseous) a little greek yogurt and tiny bits of quinoa (1/4 cup a day of red quinoa for breakfast). For a treat, I have half an apple with cinnamon sprinkled on top – delicious! Also, kelp noodles (mentioned above) are helping me stay full. I think not eating meat has made the biggest difference. Also make a zucchini soup now – just three zucchinis, water, a lemon squeeze, two onions, some herbs de provence spices, and sea salt – boiled and then mixed up with a hand blender in the pot! Good for two days of food. Still having sleep issues but I ordered the stuff recommended above and should get it soon. Hang in there fellow troopers!"
10,Magical1,278,"Week four still: Good things: fingernail healed, skin healed. I introduced oat bran fiber, that helped on the bad days when I get diarrehea. Things that could use improving: I’m so tired! It hit me this week more than before. Knees hurt. Also mucus after stool? I hope this is the candida coming out! I started eating small amounts of meat again. Helped energy initially but now am really really tired. I’m still eating so many vegetables…and now used to eating large amounts of those."
11,Magical1,278,"One Month Update: Now on week five: Good news, my energy just came back! Feeling great! And I actually woke up three days in a row feeling happy! I can’t remember how long it’s been since I felt like that in the morning. I took both kids to the park all day and then to ikea (if you can believe it) and no problems! (Sorry to be graphic here:) Still have really werid smelling gas now and then but my stools are floating instead of sinking now. Overall, I’m looking way better! Dark circles under eyes are starting to fade. My skin is pinker. My fingernail got yellow again but didn’t get that much worse, I am soaking in watered down hydrogen peroxide (read about it online), we’ll see how that goes. Eating: A lot of cucumbers, avocados, no more chicken but a tiny bit of red meat (not sure why chicken has bad effect, maybe bacteria?), green beans all the time (seriously, like 100 green beans a day), zucchini, spinach, FAGE full fat greek yogurt, coconut butter and coconut bread (the bread tastes like cardboard and has completely cured me of wanting it), seaweed, half of an apple a day. Can’t do eggs, raw almonds, chicken. However, made some almond bread and it didn’t effect me like raw almonds did, maybe the baking kills mold? I am now in the habit of making the exact same meals every day and taking them with me in tuperware wherever I go. I haven’t eaten out in over a month, very liberating! Once you decide that you can’t eat anything in restaurants anyway, you start enjoying making your own food. Some cool things I learned: Olive oil is amazing – I put a few drops in my bath and I rub it in my skin at night. I rub it under my eyes and on my fingernail. My skin is silky smooth now. Also, I brush my teeth with baking soda and my teeth are really white, someone even asked me if I had them whitened. Toothpastes have sweeteners in them so you have to be careful."
12,Able900,278,"Can’t do coconut oil, it makes me so sick, I think I am allergic to it. So I’m going to wait until week four or five to start it again. I don’t know of anyone who didn’t say the same thing in the beginning, but if you want four or five weeks, you will have lost a lot, a LOT of time on the treatment. Coconut oil is one of the paramount ingredients of a Candida treatment. You could start with as little as ¼ of a teaspoon which is barely enough to swallow and work your way up. People give up on this way too easy considering what they have at stake.Ate a few almonds Almonds equal mold, Candida love mold as it adds to a beneficial environment.But drank almond milk See above. If you have to drink something besides water and lemon water, try coconut milk, sugar-free. If you can’t find sugar-free, do without it.Overall, week one and part of week two were the worst weeks everProbably caused by the dying Candida toxins. Did you take precautions against the aldehyde toxins in your body produced by dying Candida? If so, which precautions.Cutting out meat seemed to help me. Cutting out meat is a wise decision. The ammonia released by the animal protein will build a favorable environment in which the Candida can continue to grow and multiply. Read the protocol others are using.  The Protocol Able"
0,rock1973,279,The mold exposure and this condition has basically destroyed 6 years of my life.. and also taken allot of things away from me i wanted to accomplish. Im almost 40 now. Its frustrating.. Has this condition affected anyone else in a similar way??
0,Tulip,280,"Ok,this a long one,so bear with me.Ever since I was 11 or 12,I’ve had Candida symptoms,even though I didn’t know that they were in fact them! Depression,acne,digestive issues,food sensitivities,low blood sugar,fainting,one year and a half I got hives every single day,was diagnosed with gluten intolerance,anxiety,poor management of stress,confusion,brain fog,distraction,weight flotation,you name it,I’ve pretty much had it! About a year and a half ago I had a horrible digestive issue,was was termed interstitial cystitis.I was on the bus to my university with a friend and had god awful pain in my stomach,I should’ve have turned right around and gone home,but I stupidly went to campus on two buses,had classes and lunch,studied,then went on the bus home.On the bus home I had even worse pain,I cannot compare it to anything.The only person I could get through to via my cell phone was a friend in Alaska.It was traumatic for me;I’ve never dealt with physical pain well,and I associated the bus with pain from then afterwards. My mother,a RN,took me to a urologist who did not help at all.He put me on some strong medication but ever since then I’ve had increasingly painful times.I could barely eat for a while and lived off soy and almond milk and yogurt (horrible for Candida now that I think about). Over the years my mother had me put on various medications for acne and for allergies.These and birth control for three years really fed the fungus and weekend my immunity as well as fed my symptoms.This year I finally I read about Candida on the Body Ecology website.As I was reading through the symptoms,my left leg was jerking like crazy,I kept getting distracted and staring out the window,I felt alternately hyperactive and exhausted.I realized what I had,and since the only unhealthy thing in my diet that could possibly be feeding Candida was fruit,I cut out my daily papayas,bananas,figs and dates (hard to but out the first two when you live in Hawai’i!) .I went through three days of Hell like die off,where I was bloated about twenty pounds,nauseated,could barely walk and move,flu like symptoms,and barely feasible digestion.Yet I knew I was doing the right thing.(Also last year and earlier this year I was raw vegan,which seriously messed me up.) About three weeks later I was going to yoga teacher training on Maui so I had to get my act together.I didn’t do quite enough research and I continued to eat beans and grains while on Maui,and succumbed to a raw vegan nut cheesecake there.This obviously fed the fungus and about a week after I came back,I got another die off,though it was less mild.I did a week of vegetable juices and Bentonite clay twice a day,which really helped.But I continued to eat beans and grains,and was exhausted,bloated,and depleted.A fellow yoga teacher told me to eat some meat or fish,that my body was having a hard time converting the insulin from the beans and grains.I went and got wild salmon immediately after talking with her.After two weeks of eating salmon,I feel so much better.I have few digestive issues,my skin is glowing,I have more energy and stamina,am more clear headed,the anxiety and depression are pretty much gone.I have since started eating eggs as well to break up the proteins.I consume olive oil and avocados for healthy fats,and I feel so much better;most of all,I feel alive,which seems to take a while with Candida.I refuse to give in to the fungus’ cravings for fruit and sweeteners.I realize that this a long term commitment to my health,my self,my body,and I sign on for the long term. Maybe the only thing I’ll miss coming up is my annual pumpkin pie for my birthday.But I know that are far many more important things in life,and I am so grateful for all that I have,for my health,and my progression with Candida."
0,Determined,281,"Just finished week three. Still hanging in there, folks! Holy crap the diet is awful, but I’m very proud to say I’ve not strayed even once. It was my son’s birthday last week. I survived dinner out at a very decadent steak house. Roasted chicken (no skin) and steamed broccoli (no butter), which was actually a treat compared to everything else I’ve been eating. I survived an all you can eat buffet by eating hard boiled eggs with lemon and pepper wrapped in spinach leaves. Survived ice cream cake (not even a teensy taste). I survived a festival with the smells of deep fried fat foods and kettle corn assaulting my senses. Summer is not the best time to start this, it seems….but I’ll always have next summer…or the next. I keep reminding myself that before any weakness takes hold. I just really want to get better. I’ve developed thrush. Like, this thing trying to crawl it’s way out of my body now! I’m doing the coconut oil pulling to keep it at bay. I also rinse afterwards with salt water and a bit of tea tree oil. I’ve also been using my netti pot with salt and a bit of tea tree oil. Seems to be helping.  And, there’s still the exhaustion. To top it all off — sorry guys in advance for the following graphic description– I started my period last week. This is the period to top all periods. I’ve never bled so heavily and for so long in my life. And it’s still going. And going. I feel like my insides are liquifying and falling out. Is this even normal? Am I going to get anemia? Anyone had any experience with this is free to comment. I did finally get the molybdenum. Not sure if it’s helping, or if there is something else wrong, or if I just have a very bad case of candida and it’s a good thing I’m working my way up slowly. I’m taking the supplements listed in the protocol. I’ve started slowly with the antifungals. I’m only up to 6 teaspoons of coconut oil a day, and working my way up. I’m afraid to add any other antifungal yet. I still haven’t started with probiotics. I did get the kefir grains, and it will probably be a few more days before it starts making the homemade kefir. In all honesty, I’m feeling a bit discouraged and depressed. Like I’m forcing punishment on myself. I am constantly haunted by dreams of eating foods I shouldn’t be eating. I’m still exhausted. Totally exhausted. I’m trying very hard not to be a downer about this, but sometimes it’s so hard when you’re feeling so horrible. I know it’s only been three weeks, but it seems all this hard work should start yielding a reward. I know it’s going to take a long time, and I should be patient. I’ll make my reward the right to whine a little bit. How’s that? Thanks for letting me share."

Like many others on the forum, I’ve endured a long exhausting journey with candida. But, what other option is there? It sounds like you’re doing great. Stay strong…and good luck!"
4,Jackie2,281,"Good for you. Sounds like your doing great. I have only gone out to dinner a few times and last Sat. went to a wedding. They had asparagus, a huge tray of cut steamed veggies. I ate a ton. I must say the best part was having someone else do all the cutting and chopping of the vegetabes for me. I’m glad your doing so well and have such a positive attitude…that is 1/2 the battle. How is the thrush? I too have that and continue to battle it 9 months in…only in the back of my throat…tonsil area…so disturbing. I may try what your doing. I only did oil pulls. Best of luck and thanks for sharing."

6,Determined,281,"Thank you all so much for the moral support. It means so much to know I’m not in this alone. 🙂 I finally got my homemade kefir going, and I’m pretty excited about it. Been drinking it the past few days and I’m actually feeling pretty good. I only feel slightly nauseous after taking the coconut oil as an anti fungal, and I usually feel that more in the evening. The exhaustion has let up a bit, so I’m going to add another anti fungal to the mix in about a week. The thrush is still there, and seems to be coming and going. I have been a bit lazy with the oil pulling this past week because it hasn’t been too bothersome."

0,Rachel_Healing,283,"I am seven days in to my cleanse. I spent the first 5 days eating only vegetables prescribed on the “foods to eat during cleanse list”, water, tea, etc. On day six I began eating rice, eggs and kefir because I had to work and wanted to excercise. I felt all of the classic symptoms of die off during the cleanse: feeling like I had the flu, increased mucuous production, headache, etc. However, those symptoms gradually went away and by the morning of day 5 I felt much better. But now, on day seven, I have a white tongue. A fuzzy white thrush tongue. Still. I am so discouraged that I am still dealing with this after all the misery of of the first five days of the cleanse. I feel like I will never be able to live a normal life, enjoy going out like normal people, or have sex without worrying about painful UTIs. Any suggestions? What am I doing wrong? I am also constipated for two days now. I’m scheduled for a colonic tomorrow which should hopefully provide some bowel relief and cleanse out dead yeast. Any comments would be helpful."
1,Clare_,283,"Perhaps lay off the excercise. Your body has enough damage to heal, without creating more. Is the tea caffeine free? Keep away from caffeine; it will fatigue your adrenals. Get as much rest as you can, and drink lots of vegie and bone broths."
2,raster,283,"Don’t be discouraged because the oral thrush will come and go as you heal. You won’t even come close to killing off all of the candida with the cleanse and it takes a very long time to heal. Plan on a 6-18 month recovery period to get over candida overgrowth. Whenever you are ready to start the diet, go for it! The cleanse isn’t meant to last a long time. I second what clare said and don’t do the exercise. You need your energy to heal and it can set you back. Plan on starting to do that regularly again in a month or two when you get your legs underneath you more. -raster"
3,paulkur89234,283,I think you need to also balance your diet. Doing it for 7 days might have drastically changed your body system. You need to get your body ready for whatever diet you will do.
4,Magical1,283,"If you read my post, I had really awful die off for two weeks. But by week three it gets better! I would try to not exercise until you’ve done a month of it at least…"
5,Javizy,283,"What sort of exercise do you do, and how much? Cardio literally = stress, so the less of that you do the better. Anaerobic exercise like sprints and intensive resistance training avoids many of the cardio pitfalls, and gives you much more bang for your buck in terms of improving fitness, metabolism, weight loss, muscle tone etc. It’s usually only necessary to exercise like this 2-4 times a week for around 30-minutes. People who run 1-hour+ a day are setting themselves up for hormonal and metabolic destruction, and the subsequent weight gain and fatigue, unless they have the rest of their lifestyle and nutrition seriously keyed in. Even then, they’re still going to die early. I’d lay off the colonics myself. There’s zero evidence to support their benefits, but more than enough detailing the side-effects and dangers, and they’re largely based on medical fantasy, e.g. faeces “stick” to your bowels for 20-years. One of the key factors in beating candida is restoring balance to the gut flora, and blasting it with water for an hour doesn’t please your microbial friends. The enthusiastic “I lost 10lbs and feel so refreshed” seems to too often become “I’m constipated and bloated and have booked another colonic” two weeks later. As for the cleanse, it’s good you’ve quit that because it won’t do anything to help your metabolism either. I’ve read bad things about how candida reacts to being sugar-starved, but I wish people would give references for such things. One potential reason you got recurrent thrush is because of the rice massively spiking your blood sugar after days in ketosis. Making sudden switches between diets is hard on the body, and ideally you’d reintroduce carbs slowly to tolerance. Settling in on a stable eating plan that includes enough calories, protein and ideally >50g/day of carbs, and covers the micronutrient spectrum is one of the best things you can do now. Most people here will discourage you from eating rice, which may or may not be good advice depending on how you handle starch, which depends on what’s going on in your mouth, stomach and small bowel. I’d say eat it at your own risk."
0,1111Andrea,284,"Hello,  I’ve been browsing this site for a few months now and it’s awesome. I am finally at a point where I can give up dairy and coffee in order to actually get well(even considering putting my whole family on a version of the diet). The first few times I visited the diet was readily available and now it’s not:( Here is my story: I was tired mostly of feeling tired and unable to lose weight. I did a ton of reading online and stumbled upon Candida information after cutting out wheat. It wasn’t until I was put on an antibiotic called Flagelle(sp)that I ended up with oral thrush myself(BOO!) While breastfeeding all three of my kids, we battled Thrush on and off and won or so i was led to believe. Though no one told me that it can linger with all of those other symptoms. I am guessing that considering I was a child with super sensitive skin and weird rashes, that I have probably had Candida overgrowth for my whole life and don’t want that for my own kids. I’m going to be starting the Molybdenum tonight(finally) and I’d like a copy of the diet and allowed foods so I can have everything ready to start. I am super excited to get healthy and feel well once again! Also, ready for the challenge of getting 6, 5 and 3 year olds to give up some of their favorite food. The help advice and information on this forum is awesome! Thank-you! 🙂"

2,Javizy,284,"I keep going on about this lately, but you should get your thyroid levels checked. Difficulty losing weight and fatigue probably rank in the top 3 of hypothyroid symptoms. Susceptibility to infections, including yeast ones, is another. Standard check-ups may include a check of your TSH level, but this is a pituitary hormone, and doesn’t reliably show thyroid function. If your T3 and T4 levels are in a good position within range along with good TSH, then you can probably rule it out. It’s quite a poorly diagnosed/treated condition, and as a result you might need to practically coerce your doctor into diagnosing your with it by learning about it yourself. I’d hope it’s not an issue, because it require lifelong medication, but that’s another reason to make sure it’s not an issue before getting your hopes up about improving your health naturally."

0,pixyshark,285,"Hello, I’m so glad this website has a forum section. I have been going through candida symptoms since February of this year and just recently was pointed in this direction. I believe that a candida overgrowth is definately contributing to the symptoms I am having. So I decided to start Stage 1 of the diet 5 days ago. It’s been going well (so thankful for the recipe’s section because things actually taste good) I had the confidence I could get through this, but then today, I got a really big scare. Around 4pm I started feeling dizzy. It came on really rapid, so rapid that I had about 10 seconds to get to a bed before I collapsed. I didn’t pass out, but I had the phone next to me about to dial out because I was so freaked out. It was almost like a panic attack, but without the heart racing feeling, just this nauseous dizzy spell. This happened three times within the hour and I decided it might be my sugar (I’m not diabetic, nor have I been diagnosed with high or low blood pressure, but seeing how I changed my diet very rapidly, the lack of sugar is the first thing that came to mind), so I drank half a can of coconut water and within 2-3 minutes I felt better. I want to make sure not to cause a repeat of what happened. I’ve been following the diet to a “T” and it kinda pissed me off having to drink the coconut water because even though it’s unsweetened, it still had a sugar count on the side. I’m not quite sure if having too low sugar was the problem or not, but does anyone have any suggestions on what I could do? Oh, also, when I felt dizzy, I got a sharp pain in my right side simultaneously. I read this could be the candida dying off, so even though it was just day 5, it could be that, but I really want to stick to this diet but I don’t want that dizzy-ing feeling again. I know fruit isn’t supposed to be added back to the diet until stage 2, but I’m wondering if I could add maybe some blueberries to my morning meal and see if that holds off the dizzy spells. If I shouldn’t add the fruit in, is there anything else I can try? Any input would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"
1,Able900,285,"Hello, welcome to the forum. Read the post titled “Die-off Dangers” posted on August 27. The pain in your side definitely sounds like one of many die-off symptoms. Try ¼ of a Granny Smith apple perhaps once or twice a day to see if that will take care of the dizziness, if not you could try the blueberries. Let us know how things go with the dizziness as well as any additional Candida reactions. Able"
2,pixyshark,285,"Hi Able, Thanks, I think I’m going to try the blueberries and see how they work (I’m not that big of a fan of apples). I also looked back in my food diary and I was maybe if anything getting at the most 800 calories per day, which is much lower than I want to be at (I prefer at least 1200). I’m not quite sure how I’m going to get that many calories in me, because protein and veggies don’t have that much to begin with, but I’m going to go to the grocery store and get more of a variety from the allowable food list and see what I can come up with. I think I definately was probably experiencing some of the die off symptoms. I’m planning on picking up a multi-vitamin as well tomorrow and seeing if maybe that will balance me out more a bit better as well. Hopefully I’ll have good news to report back!"
3,Able900,285,"Hello. If you read the die-off dangers post, you’ll see that two products are named which will reduce the die-off symptoms substantially; Molybdenum and Candidate by Native Remedies. Molybdenum can be taken up to three times a day and up to 250 mcg a dose. Candidate works more immediately and should be taken only when needed, meaning when you feel a die-off symptom starting. I wish you would let me know which multi-vitamin you choose before actually making the purchase. So many multi-vitamins contain additives which would have a negative effect on your Candida treatment as well as containing disproportional amounts of vitamins which would not be a benefit. As far as gaining your weight back or simply not losing more, this can be handled easier if you purchase something called organic coconut oil. This can prevent further weight loss and even help you to gain more if you choose to do so. Another item to prevent losing more weight is coconut flour bread; the recipe is in the forum under “Recipes.” By the way, the bread doesn’t taste like coconut, and you can eat the bread 3 to 4 times a day without problems as long as you’re not allergic to any of the ingredients such as eggs.

4,pixyshark,285,"The multi-vitamin I was thinking of buying is Centrum (just the regular kind, not the ultra or anything like that: http://www.centrum.com/OurProducts/Centrum.aspx) I usually take Intramax (you can see the ingredient list here: http://www.earthturns.com/intraMAX-Organic-Liquid-Vitamin-p/drl-max33.htm) but I’m on a budget this week so until I can get some more of that, I was thinking the Centrum is cheap and looks pretty well rounded. Do you see any ingredients in either of the products that might inhibit the candida to die off? I use the organic coconut oil right now probably once or twice a day to cook with. I’m overweight so losing too much weight isn’t really a concern as any bit off will help, I just mainly worry if my dizzyness I feel is because of a rapid change in how much sugars I usually eat. I read that cinnamon is suppose to help regulate blood sugar so I think I will pick me up some cinnamon tea too and see how that works. I’ll definately look for the coconut bread recipe on the forum too, thanks! 🙂"
5,Able900,285,"Hello. The IntraMAX Liquid Nutrition vitamin you don’t want to take because it contains the enzymes, Cellulase and Hemicellulase. Taking an individual enzyme, whether a few or several causes the body’s own production of these enzymes to shut down at which point your body will be completely dependent on you to provide artificial means of digesting all food from now on. That’s not what a person who is looking for good health wants. As far as the cellulase and hemicellulase are concerned, what these two enzymes do is break down into simple sugars the enzymes in the vegetables you eat. The resulting sugars will feed the surviving Candida. Using Grape Bitters is not the same as taking an enzyme directly, as it allows your body to produce its own digestive enzymes in the correct amounts and types that are needed. The main problem I have with the Centrum is the amount of Biotin it contains. Biotin is a significant B vitamin especially for a person with a Candida infestation as it can actually help to destroy the Candida. All of the other B vitamins in the vitamin contain 100% of the daily requirement, but Biotin only contains 10%. I have no idea why companies want to do this, but it’s a good way to get the ration of B vitamins in the human body out of balance if taken for a long period of time. Taking this for a short term would probably be alright, and you may want to purchase a Biotin supplement alone to add to the multiple. Once you start taking a good probiotic, it will take care of obtaining B vitamins. Able"
6,pixyshark,285,"Hi Able, Thank you for all the information. Yeah that’s quite interesting with Centrum as to why they would limit the Biotin amounts. I think I’ll take the Centrum for about three months and after that stop. By then hopefully I’ll be able to add in enough foods that will balance out my natural vitamin intake and I won’t have to take the supplements. Oh, I’ve also been taking a probiotic for probably I’d say three months now. I’ve seen people recommend other probiotics and even refrigerated ones, but this one has worked so well for alieving my symptoms that I don’t really want to change it. Can you tell me what you think about the probiotic? It wouldn’t have anything in it that would help the Candida would it? (that I think is what I’m most concerned about) It’s Pearls High Potency Probiotic. 5 billion CFU blend of Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Lactobaccilus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum. Other ingredients include: vegetable oil, gelatin, vegetable glycerin, pectin, soy lecithin (I’m assuming this all makes up the capsule). Would appreciate your opinion on this. Btw, where does your wealth of knowledge come from? Have you read most of it? I was in a nutrition class last year but we didn’t even touch on a good chunk of this stuff. I’d definately like to become more well rounded. Thanks!"

8,raster,285,"Able: is there a multi-vitamin that you can recommend for pixy? Pixy: I wouldn’t worry too much about the enzymes, because you do need some additional help to break down the foods in your body to get energy from them. But long term use could lead to the enzyme production problem he mentioned. Also all of the symptoms you have mentioned are normal.

I’ve yet to find one which contains the correct ratios of specific vitamins, but which usually contain unsafe so-called supplements such as certain enzymes which the human body doesn’t even produce. Taking such an unbalanced ratio of vitamins is not at all safe for the health of the human body when used on a regular basis. Able"

0,Loci,286,"Hello! I was just diagnosed last week with candida overgrowth in my gut. I could go into a whole sob story, but basically I did this to myself. Back in my late twenties due to horrible periods, I went on birth control pills. Another reaction from my periods was having 2-3 cystic pimples before my period and because i wanted flawless skin, I ended up taking antibiotics for years! After my first born turned one about 4 years ago, I noticed many of the symptoms associated with candida, but didn’t know what was wrong with me. I was diagnosed with anemia which then I found out was due to gluten sensitivity. So I gave up gluten, but still felt horrible. After the birth of my 2nd 20 months ago, I noticed the symptoms getting worse and worse…..the headaches, the anxiety, the extreme fatigue, the moodiness/impatience, the acne/hives, the dizziness/mental fogginess, the chronic diarrhea, oh the list goes on and on. I visited several doctors and no diagnosis. One actually thought I was hypoglycemic and tried to put me on metformin without even testing my fasting glucose, which in the end turned out to be fine and ended up being a lab error. When I mentioned yeast overgrowth, he was quick to tell me that westernized medicine doesn’t really believe in such a thing. In the end, I had to self diagnose and got it down to adrenal exhaustion, PMS disorder or candida overgrowth. Went to a great doc who did a full blood panel and absolutely everything cam back normal. I was frustrated and thought “could this all be in my head for the last 4 years?” But the tests just showed that all my hormone levels were normal and that yeast was a possibility. Fortunately, this doc was my gateway to a specialist who treats the yeast/gut connection. And sure enough, after testing, it came back positive for candida albicans. So I didn’t save you my sob story, but I feel so happy to be finally diagnosed. I have to admit, i have not done the detox, but I have started on a VERY strict diet (day 6 today) and I am on Nystatin. I have been having MAJOR yeast die off symptoms…..headaches, dizziness, irritability, etc. Sounds like it’s normal but hard to deal with. I will continue to research but does anyone have any good recommendations on a good cookbook? I miss sugar and diary and such, but I think giving up coffee has been the hardest!!!! Any advice for this newbie? It’s tough going through these withdrawls, especially being a mom to two young girls who need constant attention! Also I am going out to dinner tonight for my dad’s birthday. I want to cry as I have to watch everyone else eat their meals and drink their margs, while I sit by. :*( Feeling sorry for myself for sure….."

2,Loci,286,"Thank you so much for the information. This website has been my “go to” website right before and after diagnosis. My doc is a little more lenient on what I can eat, but I am being a lot more strict. Right now I mostly cook with Ghee, olive or coconut oil for my meals and use Stevia to sweeten. I am eating lots of eggs (which I am already accustomed to eating being gluten free for almost 3 years) for breakfast and made an ok pumpkin loaf per candida free cookbook. For lunch, right now I have a vat of soup I’ve been living off of with brown rice crackers (no salt). Dinner I am a little more inventive, but includes a lot of meats and veggies and quinoa so my family can eat it as well. My problem is snacking as I can tell that I am very light headed if I don’t eat every 2-3 hours. So far, I have just snacked on veggies. Yesterday I also bought Dandy coffee (chicory and dandelion root) to hold off my coffee cravings and it has worked ok so far. I also drink peppermint tea to soothe my stomach. As I mentioned, I bought a cookbook and I have also used some of your recipes! The cookbook calls for a lot of vegetable glycerin in baked goods and does not mention stevia as an alternative, but then again, it was written awhile back……. I just don’t feel satiated and I am going through the “poor me” phase. Everyone in my family going out to celebrate my dad’s birthday and I just sat there and gnawed on some corn chips and ate a plate of veggies, while everyone enjoyed their meals and margs. It’s hard. I thought it was hard to go gluten free having kids around and now I am gluten, dairy, sugar, coffee, alcohol, etc free and it’s all having to give it up at once and I still have a family to cook for. Of course, we’re already fairly healthy as is…..I only buy grass fed meats, buy minimally processed foods and such, but it’s the severe restrictions and the symptoms that go a long with this die off that is making it very difficult. I am looking forward to the day when I feel good again and then I know it will all be worth it. 🙂"
3,raster,286,"Hello Loci, We recommend a completely different foods list than what is on the main website because many people have had major setbacks eating foods they thought were anti-candida, when they turned out to be feeding candida. For instance, corn is very high in natural sugars…I hate to break it to you but its just not a good thing to eat while on the diet. Also, most corn is non-organic and contains GMO’s. It’s all about eating as little sugar as possible, and this is feeding the candida…maybe as much or more than rice. Corn is also inflammatory: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/breakfast-cereals/7283/2 Which brings me to the rice. It tastes good, has an OK nutrition profile, but it feeds candida as well…it contains high levels of starch. Thats why potatoes aren’t on the diet and rice shouldn’t be either. Most rice also is not organic. Rice is also inflammatory: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/breakfast-cereals/7705/2 Quinoa is also starchy, but inflammatory neutral: http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 Buckwheat on the other hand only contains 25% starch and is less inflammatory. Same texture as rice, tastes good, but is a prebiotic while corn and rice are not prebiotics. http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 Email able900 for our forums food list. -raster"
4,Loci,286,"Hi Raster, Thank you so much for all the information. Being gluten free, I did eat a lot of corn products, but I do know they are inflammatory so I cut back. If I do consume corn, I always buy GMO free products. I have been eating a lot of Quinoa for my sides loaded with parsley and eat only brown rice."

I have not cheated ONCE. I am proud of myself and the sugar cravings are not nearly has bad now that I am further along (the first week was the WORST). To curb my sweet tooth, I do the following: -1 cup plain greek yogurt – topped with coconut flakes and a little bit of xylitol (some use stevia but I don’t like the way it tastes and I had a reaction to it) -Make yourself some pumpkin or lemon cookies – yes, you can use brown rice flour or almond meal flour, add pecans, spices, etc and again, xylitol as a sweetner. Got these out of a candida free cookbook and made some changes and they still came out.  -I know this site is VERY strict about no fruit whatsoever. I have twice cut up a green apple, cooked it in coconut oil and added cinnamon and xylitol. Tasty treat. But be careful though. I personally did not have a reaction, as my doc said green apples are ok once in awhile. Just a few suggestions to help out."

0,mk3,287,"Hi everyone, (I apologize in advance for the long winded post) I am new here and only made my first post a couple days ago (should have probably posted here first). I am currently 24 years old and just became qualified as a High School teacher up here in Canada (Ottawa – the capital city). Very excited to start my new career in September…now to kill the “beast” (as my ND calls it) aka. Candida – so I can have my energy back and put in the utmost effort to enjoy the beginnings of this new stage of my life. Brief Health History I have quite the health history but will try not go into all the details. Had shingles twice as a child. Had Mono in my early teen years. Chronic strep throat (had tonsils taken out). Chronic sinus infections. Skin problems (acne, boils, cysts) the last 3-4 years (never really had acne through my teenage years). All of this means tons of antibiotics as a child and into my early twenties. December of 2010 – I saw an integrative medicine doctor who diagnosed me with leaky gut and noticed I was intolerant to gluten, eggs, dairy and almonds (through blood testing – checking for antibodies – IgE and IgG4). I followed his regimen and started feeling quite a bit better. October 2011 – I became VERY fatigued and would always be tired. I was not sleeping well and never felt refreshed even after 8-9 hours of sleep. My skin broke as bad as it ever has – I never had back or chest acne until now. Face was worse than ever. I was waking up 2-3 times a night with a strong urge to urinate. Al in all – just thought I needed to get my rest and get over whatever was causing this. Things got worse – I started to lose weight, felt depressed (unmotivated) and was becoming VERY constipated. Skin worsened and although I had a feeling that candida might be the issue I went on another 1 month cycle of minocin for my skin problems (mid January 2012). Blood work was all normal – so western doctors thought I was crazy! End of February 2012 – I self-diagnosed myself with Candida at this time (thank you internet and the help of a few friends pointing me in the right direction). I began by eliminating ALL processed sugars, vinegars, yeasts, molds and reducing my carb intake (in the form of grains). With all the conflicting info online I was not as strict as I probably should have been – hindsight is 20/20…all part of the journey! Early April 2012 – My symptoms had stagnated with some improving slightly but thought I should consult a professional. I saw a Naturopathic Doctor and she pretty much told me what I already knew. She had a very lenient view on the candida diet and I didn’t notice much of an improvement after first check-up with her after 1 month. She then had me start bentonite and caproyl. About 2 weeks after starting this phase with her I was referred to another ND (by my dentist ironically). I was hesitant to see someone else and perhaps confuse me even more. Well I decided to give her a shot. Early June 2012 – See the 2nd ND and she is a lot more strict in terms of diet (no fruit, no red meat or pork, 1 small portion of grains every 2 days etc.). She uses “applied kinesiology” to see what my issues were and what supplements/herbs would help me. She noticed that I most definitely had candida, adrenal fatigue, kidney issues Current Symptoms – weight loss (20 lbs below my ideal weight) – I’m not a big guy to begin with – skin breakouts (definitely better than back in January – swelling and painful boils/cysts are pretty much gone…still deal with some acne/redness and dry skin on face, back, chest and hands) – fatigue (although MUCH better than it was back in January 2012) – kidney/bladder issues – still have urgency problems – urinating 12-15 times/day – I do drink a TON of water but still peeing too much – digestion/elimination (again MUCH better than before but still not ideal – some stools tend to be quite hard or insufficient in terms of size; also gassy at times) – ammonia/weird smell in nose (has improved but still present – ND has me taking baking soda before bed to help reduce acidity and balance out pH levels) – dandruff/smelly scalp and slight loss of hair (thinning) – this has remained fairly constant although I no longer have any sores left on my scalp – tense/anxious feelings at times – for absolutely no reason even when I’m not nervous or anxious about anything Current Diet (last 6 weeks) Protein Digestive aid taken with all meals: Protein Digestive Aid Probiotic – 1 before breakfast and 1 before dinner, brand: Metagenics Sip on chlorophyll in water throughout the day Drink 2.5-3 litres of water/day Breakfast – glass of water with 2 tsp of Silvergard solution – fiber mix (1 tsp) and bentonite (1 tsp) – 25 minuted before I eat – 2-3 organic eggs – wheat-free oatmeal (every 2nd day) w/ unsweetened hemp milk and coconut milk, cinnamon and hemp hearts – yeast/sugar/gluten free Soda Bread w/ coconut butter as spread – supplements/herbs: Vitamin B Complex Adrenal Support KB-C RE-X Caprylic Acid magnesium citrate capsule Lunch – protein (chicken/turkey) – vegetables (steamed/grilled to help with digestion) – supplements/herbs: same as breakfast except no RE-X Dinner – fiber mix (1 tsp) and bentonite (1 tsp) – 25 minuted before I eat – large salad (cucumber, green peppers, onion and avocado) w/ home-made dressing (olive oil, squeezed lemon juice, herbs, salt, pepper) – protein (chicken/turkey) – vegetables (steamed/grilled to help with digestion) – very small amount of grain (brown rice or quinoa) (1-2/week)  – supplements/herbs: adrenal support KB-C Snacks (morning/afternoon/evening) – 1 or 2 of the following: – coconut bread (recipe from this website!) – home-made hummus with rice crackers (although stopping with rice crackers for now as I think they were causing me to become gassy) – brown rice cake with almond butter – home-made pickled cucumbers/cabbage (made with celtic salt and water to create brine) – home-made lentil soup – apple or berries (VERY rarely (1-2 times/week) – ND told me re-introduce them slowly but I am still weary) supplements/herbs (before bed): – 2 Calcium Tablets – 2 RE-X – 1 tsp of Magnesium powder in water – 1 tsp of baking soda in water All cooking is done with olive oil but mostly coconut oil Use quite a bit of celtic and pink sea salt in my foods – suppose to help me retain liquids better Recommendations The internet can be a blessing but also a curse because I read WAY too much and there is so much conflicting information about candida and related diets…therefore I tend to overwhelm myself and second guess my regimen. So I ask for recommendations with caution – if Raster or Able could chime in with perhaps some comments on my symptoms and corresponding diet that would be much appreciated. Also – Able could you send me the “strict diet”?… as I would like to compare it to my current diet. It has been difficult at times because I don’t seem to react acutely to any foods so I generally gauge the “safety” of certain foods in my diet by how my skin reacts in the subsequent days. However, I have been told over and over that my skin is breaking out because of the elimination of toxins (die-off) so it could in fact be a good thing that my skin is breaking out and therefore not necessarily something I ate….confusing to say the least. Overall I feel like I am on the right track finally and it’s nice to have a wonderful resource like this site. As selfish as it sounds…it’s nice to know others are facing similar struggles – for a while I (and the western doctors) thought I was crazy and saw very little hope. It’s also comforting to know God is working this out for my good (although I may not even know what He is trying to show through this trial) – Rom. 8:28 – “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”"
1,mk3,287,So I have been noticing a distinct smell to my stools lately. I am not even sure what it smells like – almost like burnt rubber. It is very strong smelling. There also seems to be a stringy/elastic subtance in my stools as well. Common? Candida-related? If this has been addressed in another thread please provide a link. Thanks
2,mk3,287,Well I guess I’ll keep posting questions until I get a response 🙂 Does anyone know of a Canadian retailer that sells Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate? I really don’t want to order from the UK and have it take 2 weeks to get to me. I know milk thistle is more readily available in Canada. Anything in the ingredients that I should be looking for? certain brands better than others? Thanks
3,raster,287,"Hello Mk3, The only thing I would change is what you eat. For instance, rice is very starchy like potatoes (which are not on diet) and contain low amounts of sugar…I would remove these and replace with buckwheat(only 25% starch) as an alternative. I noticed I progressed a ton more when I cut out all rice products. I love the rice cakes too, but just not good enough for the strict diet. Same with almond butter. I would save both of these items until your leaky gut is mostly healed. Is it fresh almond butter? Almond butter is rather high in mold and can set you back some. I was highly allergic to it early on. There are a ton more vitamins and supplements we can recommend such as SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne. The list can be very long.

Those are the sources I’m sure of, so I can’t recommend others if I don’t know they’re safe for the treatment. If you have one in mind, send me a link to the details and I’ll check it out. Able"
0,Rachel_Healing,288,"I finally decided to do the detox now that I am at a place with work where I can afford to be “down” for 10 days. I am only on day 2, but I’m wondering if anyone has experienced a worsening in tongue coat or a yeast infection early into the cleanse? Is this normal? Also, is carbonated water okay? Stevia? I’m doing the “easier” detox.  Any personal stories about tongue coat or yeast infection would be appreciated!"
1,HumbleGeorge,288,"I think this is very normal yes. Remember you are irritating the the yeast overgrowth, this means it is working. Unfortunately things gets allot worse before it gets better. Just don’t quit. It is very important to get rid of the sugar intake even fruits. Also introduce coconut oil into your diet it has been proven that coconut oil is as effective as chemical candida controlling medicine. Good luck!"
2,flailingWcandi,288,Heard carbonation isn’t good.
3,Rachel_Healing,288,"Thanks for the encouragement George. This cleanse is brutal. I have brain fog, feel spacey, aching sides, numb limbs, ringing in the ears. I have been eating seaweed, salad. Everything off the list, coconut oil, Pau de Arco. You name it. I was planning for 10 days. Let’s see if I can make it! I am craving all the good stuff: cheeseburgers, cake, whiskey, pizza, cupcakes."
4,Javizy,288,"The theory I heard was that since candida can metabolise ketones, ketosis can actually exasperate yeast infections. You’re also likely to experience a drop in immunity and metabolism during a cleanse. Die-off should involve symptoms of toxicity rather than raging thrush or something. Another thing I’ve heard from multiple sources is that it becomes more pathogenic when deprived of glucose, but I don’t know where the evidence is (hearsay sucks). I’m not sure what evidence the cleanse itself is based on and whether it outweighs the effects on metabolism. If you’re feeling so awful, you might want to start with the normal diet. Abrupt changes in diet aren’t without risks, and many of your symptoms could be unrelated to candida. You might want to go easy on the seaweed if you’re eating a lot too. It’s high in iodine which, could potentially cause symptoms if you’re deficient or if the levels go too high."
0,indio,289,"Hello every one 🙂 Thought I would introduce myself, give a bit of background info and in return get some support from this wonderful forum. Sorry it’s a long one!! I am 25, I have known about Candida for 7 years. When I was 18 I was SO fed up with feeling ill all the time I went to see a nutritionist. I’d been misdiagnosed in hospital at 17 and because they wanted the bed the booted me out with 4 YES 4 different anti-b’s. Well, as you can imagine, in pain and scared, I listened to what the “Dr” commanded. When the test results came back . . . they were all clear, I’d taken all those pills for NO reason other then to tick some ones boxes (thanks NHS. So as you can imagine it made me ill, very ill. I was told I had IBS as a result of taking them. I lost part of my eyesight, my weight plummeted, my skin was grey, I was tired, slept all the time, couldn’t eat, black eyes, the works. I had to quit college because I couldn’t physically do anything. It was depressing and lonely and no one understood how I felt. It took a year to get to a point where I could actually work. So at the nutritionist, I told her what happened, went through my lifes medical history and she told me I have Candida. 6 years ago in the UK, this wasn’t a well known thing and finding info was a nightmare. People looked at me as if I was making it up. But I did what I could. 3 months of a strict Candida diet and it made the world of difference. But since then, life has happened, diet no longer a priority, got married, moved house etc etc etc. I kept a few habbits from the diet, like no sugar added to drinks, no alcohol (I don’t see the point in it). However, The time has come to do it again and this time with more knowledge, options and support with the help of this website.  My diet isn’t horrendous. I am about 16 pounds over weight, a UK size 12. I have a lot of problems with my circulation in my legs, they ache all the time and I have varicose veins which hurt and throb. I also have stage 4 cellulite on my thighs. I have a perfectly toned and slim top half, my arms are amazing and my waist and tummy are perfect. But my legs are a different matter. They are FULL of water, I can’t get jeans on and the cellulite is making my skin sag. I am like two halves of different people. I have read that an under functioning liver contributes to cellulite.  I am also tired all the time, I CRAVE sugar like nothing else and my IBS ranges from green poop one day to nothing at all for 3 days. I do yoga, weight training and work out on elliptical training machine 3 times a week. I have been weaning myself off foods this last few weeks. No bread for the last 8 day’s, hot water and lemon with ginger instead of tea, 2 litres of water a day, lot’s of fruit instead of cake, I never eat anything with added salt (I balloon with water) I have cuts loads out and lost 3 pounds in a week. My husband is working abroad and will be home in September – If I don’t do this now, I never will. I want to be fit and healthy for when he comes home and not be the tired, bloated misery I am now. So enough is enough, I work from home and as of next Monday, I am on the Candida Diet.(Got a big meal with friends in a couple of day’s to get out the way). This website has a wealth of information and I am sure you will be hearing from me with nagging questions 😉 I scored 16 on the Candida Diet Test .. . So Wish me luck!! By the way, if anyone has gone through the diet and seen a reduction in water retention, I would love to hear from you."
1,Latka,289,"just make sure you don’t go too low on the calories while on the diet. I did that and more water retention resulted. Though I must say the first two weeks on the diet I noticed a significant lessening of water retention. However here I am now even more bloated and not getting my jeans on. Trying to figure out what to do about it. Also have my suspicion that a struggling liver might have somthing to do with it. Just a thought: I’ve also read that overhydration and not enough salt can cause water retention too (!). I think it is a matter of finding a balance and not overdoing anything. I did a lot of colonics in the begining which means that I lost a lot of electrolytes. On top of that I was taking saunas and sweating a lot, and then drinking lots of water just flushing my system even more. I wonder if my water retention might actually have somehting to do with not having enough salt?"
0,jkennedy,290,"hello! after many years of rollercoaster-like health & many many doctor visits/specialists/naturopaths/alternative medicine methods, i think i’ve found what it is that is making me sick. just a little background information: at 10, i experienced intense stress which caused me to become anorexic for 2 years which led to having a sensitive stomach. at 19, i experienced my first full blown anxiety attack & continue to deal with it. at 23, had my first episode of UTI followed by an antibiotic treatment only to find out a few months later that i had HPV. thankfully, that has cleared. at 27-29, i underwent another intense period of stress which led to extreme indigestion, fatigue. at 30, along with these symptoms, i began to experience symptoms of extreme pain before my monthly and during the first few days not being able to have a bowel movement without feeling like passing out due to the pain. i recently was diagnosed by my OB-GYN to most likely have endometriosis. continued, i started having bladder issues of not being able to fully release when i use the restroom. this either caused or was caused by a bladder infection that was treated with antibiotics, but continued to reemerge monthly and underwent another round of antibiotics along with a homeopathic remedy because i couldn’t take antibiotics anymore. while trying to figure out what was happening with my bladder, last november, i suddenly had a 3 day episode of dizziness/spinning which was diagnosed as HPPV and had MRI scans, ear/nose testing, neurological testings done. no doctor has been able to pinpoint what the cause was and i have been left with a diagnosis of stress & migrane. even with the migrane, the doctor was honest in saying that he was not 100% sure if that was even what was happening. i am left with no other options in western medicine as all doctors/specialists have told me that it is a mystery. now i am left with brain fog coupled with head tension/head ache and have not been able to full function or drive for the past 8 months. i have been seeing a chiropractor, physical therapist for motion/balance, acupuncturist and although the symptoms are not as bad, it seems to be plateauing. the brain fog is consistently there as if it never quite wakes up from the morning and i am constantly tired because of trying to work through the fog. i was diagnosed with gluten sensitivity about 6 months ago and have been on a gluten free diet and although my energy has been better (before i would have to pass out for 2-3 hours a day due to extreme fatigue), but still, the other symptoms are not getting better. when i have diarrhea episodes, my stomach hurts like no other and afterwards, i am wiped out of all energy and have to pass out because i can’t stay awake. it’s a draining experience. i am sensitive to foods, but do not know which foods i’m actually sensitive to as it seems to change depending on my body and how it is feeling. i can’t take tobacco smell as it makes my heart palpitate, cannot have caffeine or alcohol for the same reason. i’ve been feeling like all this is due to stress and have been seeing a therapist for it, but somewhere inside me i felt like there must be more to the puzzle piece. also, i sudden began having rashes on my hands 2 years ago out of no where and was prescribed a topic ointment to clear it up, but it continues to flare up here and there. not entirely sure why. during my many doctor visits, i saw 2 naturopaths who ran tests and said that looking at the results they suspect i have candida/yeast overgrowth, but when i took it to my western medicine doctor, he dismissed the tests saying that there was to scientific evidence to back up the tests so i never really looked into it. now that i am at a dead end in terms of western medicine (again), and not being able to function, i am willing to try anything to try and figure out what’s going on. i took the candida test today and it came back saying that yeast connected health problems are probably present. this is all so new to me and being already on a very restricted gluten free diet & reading about the die off, i’m afraid of trying this without knowing exactly how to proceed. i’m very sensitive with any medications and have not been successful at even taking different probiotics, multivitamins, and supplements. even some teas make me feel sick. i would definitely appreciate any feedback/thoughts that anyone might have in regards to what i should do to start off? if i might have something else instead? if i do have candida, what to expect and how to go about it naturally and safely? i’m just so lost…. but i can’t continue living life holed up at home and not being able to function… i want to get better and live a healthy like i once did… thank you."
1,Able900,290,"Hello, J, welcome to the forum.– If I cannot find molybdenum, do I really need to get molybdenum or can I do without it? is there a substitute for this? Yes you need it, otherwise you’ll likely be very ill. Where do you live? I’ll try to help you find it.– If the Swedish bitters liquid form and the milk thistle liquid form has alcohol (4% alcohol), are they okay to use? You should take milk thistle in powder form which can be found in capsules. Swedish bitters should be used as a liquid and can be found in the alcohol-free form. This is why only “Swedish” bitters are named and not other brands.-Is it okay to just use one enzyme (either the milk thistle or swedish digestive bitters) while on the cleanse? Neither of these are enzymes. Milk thistle is an herb used to protect and heal the liver because of the die-off as well as the living Candida toxins, and digestive bitters is used to stimulate the production of natural enzymes and to flush the liver of toxins, but they are not enzymes. Would this have any adverse effects on my body if i chose to just use one enzyme while on the cleanse? You’ll receive all the beneficial natural enzymes and at the same time avoid synthetic enzymes by using the digestive bitters. You should use this throughout the entire treatment, not just during the cleanse. Again, if you intend to take only one of these, take the Swedish Digestive Bitters.-On the site, I read about the Swedish digestive bitters: ‘No matter what you read from here on out, you will not need to purchase additional enzymes as long as you use the Bitters.’ Does this mean that all I need is the Swedish digestive bitters (no need for the molybdenum or the milk thistle)? No, that’s not what I typed. Each of these does specific jobs in specific ways. Leave out the milk thistle if you have to avoid one.-How many times a day (and when/which time) should I drink the daily detox drink? Up to three if possible.-How many times a day should I drink the liver flush drink? Two or three if possible. Keep in mind that once is better than none.-Is there a difference between sodium bentonite clay powder and calcium bentonite powder?Yes, and you should use sodium-bentonite powder as stated on our cleanse page.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst997_Proper-and-Safe-Cleanse.aspxIs the sodium bentonite powder also known as the swelling bentonite powder Yes, because it covers a larger area and absorbs quicker and better.I would greatly appreciate any suggestions, advice, or comments anyone may have. My only suggestion is to read the protocol and the links it contains even if you’ve already done so. The link is shown below in my signature area. Able"
2,raster,290,"I would do the enzymes only after the cleanse if you do choose to take them. Remember the cleanse only should last about a week at the longest; feel free to start the diet and not do the cleanse whenever you are ready. Expect a long term recovery time frame to repair the gut, heal the organs, and to get over this beast. The cleanse won’t even come close to killing off all of the candida if you do have it. If you feel worse on the diet and cleanse, and get “flu-like” symptoms…you likely have a gut flora overgrowth or imbalance and the first part is typically hard. After about a few weeks to a month or so depending on how you progress, you should start to get over “die-off” symptoms and start to heal. Everyone heals at different rates, but you typically feel worse before you feel better. Your body and candida are likely addicted to sugars, so it could be a hard adjustment. -raster"
0,Kamilion,291,"Let me start off by saying thank you for reading an insight to my story with Candida. I’m a 20 yr old male from Hamilton Ontario and I have been struggling with accepting the fact that I have Candida and have to treat myself via dieting and supplementing for well over 3 years. The last 2 of the 3 years it had progressed to a severe case involving psoriasis, and crohns disease mainly due to a whole list of medications prescribed to me that aggravated my Candida (Anti-biotics, Losec, steroids to name a few) my past diet, my past partner which had Candida symptoms all over and lastly excessive use of OTC fungal medications and a few prescription fungal medications without being on the Candida diet! Sounds like the perfect Candida Storm to say the least. This weakened my immune system to the point where Candida literally consumed all of my energy and almost all my hope. I’m on a strict diet with the help of this amazing book. I’m feeling a lot better but I still have a long way to go. It seriously changed my life and it’s only been following this books guidlines on diet, stress and overall well being! I thought I knew what a good Candida Diet was but I wasn’t progressing, this book changed my life and prepared me to finally kill this Candida. http://www.amazon.ca/Com…d-Edition/dp/0761527400 It includes a Candida diet that is renown by many doctors. You can eat like a king or queen on this diet! The fact that you’ll enjoy this diet will help your body heal faster! It also contains ways to cope with stress, supplements, loads of recipes and expert advice on everything there is to do with Candida! I want to spread the word because I know how horrible dealing with Candida is. Please leave any comments and suggestions!"
1,Able900,291,"Kamilion wrote: You can eat like a king or queen on this diet! With that fact, I have to know what the foods are on this royal diet. Would you care to share which foods from the diet are suitable for kings and queens? Thanks, Able"
2,Kamilion,291,"Absolutely! I won’t be able to provide a list as in-depth as the author has, but it will be adequate enough to get you started. She outlined 4 different phases of Candida diets, which depend on the severity of your Candida, and post-candida diets. I’m currently on Phase 2 which is recommended for moderate-severe cases. Outlined are foods to enjoy, that I personally highlighted and enjoy out of her comprehensive list of Foods to Enjoy phase 2: Almonds, Amaranth flour, Artichoke hearts, Asparagus, Avodcados,  Beets, Brocolli, Brussel spouts, Cabbage, Carrots, Cayenne pepper,  Celery, Chickpeas, Chickpea flour, Cranberry juice (unsweetened),  Cucumbers, Eggs, Fish: Salmon, Tuna, Cod, Trout and other ocean variety (cooked only),  Flaxseeds, Garlic, Kale, Kasha (toasted buckwheat)- one of my favourite sources of carbohydrates,  Lemon juice, Lettuce (leaf, red, bibb, and Boston only), Lime juice, Millet,  Oil (Olive- extra virgin, Coconut, Sunflower, canola, flax, pumpking cold-pressed only),  Onions (white, yellow or red), Paprika, Parsley, Peppers (bell), Quinoa, Radishes, Snow peas, Squash, Tofu, Tomatoes, Turnips, Yams, Zucchini The list I provided is a small portion of the list provided in the book. With each phase there is also a section titled Occasional Foods to Enjoy which is up to and/or your naturopath. Approval with a naturopath is recommended. Some of my favourite examples are: Chicken, Lamb, Veal -organic, free-range preferred, Ricotta cheese, Sauerkraut, Stevia, Feta Cheese, Berries-cooked only I did not do this author justice by any means, the book is WAY more comprehensive. I’m sure you have spent a lot of money trying to beat Candida. This book has helped me more than prescription meds, supplementing and dieting on my own has AFTER doing my own research on the internet, and seeing my naturopath over the course of 2-3 years! Personally there is no monetary on my health, but this book cost me about $20! I highly recommend it."

5,BlueSkies,291,"Kamilion, Not everyone can eat foods on that list. Cranberry juice? Really? You might as well get me to eat a chocolate cake. 🙂 Sadly, I’m a person who has a more reactive system and I need to keep my food list very basic and highly alkaline. I’m glad that it worked for you though. Jealous in fact."
6,Kamilion,291,"Yes cranberry juice! I’m not talking about ocean spray or any mass-produced brand name cranberry cocktails loaded with added sugar. The one I drink is lifesource uti formula with echinacea, marshmallow and dandelion. I can’t find the label for it otherwise I would post it. Like I said that list doesn’t imply to everyone, the book is a guideline to curing Candida not a procedure. It has no sugar added, as I suffer from low stomach acidity this cranberry juice (mixed with water, it is too sour to drink alone) greatly aids in my digestion, however I drink it apart from my meals. I take betaine hcl and Megafood megazymes digestive enzymes http://www.vitacost.com/megafood-dailyfoods-megazymes which also contains ginger, astragalus, marsmallow and probiotics with my meals to aid with the digestion process."
7,Kamilion,291,"A key point I would like to add is there are a few food combining principles that I have learned from my own research my naturopath and Complete Candida Yeast Guidebook, Revised 2nd Edition: Everything You Need to Know About Prevention, Treatment & Diet that are key to the healing process (at least it has been for me). I will name a few that I follow. Eat protein-digested foods seperately from carbohydrate-digested foods or starchy foods. Following this rule helps to speed digestion and healing and keeps one from absorbing as many calories from foods. Meats may be eaten with vegetables (as long as they are less starchy) Eat meat before salad. Avoid drinking liquids with meals. An sip here and there is ok. The book also provides a comprehensive Food Combining Chart, listing what foods to be combined with others for best results."

Considering I was diagnosed with crohns and later diagnosed with psoriasis last year after prolonged use of doctor prescribed antibiotics, ulcer medications, topical steroids, anti-depressants and sleeping pills to name a few.. prior to my knowledge of Candida, to “treat” my symptoms. This in turn fed my Candida and made everything even worse. So YES I would consider myself somewhere in-between moderate and severe. I consider that to be my starting diet, because I have attempted Candida diets in the past with little to no success."
11,Able900,291,"Kamilion wrote: That was a typo, What I meant to say was moderate to severe. I consider that to be my starting diet."
12,Kamilion,291,"I thank you for your opinion, like I said Candida affects everyone differently, and this works great for me :). I have Candida die-off symptoms from my diet alone which has been an achievement for me after trying many anti-fungals without sticking to a good diet plan in the past. Yes Amaranth contains starch. I rotate what I eat, so the recipe I use for organic amaranth flour made pancakes I eat about 1-2 times a week and it does not hinder my progress. The only other grains I do eat is Quinoa and Buckwheat(Kasha). Steamed or boiled carrots, though starchy are also very beneficial for digestive health. They are loaded with vitamin A, beta-carotene which is a powerful anti-oxidant. Raw carrots are difficult to break down with Candida, it’s eating them in moderation and how you prepare them. Some individuals have some level of constipation with Candida. Beet and carrot juice 1:1 ratio is a great way to lessen that symptom! Snow peas I eat cooked only, and like I said I do not eat my protein digested foods with my carbohydrate digested foods to ensure better digestion. The cranberry juice I’m referring to can only be purchased at health food stores. I drink it about 3-4 times a week with water and even some lemon juice on an empty stomach, usually in the morning about 30 minutes before breakfast. It might not work so well for you (thought I doubt you have tried the kind I am referring to) but it works great for me. Able, some people do not tolerate certain foods with Candida, whether they are Anti-Candida or not. A good test to have done is a food allergy test (ELISA/ACT). http://www.elisaact.com/test/nonhc/clinical-successes.asp The shortened list I provided you with is an anti-candida diet that I follow, with the help of my Naturopath. I also get all my supplements and groceries at the local Health Food Store Goodness Me! Again that’s just me. If you enjoy the flavour of food, you salivate more and therefore release more digestive enzymes. It’s an erroneous belief that you have to sacrifice and suffer to feel well. I actually enjoy cooking something that makes me feel better, and I believe that’s what has made me progress to better health more quickly. I’m just sharing my experiences because I know how awful it is trying to figure out what you can and can’t eat, and I find I’m quite passionate about it. I like to share my experiences and learn those of others too. This works for my unique case of Candida, and everyone’s on here to find out what works for their own unique case. And now may I ask, do you have your Candida under control Able? Or have you gotten rid of it altogether? And if so please share."

However, searches never offer more than this, so these 20 pages go back only about 3 weeks, so they won’t include my entire story.

Have the 30 grams of sugar in every 8 ounces been miraculously removed? Because that’s the problem with the juice; the sugar is food for Candida and allows it to survive.

14,raster,291,"You can find benefits to your health with a simpler diet; I’ve been on stage one for about 9 months…and it can take as long as 6-18 months to fully get over candida overgrowth. Going to stage 2 too early can set back your progress and its basically something you should start when you are completely over die-off symptoms and are symptom free. For some people this takes a long time, but if it only took you a few weeks before starting stage 2, then you likely don’t have a severe overgrowth. You might not notice any symptoms when you eat these items, but what you should really pay attention to is how well you are healing and progressing forwards. I don’t eat much starch at all even after a year on the diet and its all about finding the right balance in your diet. -raster"

Here’s a great bread to try out if you want to gain weight: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst3751_Rasters-coconutteffbuckwheatalmond-flour-bread.aspx Teff has great weight gaining properties.

Candida sensitivities do not develop until leaky gut syndrome causes the food to pass direction into the blood stream from the intestines which are permeated by the Candida cells. Therefore, the more foods you eat, the more foods your going to acquire an allergy to. You should stick to foods that are on the strict diet only. Have you requested the strict diet? If you don’t have it and are interested, I can send it to you. It’s the diet that most of the members are using as well as the experts who are still on the treatment. Able"

I’ve been taking l-glutamine (amino acids) 1/2 hour before foods and digestive enzymes with foods, which has helped the foggy/fuzzy head I get. Thank you again Heather."

0,jennd121,293,"Hello all! I am so excited to have stumbled upon this website again after so many years!  I have been suffering for almost 4 years from Candida, only having been diagnosed recently. I visited 9 doctors for them all to tell me it was in my head. The last doctor was a food allergist who diagnosed me with Candida. He put me on “the diet” and Nystatin for a bit, when that didn’t work, he tried me on the diflucan, which also didn’t work. He said there are allergy shots for Candida, which at this point I am not willing to commit the time and money involved. I have been married for nearly 2 years, and our baby just turned one, so I have other things to be doing and spending my money on. He couldn’t assure me the shots would work, so I am not willing to take more time and money away from my family for me to not get better. I just finished a “full body cleanse” which is supposed to kill parasites, and am now trying 2 new things, one to clear heavy metal poisoning and one to kill metals and candida. I am just at the begining, but I’ll let you all know how it goes. I have been very strict on my candida diet since January, with no light at the end of the tunnel thus far. I am hoping this new plan will at least give me a flicker. I need a little bit of hope to keep me doing this.  It is great to have found this website and know that I am not alone in my journey, and like so many others, I am really just starting it."

For how long ?? Fluconazole can not work because it is a systemic drug ( go to the blood ) Candida head quarter is in the colon. These candida colonies have an incredible immune suppression power. You MUST attack the head quarter, when the colonies begin to die and go out, your immune system will begin to recover. Then, it is possible to treat any other part of the body infected with candida such as vagina, mouth, etc. Your symptoms will subside when the amount of toxins these colonies living in the colon be destroyed. They are able to put in your bloodstream a huge load of toxins that interfere with your brain, vision, endocrine system, etc. It is as simple as this. Jorge."
0,Determined,294,"Finished Week 1. So I finished my first week of the cleanse. I had originally planned on stopping the cleanse at this point and moving to the strict diet, but since pay day comes every two weeks, I figured I may as well push through and go the whole 14 days with the cleanse. I figured it couldn’t hurt. Here’s the rundown of how it’s been going so far: Day 1: Morning. This was the first day in many years I didn’t have my morning coffee and it was surprisingly not so bad. I mixed up my detox drink with psyllium husk powder and bentonite clay. Holy crap was that thing thick! I only had the psyllium husk powder and didn’t realize it expanded 50 times it’s size. Being the consistency of oatmeal, I literally gagged it down, dry-heaving the entire time. I’m thinking to myself, I have to do this how many more times? Almost immediately after, I had a bm, which was no doubt pushing out all of the crappy food I ate the day before. Fresh start.  That’s good, I guess. I drank more water. I continued to drink water. Around noon I made myself a salad with lettuce, zucchini slices, spinach, avocado, and olive oil and lemon and garlic dressing. It was satisfying. I wasn’t that hungry, but really not all that surprising due to the fact I usually don’t even eat anything substantial until around 4pm. I also had water. Kept drinking water. So far I was feeling a little more fatigued, but that didn’t seem unusual for me. I’m always fatigued. 4pm. Time for the next detox drink. How am I going to do this? I mixed up the bentonite clay in a tall glass. Had a second glass of water on hand. Forgive me if this is a bad thing to do, but I just put half of the dry psyllium husk powder in my mouth and quickly chugged it down with the liquid (kind of like you would with a pill), then the other half and rinse and repeat. Then follow it up with more water. Sorry, but that is the only way I could do it. Then more water. I started planning on what to prepare for dinner, when the headache started. I lay down on the couch to see if it would get better. Had to lay there awhile. The headache kept getting worse. I realized at that point I’d forgotten to take the milk thistle I had. I took 400mg at that point. Headache continued. I decided to go lay down in my bed. Halfway to my room I had to make a pit stop to the bathroom for a projectile vomit fest. That was fun. I drank more water. After those festivities, I went to my room and laid down and fell asleep for a couple hours. I got up feeling a little better. Headache wasn’t as bad. I went out and made myself some cauliflower soup. I could barely eat any. I drank more water. Took more milk thistle and went to bed. I was just feeling way too sick to even try to choke down the liver flush drink. Yeah, probably not a good thing, but there was always tomorrow. Day 2: Started out with a big glass of water. Took some milk thistle. Detox drink (same cheating trick as I did before). Not hungry at all. Ate some leftover soup from the night before. First half of the day okay, just like yesterday. Second detox drink. Again, start feeling worse. I don’t know what it is with the second half of the day, but that seems to be when the die off symptoms are at their worst. Luckily, no vomiting. Still developed a headache. And to add to that this time it was horrible aches around the hip area. Drank more water. Had dinner. Green beans, cauliflower and mustard greens. Couldn’t eat much. Still not hungry. Drank water. Took some more milk thistle. Drank more water. Still no bm this day. Concerned I may have been constipated. Took a nice long hot Epsom salt bath and felt so good, I realized this needed to be done every night. Before bed, I remembered to make the liver flush drink. It wasn’t so bad! Actually 100 times better to stomach than the detox drink. I went to bed, but I couldn’t get comfortable with these aches. I tossed and turned all night. Days 3 – 7: Much the same as the second day, but including a bm, thank goodness. Every day the aches get a little better. Days 4 – 7 no headache at all. Still fatigued, but all in all it’s not been so bad. I am now starting day 8. The aches in the hip area from the night before is gone this morning. My shoulders (which always felt sore, as from overuse of the joints and muscles) are actually feeling worse when I wake up now. I’m sure the hip aches will start up this afternoon, but last night wasn’t too bad at all. The aches seem to be getting better and better. I’m also having regular bm’s. They’re not the greatest. But at least I’m urinating like it’s no tomorrow. I probably won’t have much more to update until I began the strict diet and antifungals."

I really wouldn’t be sad if I did. The only hold back is that payday isn’t until this coming Thursday, so I won’t be able to go out and get anything else. Would it be a bad thing to just continue with the veggie diet and detox drinks without the fiber until then? I’d hate to think that because I got the wrong fiber to begin with, that I’d need to start over with the cleanse again. And I am very interested in knowing more about the strict forum foods.

0,Landy360,295,"I am a 21 year old male and I’ve had candida for what i believe to be 2 years now. I first noticed it when i would go out for a long night of drinking, I would feel extra terrible the next day and sometimes 2 days after. Eventually it got to the point where I would have this “hangover”, 24/7. It took my until march of this year to finally figure out what i had. I had been to various doctors and explained my symptoms to them and they all thought i was crazy or diagnosed me with depression or something that i know i didn’t have. I felt insane! I also had a history of going to raves and taking drugs such as ecstasy and cocaine in large amounts and also drinking heavily. So at first i thought, Oh shit! I screwed up my liver or something and its permanent. I didn’t know what else to do until my mom recommended me to a naturopath. She then diagnosed me with candida. She also set me up with a diet and these supplements -ground flax seed, molybdenum, therelac probiotic, gastrigest, glutamine, cod liver oil, and maybe one more thing, i can’t remember. But after a week or so i thought i was starting to feel beter. Then i was experiencing all the same symptoms just as bad. I had to quit my job at the fiberglass plant cause i could tell that was making things much worse. Anyways, bottom line here, I have had this candida for a while now and i feel maybe slightly better but its still there definitely. I was looking for some advice from a pro maybe. I have also tried drinking again to see if i still got that nasty hangover and yes it was still there. The thing i mostly notice form my candida is brainfog and i have bags under my eyes that won’t go away. Thanks for any help guys or for reading my story. I hope we can all get cured someday."

3,Mike853,295,"I might think the biggest culprit was your job at the fiberglass plant. I have a terrible reaction to fiberglass and I think it makes candida worse. I struggled with it for years, and it managed me rather than me managing it. I have done a lot of research on fiberglass and its affect on health. As a substance on its own, fungus and mold happily make it a home. It is a powerful irritant and is destructive to living tissue. I believe that it sets some people up for fungal or yeast infections. For me, it made mine worse. I live in a badly insulated home,with exposed batts of fiberglass insulation. I had chronic symptoms (tired, crappy digestion, mental fog) which were connected to candida by the Burston Clinic. However, nothing I did made a difference. Diet, supplements, prescription anti-fungals had little effect. I discovered the connection by accident. After insulating a garage with no protection, I developed a terrible cough which lasted for weeks. An emergency room physician told me the insulation fibers were causing my cough. This made me fearful, and I removed or covered all exposed insulation in the house. My symptoms improved remarkably. Since you’ve left your job, hopefully this will improve things for you."
0,Determined,296,"Hello everyone! I’ve been poking around the forum for a few weeks now, and I am on my 6th day of the cleanse. I thought would be nice to have some support and to be a support for others going through the same things. So here I am. How did I get here? It’s definitely been a long time coming. I just turned 40 this year. I had been struggling with fatigue, depression, joint pain, and headaches for quite some time now. Over the last ten years, I’d been through a lot of life changing events and thought perhaps all the stress had caused me to be sick. It was probably the thing that put it over the edge. I’ve known for many years that I’d had a problem with candida. Most of my early 20’s was spent struggling with chronic yeast infections. About 10 years ago, I went to a naturopath, and was told I needed to start a diet to get rid of an overgrowth of yeast. I took one look at the list of what you couldn’t eat and immediately dismissed it. There was NO WAY I was giving up on those things! I am a total junkie for potatoes, cheese, coffee, beer, CHEESE. So, time progressed, I wasn’t getting as many yeast infections, (probably because the little beasts moved elsewhere in my body), and I felt ok for awhile. Then all hell broke loose. In the span of two years, I bought a house, got pregnant, got engaged, filed for bankruptcy, got married, had a baby, got divorced, sold the house, moved out into a moldy apartment(reading raster’s story really put some more things into perspective), came down with Epstein Barr, started having panic attacks and diagnosed with having seizures. I was then put on some gnarly pharmaceuticals and wanted to die, took myself off of them, and yet, I have never felt good since. Boy howdy, have I felt crappy! It’s been almost 8 years since all that happened. I am re-married, living in a nice, mold free apartment, and my sweet baby boy is growing up. But I was still feeling horrible! Having no health insurance made it very difficult and expensive to see a doctor. I felt sick, but not enough to shell out a bunch of money just to have the doctor shrug his shoulders and tell me to come back in a week, shell out more money, then have him put me on more horrible pharmaceuticals. I finally got online and started researching some of my symptoms and stumbled on this site. That’s when the light came on! So, after a few weeks of research and preparation, here I am, 6 days into the cleanse. I am feeling pretty sick right now. Mostly horrendous body aches. But I know it’s a good sick, like this stagnant crap is finally moving and shaking loose. Lack of available funds made me unable to pick up any molybdenum before I started. But I have milk thistle, and Epsom salt baths to get me through. Thanks for letting me share, and I’ll be happy to update on my progress if anyone is interested. I’m happy to have this forum as a resource!"
0,YB,297,"I am 29 years old and recently diagnosed myself with Candida. I think I was always sensitive to it. As far as I can remember as a teen I felt fatigue and had fungus in my toe nails, which was taken care of with a prescription my doctor gave me back than. I have been very healthy in most of my 20th.. till about 2 years ago I was under a lot of stress, ate out more and had a yeast infection, which happened 3 months in a row, the last time I took a pill my doctor gave me and it went away. I tried to control my stress for that. Last year I started drinking few times a week, drank all summer,ate out, partied a lot, had fun but.. by fall I started having this terrible tightening feeling in my throat, the more stressed I felt the worst it got. Also horrible leg itching, muscle twitching once in a while, sometimes would last for few days. I started having swelling under my left eye, went to a doctor who couldn’t figure it out. The front of my scalp was kind of dry and had a white coating on it. I also started having fungus in my toe nails again. Relaxing was definitely the way to control the symptoms, wasn’t always possible though. This whole past year I felt something was wrong but couldn’t figure it out, I was more depressed, mood swings, irritated, angry, couldn’t concentrate at anything, very fogy.. etc.  2 1/2 years ago I was the positive person who cheered up the world, I was strong and all the sudden everything changed, I couldn’t control my own feelings. I became restless and a miserable person, had to have a shot of adrenaline to feel better. Unfortunately I knew its time to grow up and stop partying. My new year resolution was to stop drinking. Though I stopped drinking I still didn’t feel better, the tightening in my throat was driving me crazy, I felt dead, I thought I might as well be one! Couple of months ago I was on vacation, ate out, lots of sugar, which I never do. Add some big amounts of stress. I started to develop strange symptoms, went to doctor and was diagnosed with yeast infection and Bacterial Vaginosis. Got on antibiotics. Changed my diet to healthier one too. Went back to another doctor few days later as symptoms didn’t change and got worse after antibiotics. He said first Antibiotics didn’t work, Now he put me on stronger ones for 7 days with a yeast infection treatment to follow. I didn’t know I was on the candida diet already kind of (since I strict what I ate already) called my doctor everyday with all those symptoms I thought were from medication, now I know it was Candida die off. Once I was done with both treatments symptoms were still there. I was feeling very weak, tired, strange muscle pains, strange mental state. I thought I was going crazy till I figured I am detoxifying from something. Since I pretty much started the candida diet without knowing couple of weeks earlier, I now went strict on it. I guess I am on it though for 2 and a half weeks. Just finished strict diet day 3. Also been taking for past three days 3 times a day the Reuteri Superior probiotic (Multi stain) from whole foods for Digestion, immunity and nutrient uptake. Reducing it to 2 pills daily now and adding Kefir(From Goats). Gosh that kefir gave me some die off symptoms immediately. Another thing to mention, couple of days ago I had what looked like fungus in my feces, I guess I am on track. Changing my diet wasn’t too bad, I usually eat all those healthy foods anyways. Fruits is the only thing I am missing. I am experiencing a lot of twitching in ear, left eye, which pretty much stopped few days later. Also strange joints aches, which will disappear a minute later. Strange headaches. I also am having strange pulsation feeling in my private area, like something is moving there, is alive, real strange. My yeast infection is dying out though. When my eyes start burning I make sure to drink extra water which solves it right away, I read it something to do with liver function. I don’t have lots of energy overall, not too bad though. I think now it mainly affect my mental state, I really thought I was loosing my mind today, my vision have weaken and I felt very depressed, irritated and disconnected. I really had to pull myself back to reality. The body symptoms are nothing compared to the mental ones. I need to remind myself its not me but my Candida die off symptoms. I am gonna start adding Oregano Oil to my everyday for immunity. Not sure when,focusing on listening to my body for that.  As much as I wanna give up, I know it’s for the best, things will change soon, in the end of the dark tunnel there is always LIGHT! I read a lot of frustrating posts here and I had to say; If we believe, we will see the light, lets practice trust!! I am gonna start meditating more too, to keep my brain in track.. it is a mind body and soul overall thing. Candida starts when we subject ourselves to the lower frequency of being, the more joy and content we feel inside the faster it will die. So no matter how scary and lost we all feel in that tunnel in the near future, we all have unbelievable strength inside, if we ask for it, its always there. There will be light in the end, we will succeed! “If you think you can do a thing or think you can’t do a thing, you’re right” Henry Ford"
1,goingnatural,297,Welcome to our “club”. It is always nice to have positive people and congrats on taking the plunge into the diet!
0,benc,298,"I started following the website diet from March, but on advise from Able & Raster I started their format, with what could only really be described as a 2 days cleanse (if that, one day I ate nothing, the next day I only ate green veg). I had horrendous die off where I felt so low on energy I would wake up feeling like I was dead, the same as many I’m sure. Getting out of the bath would take a massive effort of will power as my legs felt like I had done 1000reps of squats. The skin on my hand blistered so bad, I had to wear medical gloves under lifting gloves at work (I work at a gym). On a few occasion when I had bad digestive days I would do a 24 hour intermittent fast. It helped & increased my energy, but my main concern in doing it weekly is if I have adrenal fatigue I need energy dripped fed to my body. Coming up to July I generally feel a lot better, although the hayfever season is bad in London this year. My hands have not fully recovered and they still have outbreaks, usually 2 weeks in to switching my antifungals or when i’ve eaten lots of swede (rutabaga) more than 2 days in a row. I’ve also notice I get post eating fatigue, especially morning & lunchtimes. Cutting portion size down helps a bit, but I often work for 3-5 hours straight with clients in the morning without a break, so I try to eat enough for breakfast to keep me going. Things I noticed I had leaky guy reactions to were: Powdered paprika: I would get really itchy eyes to the extent I would have to go to bed & often wake up feeling like I had conjunctivitis Pea protein Isolates: I would sneeze & my hayfever symptoms would heighten Rio trading pau d’arco tea: This always gave me a die off reaction (which may be a good sign), but my stool would always be a very tar like and if I drunk to much it would give me haemorrhoids. Green powders: They taste like crap, and I didn’t notice much of a benefit from ingesting them, I often felt worse for taking them. I was mixing spirulina, chlorella & barley grass, I dropped wheat grass on Able’s advice. Things i’ve noticed that helped: Kefir: After the initial die off from trying homemade kefir & organic yogurt I feel a lot better. Switching from organic cows milk to raw goats milk has been better for me as well. I’ve also tried water kefir, but it always came out like alcohol. Coconut water kefir using milk grains has been a success though, it doesn’t taste as good as normal coconut water, but is a lower calorie version of kefir (if thats something your looking for) Sauerkraut: With Juniper berries, taste great & another probiotic. I eat it at least once per day. If your in the UK Biona do a nive one. Things i’ve introduced that i’ve not noticed much of a reaction too: Brown rice protein powder: This, along with hemp protein, seem to be the best option for me. I don’t have much, just if i’m working out. Blueberries: I don’t eat them that often but seemed ok with the small amount Raster suggested No sugar chicken dhansak curry: I’ve had a few take aways from a trusted curry house I used to order from. I cook my own roasted buckwheat as the rice replacement. The foods in the dish that are not on the stage 2 list are lentils and tomatoes. I don’t eat it often however. Eating animal protein more than once per day: I don’t do this everyday but i’ve had days where I would eat chicken for lunch & then fish for dinner, and I seem to be ok with it. A normals days diet would look like this Wake Up: Glutamine, acetyl l carnitine, 5htp. hayfever drugs (cetirizine dihydrochloride) Breakfast: Goats milk kefir with maca & slipper elm. 2-3 eggs pancake made with hemp protein, chia seeds, cinnamon, ginger & stevia powder. + Antifungals (SF722, caprylic acid or liquid grapefruit extract) & multi vit, vit d3, vit a, vit c, molybdenum, ashwagandha, betaine HCL, MSM, Milk Thistle Lunch: Eggs or animal protein with 2-3 veg (roasted or/and steamed), coconut oil & olive oil. + Antifungals (SF722, caprylic acid or liquid grapefruit extract) vit c, molybdenum, C0q10, Magnesium, betaine HCL, MSM, Feverfew, Milk Thistle Dinner Eggs or animal protein with 2-3 veg (roasted or/and steamed), coconut oil &/or olive oil, avocado. + Antifungals (SF722, caprylic acid or liquid grapefruit extract) vit c, molybdenum, ashwagandha, betaine HCL, Feverfew, Magnesium, Zinc, Milk Thistle. Before bed: Megaflora probiotic, Glutamine Drinks: Water, organic herbal teas, chicory coffee. If I snack it would be. Post exercise: brown rice protein shake with water, glutamine, l glycine, slipper elm & stevia.  Or non exercise day: Goats milk kefir with maca, slipper elm, milled flaxseed & stevia. Today I made coconut macaroons as a treat, using egg white, desiccated coconut & stevia. I sometime make hemp protein cakes as a treat, but rarely do this. I’m going abroad for 2 weeks in August and hoping to be able to get by with just antifungals, probiotic tablets & following a sensible diet. I don’t really miss drinking alcohol (as I had 15 months of feeling drunk & not knowing why I was dizzy), or eating sugar or high starch (as i get fat on these foods), but would like to think I could try the odd steak. I’m a bit concerned that its not easy to source organic dairy from the supermarket, which is why I’m going to rely on the tablets as opposed to yogurt. Thanks for everyone help on here, I would appreciate any input."

0,Amy316,300,"Hi, I have been struggling with candida overgrowth for almost 7 years. I have had on going yeast infections, sensitivity to caffeine, anything sugar, and fruits. I have taken many different antifungals from the doctors and healthcare providers. They seem to work in the beginning and make my rash go away, but before you know it it is all back. Nothing seems to help for the long term. I have been on several candida diet plans for months at a time and start to feel better, also many dietary supplements, but the next few days after I start to slowly add in a fruit or some cheese my symptoms return.  I have had severe die off symptoms when I do a cleanse and feel awful for the first week or so. I am sure I have an abundance of toxins in my liver and gut. I have a very bad rash on the inside of my legs and on my rear end. It is very uncomfortable and seems to get a lot worse when a have a fruit or a little bit of sugar. I know this is related to the candida overgrowth. I would love for some information on how to make my rash more comfortable during the hot summer months. I have read over your cleanse and believe this might work for me. I have high hopes and am going to go at it full blown. I’m tired of living my life in a fog and hurting all over.  Thank you for such a great site to help people who have been struggling with something so awful. Look forward to interacting with people on here to see what they have to say."
1,Able900,300,"Hello, Amy, welcome to the forum.It is very uncomfortable and seems to get a lot worse when a have a fruit or a little bit of sugar. That’s because the fruit and sugar are food for Candida which allowed the infestation or population to grow, making the symptoms worse. Following our protocol, which is posted along with the other links in my signature section below, will start the healing process from inside your body. Since the rash concerns the skin, I would try to obtain an prescription antifungal by the name of Nystatin. This works well as a topical application for the rash. You might also check out the index link below and see if there are other subjects of interest to you. Let us know if you have questions. Able"
0,goingnatural,301,"Before I say anymore I decided to write this to you all because I have come to accept, after a few relapses over the last almost 2 years, that I need support; and the closest support I can find for this sort of thing is on these forums. I don’t know about you but I like being reminded that: I AM NOT ALONE. So, thank you. A little bit about me:  I have been battling issues for as long as I can remember. I was a little boy with lots of GI problems, ADD, OCD, ear infections (with several rounds of antibiotic treatments). Fast forward to the future and my problems worsened to: insomnia, muscular weakness/pain, testicular pain, brain fog, fatigue, lots of GI issues, hypertension, hypoglycemia, and emotional/mental challenges. My confirmed food sensitivities are to: MSG (fermented products in general), diary, wheat, garlic, yeast, shellfish, and eggs. I have been eating clean since May 28th and yesterday I experimented with Coconut Amino’s (which I reacted to) — Hence why I know now that I have a confirmed issues with MSG/fermented products). I am on a treatment program suggested by a doctor and nutritionist; I will continue to update this as I go forward. Thank you for your support!"
1,goingnatural,301,"Week 2The one word that I think best describes this week would be: Cyclical. My body goes through Cycles of the same physical symptoms. Some of my symptoms this week were: Reddened knuckles, burning feet/toes, burning scalp, burning around private area, burning axilla, sore throat, itchy anus, periods of fatigue/brain fog, left sided testicular pain, low mood + anxiety. Good points: I don’t have the chronic, never-ending, muscle/joint pain I have become so accustomed to, instead the pain comes and goes like waves now (Much like my stomach). Albeit rare, I have also had moments of real clarity and happiness. The kind of thinking and feeling that many people probably take for granted but has been so elusive for me (and other Candida sufferers). Going forward: I will continue to be steadfast in this process knowing that it is going to take quite some time."
2,goingnatural,301,"Week 3-5 Mentally speaking The last week or so has been the hardest. I have been fatigued, anxious, brain foggy, and experienced some real low moods. All apart of the process I know. Physically speaking Bowel movements haven’t been the greatest until, quite literally an hour ago. A lot of muscle/joint pain, acne breakout on my neck, stomach pains, bloating, insomnia, ear pain/itchiness (week 3). Also, starting at week 3 I began a chelation process for heavy metals. We found high levels of lead and mercury in my urine and this may have increased my negative detoxy symptoms."

0,MachHin,303,"Hi candida sufferers, This is my first post. I have been on the diet for one and a half month now without touching the foods to avoid. The only exception was yesterday when I ate a chicken sausage. As everyone here knows chicken is allowed on the diet but I forgot that sausages often contain other ingredients. I realized it when I had eaten the first one. : ( 75% of it was chicken and the rest was a form of sugar, mustard and yeast. Did this screw up the diet? coming back to the topic the diet has been very depressing so far as I love good food and going out for dinner or so. Now this isnt possible anymore and god knows how many months this will take. I could scream…..I cant go out because I can neither drink nor eat anything. This is a nightmare for a food lover like me. No sushi no nothing….. And also the supplements and other products are so expensive and have cost a fortune so far. The diet blasts a huge hole in my pockets. Any advice would be great cheers"
1,Javizy,303,"Can’t you go somewhere that serves meat/fish and veg/salad? It can be hard to avoid additives, but things like steak are generally straightforward. Getting stressed about not eating is going to work against you more than whatever you’re avoiding."
2,MachHin,303,"If you order a steak most likely something will come with it right? Like potatoes, noodles sauces and so on. I bet none of the candida sufferers can eat the sauces at the restaurants as they most likely contain butter or something else we shouldnt eat. Often the meat is fried in butter as well.  And aside you dont even know what they use to prepare their meals even if you ask. So I decided to not eat out. I think the only thing possible to eat is fish sashimi with coconut aminos instead of soy sauce."
3,Able900,303,"The only exception was yesterday when I ate a chicken sausage.I know you don’t want to hear this, but you really should limit meat (chicken included) to about two or three times a week. The reason is twofold; unless you’re obtaining organic meats at each meal, then you’re ingesting hormones and antibiotics every time you eat it. In addition, each time you eat meat or chicken you’re allowing the protein that is broken down to release ammonia into your intestines and stomach which only benefits the Candida providing them with a better environment in which to thrive and multiply.I could scream…..I cant go out because I can neither drink nor eat anything. This is a nightmare for a food lover like me. No sushi no nothing.. Do you think the rest of the members didn’t enjoy food as well? Try not to see yourself as the only person who loved food and had to go through this, it just might make things a bit easier for you to realize you’re not in that boat alone.  I didn’t go out to eat and drank water for almost three straight months when I had been used to going out 5 to 7 times a week. After sticking with the protocol long enough to cure the infestation I’m now going out again at least 5 or 6 times a week, sometimes more. But that’s the point, you have to stick with it if you’re going to rid your body of the infestation, otherwise, you’ll just start going around in circles of killing and then feeding the Candida.And also the supplements and other products are so expensive and have cost a fortune so far. The diet blasts a huge hole in my pockets.I imagine everyone on the forum has holes in their pockets by now, so again, not alone. Just don’t waste your money on unnecessary products. When you see something you might need, unless it’s on the forum’s protocol, run it by the forum first to see if it would be a waste of money. Able"
4,cerenurt,303,"MachHin, I’m sorry this is so difficult! I’m not sure if what I have to say will help, but I’ll give you some thoughts coming from my own perspective. First of all, I KNOW how hard it is because I’d been going about 5 years trying to stick to an “ok” diet without sugar or gluten but cheating when I was stressed out, felt social pressure when eating out, or around the holidays. It’s only by some miracle that it’s finally the right time for me to just do it and actually succeed in sticking with it! The hardest part was psychological. Like you, I’ve only been on this diet for about a month, but I think those 5 years kind of prepared me psychologically. It’s either this, or suffer physically like I had been with the psoriasis and yeast infections. And most importantly, I am SO DETERMINED to get better, that cheating is not even an option now. I’ve mentally prepared myself to accept that it will take at least 6 months, and possibly up to 2 years (or more) for my particular situation. I’ve found that fighting this idea just makes things more difficult. But accepting it, and knowing that in the end I will be healed makes me happy! I also have a completely different perspective on food now, which helps a lot. I no longer see food as a source of entertainment, which is how food is often seen in our society. Look at all the cooking shows, restaurant meals, how we elaborately prepare meals at home. Not that this is a BAD thing, but it raises our expectations of how a meal should be: beautiful presentation with lots of textures, flavors, and variety etc. Is this really natural for humans? Or are we as a society making food more than what it needs to be? Hmmm… 🙂 Instead, I see food as something to take seriously as a source of nourishment, NOT something that I expect to make me feel good. Food is simply a way to keep us alive and healthy. So now, instead of feeling sad that I can’t eat a cheeseburger and fries because it makes me “feel good”, I feel gratitude that I get to eat at all and not be hungry! I think another reason I can stick to the diet now is because, having suffered from depression for much of my life, I’m in a much better mental state than I used to be. You can’t really accomplish or be motivated for much when you’re feeling depressed. So taking care of yourself mentally and spiritually is a VERY important part of healing as well. Do whatever you can to TREAT YOURSELF and make yourself feel good whenever possible (that doesn’t involve cheating!) 🙂 I’m not sure if this helps you, but maybe it will help someone who happens to be reading this. *hugs*"

6,Tulip,303,"For me,in terms of strength and motivation,it’s that I have no other decision! Candida has been a health wake up call for me,even though I was “healthy” before,being vegan and then raw vegan.But I have no other option,no other decision.We are blessed to be alive,and we have to take care of ourselves,be educated,informed and know that we are making the best decisions for ourselves.I recall reading on some website about a person who had Candida who didn’t change their diet for 10 years! And all the complaints about health while the person knew fully that it was the diet that it was causing so much suffering and issues! I refuse to do that,I refuse to ignorant,I have to take care of myself,I’m determined and loving and aware,we MUST be! We must love and care for ourselves and our bodies and health so much. I don’t complain about the diet.Last night I made dinner for my family,made a delicious strawberry and carob drink,hummus with sesame oil and mushrooms that right now I am not able to ingest,but so what? All that I am able to feed and nourish myself with I am so grateful for,and I find it derogatory and wasteful to complain about food when millions have no choice in what they eat and the amount they eat.I bless and thank each meal I have.I put LOVE into my food and I know it’s matter of diligence and patience in the long run. Blessings and Namaste Tulip"
7,ichigo13,303,I was always motivated to do the diet thinking of the long term benefits Id get from it. Also the reason why I am doing it. My “DESIRE” for my body to be healed made enough strength to do the strict diet and kept me motivated.

2,raster,304,"I believe this is pretty normal…it shows that you have leaky gut. What kind of reaction did you get, can you describe the symptoms? I personally would get the “leaky gut burn” feeling when I ate something that I’m allergic to…it feels similar to “indian rug burn.” I would eat one spoonful per day for a few days and then stop, and then do this again until you can tolerate greek yogurt. It may take a few weeks/months to heal leaky gut. The good thing is with leaky gut you can tell what you are allergic to easily. Later when your gut heals, it’ll become harder to determine whether something is affecting you negatively or not. On a side note: I don’t think you are eating enough food. Try to add buckwheat to your diet or more items if possible. Try to eat 3-4 course meals.

3,Able900,304,"Did you make your own yogurt? And how much did you eat? According to the protocol, you shouldn’t start eating commercially purchased yogurt until you’ve been on the diet for four weeks. Quote: “Two weeks from the day you actually start the cleanse or after you start the diet if you skip the cleanse, you could test a natural probiotic, specifically homemade kefir or homemade yogurt – if you start one of these at that time, you should definitely use homemade products only and not a commercially purchased of yogurt or kefir. No matter which you start first, eat only 2 or 3 bites the first and second day. Continue to increase the amount by one teaspoon every day until you reach the amount you wish to continue with. If at any time you receive strong die-off symptoms, reduce the amount you’re taking until the symptoms subside, then after a few days slowly start to increase the amount again. Then two weeks later, or four weeks after starting the treatment (cleanse or diet) you can test commercially purchased organic non-sweetened Greek yogurt. Oikos and Fage are two excellent brands.” Read the post below for constipation problems. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1098_Constipation-Remedies.aspx For other problems consult the forum index. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm9960_Index-of-Posts.aspx#post9960 Able"

He feels that everyone with skin issues should take HCL to remedy their problem. However, this is also a symptom of an allergy or it is also a die-off symptom. Your liver and other organs could be too taxed right now to deal with the toxins and thats why it is detoxing via the skin instead.

0,02tactical,305,"I’ve been battling this for about 2 years now, it all started when I had a massive anxiety attack to the point that I thought that I was having a heart attack. Like many other people that post on the forum I saw doctor after doctor and had test after test all off them telling me the same thing, there’s nothing wrong with you.  Eventually I began researching on my own what the hell could be wrong with me. I came across many websites and a ton of information on Candida, took all the little assessments that you find on alot of the websites and scored off the charts. There was no doubt in my mind that I found out exactly what was plaguing me. I had all the signs, headaches, sore throat, oral thrush, re-occuring rashes, digestion problems, acid reflux, anxiety/panic, and many more issues.  About a year ago I discussed this with doctors I was seeing and like many people I was told basically it’s not that there’s no proof that it even exists. So like many other people I went to my chiropractor and started discussing all of this with her she turned me on to candibactin, and bentonite clay, some fiber and something else. She gave me the plan and what to do, how to eat, and so on. It was great for about 2 months I was losing weight, had a ton of energy, felt great, slept great, my wife loved it because I no longer snored things were going great. Then all of the sudden it hit me chills, lethargy, flu like symptoms, I felt like death, chest pains, acid reflux, I only wanted to sleep and that was it for three straight days. I knew better to I knew these were the die off symptoms all the research I had done all the time I had spent learning about it I knew what was occuring, but I wanted it to stop immediately, Some Ginger Ale and some bread took care of it within a day I was feeling better back on my feet. I had given up I thought simply I would just return to the diet and continue were I left off, but I couldn’t bare to take any of that stuff again slowly I returned to eating bad again, brought soda back into my diet, and pretty much just let it all go again. I gained 30 of the 60 pounds I had lost back within 6 months. I was tired again all the time, the heart burn and muscle aches returned and in general I felt like crap. Over the next year I tried multiple things, diets, programs, excercise programs and so on non of it worked non of did what I needed it to do. So here I am bound and determined to go through it again but this time I’m finishing the job. Placed my order for the necessary items this morning I’m on day 1 of the initial cleanse before I implement the entire program. I’m excited to head back down this path, I’m excited to get my life back, to enjoy my family again.  I plan on updating this as often as possible it will serve as my diary on how I feel what I’m thinking and what is going on through out this process."
1,raster,305,"Thanks for sharing your story. If you are interested, we have the forum “protocol” for a good treatment plan, a forum cleanse, and a forum diet (food list). Things typically get worse before they get better and after about a month or so you should start to feel a ton better. -raster"
0,Susansl66,306,"This is my first post and I look forward to connecting with folks who are in a similar boat! Here is my story… Ever since childhood I have suffered with seasonal allergies. When I was a young teen I suffered from terrible dysmenorrhea and was promptly prescribed birth control pills to help ease that suffering. I went on to take birth control pills well into my 30’s. Also as I teen I developed acne and was put on doses of tetracycline. In high school I began experiencing gastrointestinal disturbances…loud tummy rumbling being one of the bizarre things that I remember the most. Things were so bad that I found myself at the family doctor who thought I had an ulcer and prescribed medicine – I can’t remember the name of it, but I do recall that it didn’t help and seemed to resolve on its own. In my early 20’s routine blood work showed that I had exceptionally high cholesterol levels and was asked to follow a ‘bland’ diet for 2+ months. Follow-up blood tests after this strict diet, showed no change in my cholesterol levels so the Dr. announced that it was genetic and nothing to be overly worried about given my age, fitness level, weight etc. In my late 20’s a backpacking trip had me catching a bug which resulted in a trip to the emergency dept. in Spain and a prescription for antibiotics. I returned to Canada still under the weather and being prescribed more antibiotics. A year later I had Mono and Strep – and more prescriptions for antibiotics. Not long after that I developed a strange intensely itchy rash on my abdomen which lasted for a few weeks, went away and came back at the exact same time the following year! I found that in the years to follow I had a lot of nasal congestion, post-nasal drip, coughing – my doc at that time told me I had to learn to live with it…in the meantime, I ate quite a healthy diet, but I loved and craved my cheese, sweets, breads and chocolate! I figured since I was athletic and slim, it wouldn’t do me any harm to indulge once in a while. One morning in my early 30’s, things got really ‘interesting’. I woke up, stood up and immediately fell to the ground when I was overcome with an extreme case of vertigo. Vertigo, spaciness, feeling unbalanced, nausea, fatigue, etc…all of these symptoms hit me like a ton of bricks and I began the seemingly endless round of tests and dr’s visits. All things came back negative…I was told that I was fine and I was of course devastated. This continued for weeks and weeks until I thankfully sought out the services of a Naturopath who took the time to listen to my ‘bizarre’ list of symptoms and swiftly declared that they thought I had candidiasis. I was put on a candida diet and prescribed natural anti-fungals and started feeling better soon after. Within a few months I felt great and let the candida protocol slide – thinking that I had overcome it. A couple of years later, after 2 miscarriages I was finally pregnant, but under extreme stress due to the previous early losses. I had severe morning sickness, but felt some relief during the middle trimester. The 3rd trimester however was almost debilitating – I was extremely tired, lethargic, had awful abdominal pains, insomnia, irritability, craved bread and chips like crazy – my list goes on and on…I was self-injecting with a blood thinner – Fragmin – due to results that suggested I had a slight blood clotting issue during my miscarriage testing. I knew that things were over and above the routine symptoms that pregnant woman experience. Once again my gynecologist couldn’t see how anything was ‘wrong’ so I assumed that all of these things would disappear once the baby was born. Boy, was I wrong! My son was born – healthy and happy. I on the other hand, descended quickly on a spiraling tunnel downwards. Not only did all of pregnancy symptoms continue, but they intensified! In addition a few new ones were added – I didn’t have vertigo this time around, but I did experience strange neurological sensations (electrical tingling feelings throughout my body), wicked nightmares, loss of appetite to name a few. Everything together resulted in ME needing to be taken care of – rather than me being able to properly care for my son. For the past 10 years since my son was born, I have been going from Dr to Dr. trying to find the cause for the symptoms that I’ve been dealing with. Some of the more bizarre symptoms seemed to go away on their own, but some have remained: fatigue, irritability, severe menstrual symptoms, pms, carb cravings, abdominal pain – especially under right ribs, constipation at times, gas, belching, bloating, tightness in the muscles, feeling tight in the abdomen, nasal congestion, low libido, feeling lethargic at times, feeling ‘heavy’ at times, etc. During this past decade, I have had the standard medical tests (all which indicate that I’m fine or that it’s all in my head so the prescription pad for anti-depressants came out 🙁 I’ve also been trying a number of different things on my own – liver cleanses, colon cleanses, colonics, homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, naturopathy, etc. I’ve also tried countless different diets, Atkins, Raw, Vegetarian, etc. Oddly enough, it has only been recently that I’m thinking that candidiasis may be the culprit!! Since many of the symptoms when I was pregnant were somewhat different than when I had it before, I didn’t even think that it may be the same thing presenting in a different manner! I’ve done a few candida questionnaires (including the one offered by William Crook) and my results are off the charts. I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired and am eager and excited to get started on the Candida Diet protocol. I’ve read that there is a ‘strict’ version of the candida diet and am interested in hearing from others out there to find out what their experiences have been for both the diet portion of the protocol and the rest of it too! I’m wanting to tame this beast as quickly as I can, and am pretty much ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen!"
1,raster,306,"Hello Susan, Your story is very interesting and it shows how western medicine can fail over and over and it doesn’t effectively heal everyone. I am saddened that you have such bad symptoms… Dr. Mcoomb’s feels that anyone who has taken antibiotics has a gut flora imbalance and some of the flora you lost may never return again because the antibiotics destroyed it. I also think that you may not have “cured” your infestation the first time around and that why it came back. Stress can effect the immune system negatively and likely ran you into the ground. Please let us know how you progress and whether you experience die-off symptoms, etc. I also highly suspect that you may have parasites which may have or may not have caused the miscarriages. Everyone has bugs but at different levels. Luckily parasites are killed in a similar manner as the candida diet and protocol, so you won’t need to change many things to kill them off effectively. Just wanted to share with you my analysis and hope it doesn’t effect you negatively. I hope that you understand that it takes a very long time to heal the body and it can take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth. Eating healthy in the long term will assure that this sucker won’t return. -raster"
2,Susansl66,306,"Thank you so much Raster for your comments. I have been forwarded the strict diet protocol from Able and look forward to starting this program. Having gone through regimens in the past, I know it’s going to be tough, but this particular plan (which I’ve read multiple times!) seems to make a lot of sense to me! I can see how even the order in which I may have done things in the past, may have done more harm than good. I’m very grateful to have this forum to turn to 🙂 You mention the possibility of parasites…I have done a few different parasite cleanses in the past so I’m not freaked out by the possibility! You mentioned that I wouldn’t need to change many things to kill them off effectively. Are there other things that I would need to consider doing and how would one know to do that? As I await my order of Molybdenum to arrive from the US, I’m prepping myself by gathering the other items suggested on the protocol. I do have a couple of questions for you…can you confirm – what is the amount of Vitamin D3 and Vitamin A that should be taken? It says ‘take at least 5000 to 10,000 units a day only in gel form for at least a few weeks…’ is that 5000 – 10000 IU/day for each? Also, where the cal/mag/zinc is concerned – if the daily values are over, is that ok? Best, Susan"

Now that I know what is wrong, there is something incredibly healing in knowing there are others who can help and who understand. I have been sick since November of 2010. This past summer I was the sickest I have ever been in my life. Many times I thought I was going to die. 20 doctors later, I know there are a lot of illnesses and diseases that I don’t have. ha..ha….But finding a diagnosis and a doctor to help was next to impossible. I believe that I have been a long standing celiac though I have had negative blood work (twice) and negative biopsies. The problems seem so clear now that I have a diagnosis. How could so many doctors overlook 11 rounds of antibiotics in a little over a year – how could they not see that I was completely void of healthy bacteria and sitting ready for a fungal overgrowth? Then….to my horror – the house that I had moved into in the fall of 2010 had mold air sample readings (2012) that were in the 37,000s in the middle of winter. Untreated celiac + lots of antibiotics + toxic mold exposure = a very sick person. I have been on Diflucan for 12 weeks as well as many other natural antifungals. I am rotating my natural antifungals now and my diet. I have been following “the diet” and am now following the diet posted to this forum earlier that is now available by email. The forum has allowed me to fix several small but crucial diet problems. I am stuck in “death house” until June 1. Then I hope my life can start over again. Two years lost already and from most accounts, two years of hard work of recovery ahead of me. In time, I may get around to posting the litany of horrific symptoms – so that I may help others to recognize what is wrong and so that they can begin to repair. Thank you for running this forum. It is priceless."

In time, I may get around to posting the litany of horrific symptoms – so that I may help others to recognize what is wrong and so that they can begin to repair. Thank you for running this forum. It is priceless. Regarding Celiac disease, getting blood work done for IgA seems to work for some but for others creates false negatives. So generally if the person displays classic symptoms of Celiac the doctor refers to a GI doctor where they would do a small biopsy of your gut, that will confirm or deny it.  Did you regular GP prescribe you Diflucan? if so 12 weeks seems to be a long time, more than a four week treatment requires liver enzyme testing because of the toxicity it creates when it gets absorbed into the blood stream. A much better medicinal anti-fungal is Nystatin it does not get absorbed and works in the gut, where Fluconazole gets absorbed by the liver and works through the blood, only effective in systemic infections. You have not mentioned probiotics in your story , they are the most crucial part of your recovery. The best kind are fermented ones such as Kefir, Water Kefir, Sauerkraut, and Greek Yoghurt. You will need commercial probiotics also they will give you the high counts in the billions, the naturally fermented ones are much lower however they are way more diverse and stick to the stomach and gut much better and have a better chance of multiplying. You must use or eat Prebiotics, those feed the bacteria, examples are Inulin, Acacia Fibre, Oat Bran, Rice Bran, Garlic, Leeks, Flax Seeds.

2,Able900,307,"how could they not see that I was completely void of healthy bacteria and sitting ready for a fungal overgrowth?Probably because, unfortunately, sometimes a doctor’s goal is not to cure you but to count the times he or she can collect another fee from you. If the doctor had admitted that you were void of healthy bacteria, he would be expected to do something about it, and if he did this, it would lessen the chance of collecting fees from you several more times.I am stuck in “death house” until June 1 I’m assuming that you’re taking all precautions possible until you are able to leave the premises. A mold-spore protective face mask is the most cost effective solution if you have no choice but to breathe the air in the house.  These mold spores are in the micron size range, so paper-type masks or a mask similar to a surgeon’s mask are not very protective against the spores. What you would probably need is an industrial or medical respirator in order to avoid breathing in the mold. Able"
3,raster,307,"I had a mold problem in my apartment that was partially responsible for me getting ill with candida. You are not alone! I was out of work for 2 years and did nothing but apply for jobs all day and sit my my moldy apartment. The mold existed in the bathroom which was due to lack of ventilation. I used to hyperventilate for hours and only felt good when not at the apartment. Eventually I started to have seizures in my sleep and that point I decided to move out. There are things you can do to protect yourself from mold. A dehumidifier will remove moisture in the air. An air purifier with purify the air you breath (some atleast). Vinegar and bleach kill (visible) mold and light kills mold as well. I am sure you’ve read up on this stuff so just stating some basic things… One way to get your landlord to “comply” with your health is to bust out the county health inspector on their ass. That’ll get them nice and pissed off and they will have to do everything possible to fix the problem at that point. Who knows, maybe they will even evict you! If they don’t comply there will be leins against the property. Also, if you didn’t know this, you can have a “breach of contract” with the landlord for not having a healthy, unhabitable place to live. Mold is something you can use to breach you lease with the landlord. The landlord likely will fight this, but if you get a good lawyer, you have the upper hand. Additionally, if you find a good doctor, you can get “toxic mold poisoning” diagnosed and then sue your landlord for having a dwelling that has poisoned you. You can make them pay for your health expenses, etc. This is a big longshot, but since you have documented high levels within the air…it’ll be easier to prove your case. Mold ruined my life and I started to get ill around the same time as you in November 2010. Once I moved out I immediately started to get better. However, I truly did not feel “normal” until I got started on the candida diet and have since been on the diet for the last 11 months. I wish you luck with this problem; if you start getting seizures like I did, then I would consider moving out despite the costs. -raster"
4,s.,307,"Thank you all for your replies. It was my seven pound seven ounce cat that was the warning sign for the mold. One night she started vomiting foam, her pupils dilated, she went very cold and stiff. She spent four days in ICU. The first day they thought she wasn’t going to recover, but they kept working on her and she survived. Perfect blood work, perfect x-rays…….no idea what had happened, other than a grand mal seizure. After my undiagnosable mystery illness, and then the added trauma of our cat, I called for a mold test and bingo. “Death House” is a complicated story with many variables that I can’t or don’t want to get into here, but basically all the mold is in the dirt crawl space under the house and the house is a pile of sticks sitting on an open pit. Steps have been made to remediate, but they are just not good enough for me or up to my standards, so we are leaving. I worry about my pets – three cats. They are all eating tons of food (sound familiar)? I wonder if when we are out, I shouldn’t do some sort of protocol for them as well. I am taking Vital 10 for my probiotic and am eating lots and lots of leeks and garlic. I have now just purchased flax seed. It was the oatmeal that messed me up again. The list that the doctor gave me – it was on there, but saw on the forum that it should be oat bran. Since stopping that, and red and green peppers, I am mending again. Too scared to try the Oat Bran yet, but I have purchased it. I do have a question though – has anyone else experienced spine pain? When this all started, I would have electric shocks in my spine (neck area and between shoulder blades) and goose bump patterns in weird shapes on my left arm. I thought the goose bump patterns could have been a mild seizure symptom, and thankfully those haven’t happened in a long time. But, my spine still gets really stiff and painful. Just like a log. Is it nutrition issues? Fungus? Any thoughts? I sleep on a heating pad every single night. Again, thanks for all your replies. It is indescribable to be able to talk about this without someone arguing with me or doubting me or wearing me out. I wish I would have found the forum a lot earlier. P.S. I was on Nystatin for the first two weeks as well as Diflucan for the first two weeks 100mg per day. Now I am on Diflucan on just Monday, Wednesday, Friday in 100mg dose. I have rashes on my face, neck, armpits, behind knees, all over lower legs, ankles and tops of feet. They are getting much better, but they tend to pop back up when it gets really warm out. They are better, but they are not gone – just dormant. That’s why I know I still have a ways to go. Does anyone else do really poorly in hot weather. My hands and feet get really red when it is 85 degrees or higher outside."
5,s.,307,"I’m in the home stretch! Just a few more days until moving day!!!! As an update – I am doing better. Making water kefir now. Still on very strict diet. Having more good days than bad days, but can’t wait to push this forward in a new environment. Thanks to all of you here, I have made great improvements………apple cider vinegar was the best thing that has happened in a long time……I’ll keep you all posted."

12,s.,307,"Yes I’m really serious. I don’t think you caught what was in the link. The protocol. I’ve studied it, memorized it, lived it. I myself take SF722. The link is a dosage and product for PETS! In the thread I asked if anyone had any idease for treating my cats. Like Raster and myself, my cats have been affected as well. I was so happy to see it for their sake and I’m going to try it along with some other measures that I know to be safe. Their little systems can’t handle and do all that we humans do. I think you just misread my post. Hoping so anyway……"
0,cerenurt,308,"Wow, I can’t believe it’s only been ONE WEEK since I wrote my last update! *sigh* Well, the psoriasis is basically the same as it’s been for the past 2 weeks or so. When I cut out ALL fruit, sugars, flours, condiments, etc with no cheating, the psoriasis calmed down to about 50% of what it was, a huge improvement. But since then it’s been going in cycles, getting a little red and flaky and then calming down again, but never as bad as it’s original state. I feel like this is more of a cycle than having to do with anything I’m eating. I’m just mentioning all this in case there is anyone else with a skin condition whose been noticing the same pattern while on the candida diet. I’m hoping this is a “two steps forward, one step back” type of thing, and have a feeling it is more to with my leaky gut not being completely healed yet (which I know can take a LONG time.) Currently my daily diet looks like this (all food is organic): -Slippery Elm capsules 1/2 hour before eating before each meal for leaky gut -Vitamins -Green tea in the morning, with another later if I REALLY need it due to lack of sleep -2 eggs -2 servings of gluten-free oatmeal (1 in the a.m. and 1 for lunch) -coconut bread (usually at night) -lightly sauteed cabbage or other vegetable -salad with ACV and olive oil and/or zucchini (I have a plant growing many zucchinis in my garden!) 😀 -greek yogurt or kefir -occasionally a bit of raw organic pumpkin seeds if I need a snack  -Broccoli, Cauliflower, Spaghetti squash, or other type of vegetable that is allowed -Rutabaga about 2xs per week -I will occasionally allow fish or chicken in my diet (but haven’t for the past week) -Each night, at least 2 mugs of Saffron Tea which acts as an astringent for leaky gut (do not take with Slippery Elm because they will counteract each other) -Megaflora probiotic before bed I am very surprised at how well I’ve adjusted to this form of limited eating! At first I was so freaked out that I wouldn’t get enough carbs and protein and would be starving to death. I actually feel LESS HUNGRY and am losing weight. I don’t even miss fruit. I eat the oatmeal to prevent ketosis, which is very bad for the organs. I’m still thinking of going on the VERY strict diet from Able and Raster when the timing is right. I’m curious to see what it will do to my psoriasis! Right now I have stopped all antifungals because I have an important job interview next Thursday and want to make sure I’m feeling as good as I can for it. The antifungals were making me sooo tired some days. I’ll start back up with the antifungals again after the interview is over with. I was taking SF722 and am considering taking Oregano Oil to see what that is like. I also have a bunch more supplements on order right now includings Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega, garlic perles, L-glutamine, and zinc. Anyone with psoriasis or other skin condition have experiences similar to this? Did anything help it heal faster?"
0,mrs.candida,309,"I’m posting my experience in case it helps someone. Some of the best advise I have gotten has been from reading others stories. I have been to over 30 doctors in the past 15 years, trying to find out what was wrong with me. Plenty of them suggested it was in my head, I had lots of lovely diagnosis including fibromyalgia, depression, adrenal fatigue, and carbohydrate intolerance. I didn’t start the diet until I asked a psychic why I couldn’t lose weight, her answer was “you have Candida”. I suspect I’ve had Candida since I was a small child, I’m 37 now. My mom loves antibiotics! She even purchased some when we traveled together overseas, since she didn’t need a prescription. I also remember having vaginal itching when I was a very young girl, it probably started around the time I had my tonsils taken out. I’m pretty sure I had a lot of antibiotics before age 5. All through my 20’s I would get reoccuring yeast infections, every time I went to a doctor they would take a culture and say “you don’t have a yeast infection, you have tons of healthy flora”. I’m not sure what was happening here, I saw over 15 doctors for vaginal itching and burning. Eventually it went away, but that was about the time the random symptoms started accumulating (insomnia, extreme bloating, depression, frequent sore throats, unexplained weight gain). At age 34 I had my first pregnancy, it ended in miscarriage. I soon got pregnant again and had a healthy son. My pregnancy was HARD, I was sick every single day all day long. The only foods I could keep down were fruit , bread and sugar. I have since learned that pregnancy can be a lovely environment for Candida to thrive. When my son was born we breastfed. It took two months for Thrush to attack us and we could not continue. Even if I would have been able to tolerate the pain, I didn’t make enough milk. My son had Thrush in his mouth. His doctor prescribed him Nystatin, in different amounts twice and it did nothing for his Thrush. I decided to try GSE ( Grapefruit Seed Extract) I diluted it in water and wiped his tongue with it 2X’s a day. It took about two weeks for it to be gone. I started the diet with the intention of doing a 14 day cleanse. I got about 4 days before my muscles got so sore I couldn’t sleep. I had to add my multivitamin back in. I suspect this was because I have such severe malabsorption. On day 7 I added eggs and started feeling better. As for die off symptoms during my cleanse, I developed my first case of Oral Thrush, with a icky coated white tongue, and I’d experience flashes of vaginal itching. I have been on and off sugar for the last year in a half, realizing that my body does not tolerate it well. The one symptom that giving up sugar relieved immediately was my insomnia. I had a problem staying asleep for years. I also had to nap everyday because I was so exhausted. After four weeks on the diet and cleanse I no longer needed to nap daily, and my oral thrush was gone. After 6 weeks on the diet I still had post nasal drip, I had lived with it for over 5 months on and off. I had a brilliant idea to put some GSE in my neti pot, I first searched around online to see how it should be done and came across a story of a women who put in 5 drops and burned her sinuses. I decided to start with 1 drop. It didn’t hurt or burn my sinuses but I felt the fever come on almost instantly. I spent the next 3 days sick with a mild fever, and flu symptoms. I also worked my way up to 3 drops of GSE in the neti pot. On day 3 I started feeling better, much more energy then before and absolutely no more post nasel drip. However, I got some new strange symptoms. The palms of my hands, soles of my feet and my tongue all felt tingling, burning, pain, and sensitivity, to the point where it hurt to walk. I was also very swollen (but that’s normal for me). I was afraid I had nerve damage from something I was taking, maybe an anti fungal. I went to acupuncture, the LAC explained that my body was having trouble draining the toxins from the die off I’d just went through. She suggested I do some lymph brushing. Which I did, along with the acupuncture, and I felt much better the next morning. I’m not done yet, I’m not sure if I’ll ever be “cured”, but I know that I’m going to feel better one day."

1,Able900,310," Hello, Glowstone, welcome to the forum.I was a bit alarmed though to find my stools are now floatingThere are several reason for floating stools.  Lack of bile is possible, especially with a Candida infestation. Another reason is if you’re not breaking down and absorbing fats properly. If you eat too many fatty foods this can happen, also if pancreatic problems or gastrointestinal infections are present. However, in your case there’s a good chance that it’s caused by a lack of bile since it sounds like you have a somewhat advanced case of Candida albicans overgrowth and this is so common with Candida.I’m wondering if the big kills going to happen just as Im feeling better?…. What do you mean by, “the big kill”? Able"

0,DND2005,312,"Here is some background. Candida problems started back in college. Student health center kept treating what they thought was an ear infection with multiple rounds of antibiotics. Turns out it was a tumor in my middle ear. This was back in the early Ninties. Tumor was removed and I was stuck with major candida issues. Found the book “The Yeast Connection” and started the recommended diet. The ENT was willing to put me on Nystatin. Thought I got everything under control and stopped the diet and antifungals. Fast forward to my late twenties and I started to feel bad again. Don’t remember what the triggers were honestly, but a therapist recommended I start to see a doctor who also operated a wholistic practice using a Bio Meredian machine. Of course what showed up was systemic candida. Went on long term use of prescription antifungals for at least 2 years. Candida never went totally away because I never made a lifestyle change to my diet. Fast forward again, two years ago, went on HCG diet to lose 75 lbs. Now that I think about it the restricted diet really mimics the candida diet. I think I not only lost the weight but also killed off a lot of candida as well. Over these last two years, I have finally made the commitment, and made a lifestyle change with my eating. I have been almost 95% free of gluten, starches, carbs, dairy and sugar and the 75 lbs that I lost. Fast forward again to March this year. I ended up with double ear infections. Three different major antibiotics and 20 days later I am a walking candida bomb. Doctor wrote me a script for Diflucan just in case. Used up two of the four doses of Diflucan to clear up a vaginal yeast infection, but did not pay close attention to my diet. Well, the sugar and carb cravings hit I started eating poorly and I started to feel worse and worse. A good friend directed me to this forum. I started the detox/cleanse on May 20th. Following is what I am taking and eating for the detox/cleanse: Solgar Chelated Molybdenum (900 mg a day) Flora Alcohol-Free Swedish Bitters (2 tbls a day) Detox Drink – once to twice a day (Organic Aloe Vera Juice, Organic Chia Seeds, Bentonite) – switched water for AVJ due to constipation Natures Answer Alcohol Free Milk Thistle (6 ml a day) Nettle Leaf Tea when I think about it One to one and a half gallons of water/lemon water a day Food is all organic and includes: avocados, mixed greens, celery, cucumbers, all summer squash, fennel, garlic, ginger, beet greens, swiss chard, bok choi, raw sauerkraut, black olives, hard boiled eggs 2-4 per day, Celtic sea salt and pepper, coconut oil to saute, and olive oil. After two weeks of eating this way, I added 8 Tbs of coconut oil.  Week 4 (this week) – I added NutriBiotic GSE (can I just say YUCK) 10 drops in water 2x’s a day So after all this, I thought I would be past the cleanse. Unfortunately, I still am still dealing with mild constipation, oral thrush and acne on my neck. So my theory is that once I am able to get my digestion working and my constipation, thrush and acne cleared up, then I would move on to the diet phase and start adding in the probiotics. To be honest, I am scared to add protein due to my digestion and constipation issues. But I am craving meat in a big bad way! I feel like I am on the right track and the forum information has been invaluable to me up to this point. The questions I have right now: 1. Should I go ahead and take the last two doses of Diflucan while I am on the cleanse? 2. What is causing me to gag on the coconut oil?  3. Should I eliminate the beet greens, sauerkraut, fennel and black olives until after I start the strict diet? Thanks!"
1,Able900,312,"Hello, Deanna, welcome to the forum. The answers to your questions are below.1. Should I go ahead and take the last two doses of Diflucan while I am on the cleanse? After two weeks of eating this way, I added 8 Tbs of coconut oil. Week 4 (this week) – I added NutriBiotic GSE (can I just say YUCK) 10 drops in water 2x’s a dayYou’re not exactly on the cleanse any longer since you’ve added another antifungal (GSE) in addition to the coconut oil, but you were on the cleanse long enough. Other than possibly coconut oil, antifungals aren’t added until the cleanse is completed since they add more toxins to your body for it to eliminate.2. What is causing me to gag on the coconut oil?Probably the terrible taste; most of us did the same. You may or may not get used to it; I didn’t, but you can accept that you need to take it all the same.3. Should I eliminate the beet greens, sauerkraut, fennel and black olives until after I start the strict diet? So after all this, I thought I would be past the cleanse. Unfortunately, I still am still dealing with mild constipation, oral thrush and acne on my neck.

To be honest, I am scared to add protein due to my digestion and constipation issues. But I am craving meat in a big bad way! You need to be on the diet and obtaining more nutrients. Constipation is normal, in fact so is diarrhea when you have a Candida infestation and are treating it. Don’t let this keep you from obtaining the food and nutrients you need during this time.  As the Candida are destroyed, the toxins are released into your body, this will cause die-off effects which can be in the form of acne as well as mouth thrush. What I’m saying is, you may continue to have these for a few months to come so you can’t wait for them to clear up before you start the diet. You asked for the strict diet earlier and have it now, so just follow it as it’s written and you’ll be on the right path. Add some organic eggs for protein and forget about meat; make the oat bran bread recipe in the recipe section as well since it can probably help with constipation. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst746_Coconut-Flour-Bread.aspx Also, read the following link for the acceptable remedies for constipation. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1098_Constipation-Remedies.aspx Let us know if you have other questions.

Telling people about your diet can only lead to anxiety because they won’t understand. You didn’t tell us exactly what you’re eating, so I’m guessing due to no other information.

2,Javizy,313,"Cutting down on carbs takes a lot of adjustment, and if you’ve gone very low carb (<50g/day), you've probably dropped into ketosis. Some people are fine with it, but others develop a glucose deficiency as a result of poor metabolism or liver function, and candida can feed on ketones, so there's no benefit to it. If you eat about 60g of carbs a day you can stay out of ketosis, and provide enough glucose for your brain and muscles to function. The rest of your cells will happily run on fat, which is where you should get the rest of your calories (after adequate protein intake). By the way, you should introduce your friend to the magic of gluconeogenesis, or maybe remind him people don't die while fasting."
0,cerenurt,314,"Hi, I joined this forum a little while ago and just wanted to share my experience so far. I’m sure I have leaky gut syndrome with yeast overgrowth. As a kid I had strep throat and ear infections a lot, and therefore was constantly on antibiotics. As a teen up until my late 20s, I drank at least one soda a day and ate very unhealthily (lots of desserts and carbs!) I also smoked and didn’t exercise. In my early 20s I developed psoriasis, tinnitus (possibly because I also have psoriasis in my ears), and began to get chronic vaginal yeast infections. A few years later I starting getting chronic urinary tract infections. One summer when I was about 27, I got strep throat 3 times in a row! By the time I was 30 I developed a much healthier life style, quit smoking and started exercising, and stopped getting sick so much. But I didn’t realize the candida/diet connection until I was about 34. (I’m 39 now.) Since then I’ve made an effort to eliminate gluten, sugar, alcohol from my diet, and actually have been pretty good about it. But, not having any faith in a permanent cure I often had a “why bother” attitude with my diet, would let little things slack and have not been consistent. While the psoriasis is always there, it varies in intensity depending on how good I’ve been with my diet. I only get yeast infections if I cheat with desserts and carbs for a period of a few weeks or so. I’ve gotten the strict diet from Able, and so far have just been whittling down my eating habits and will try to go as far as I can with this very strict diet. So far I have eliminated ALL sugars, including fruit, which is a first for me. (This also includes no cheating with condiments, store bought salad dressings that have sugar, etc.) I’ve also eliminated all gluten and am eating just brown rice and oat bran as my carbs. I’m taking a strong probiotic and drinking Kefir. I tried cutting out caffeine, but I have been WIPED OUT and not able to think clearly since last Friday, I think this is because of the total elimination of fruit, which I used to eat a lot of! I’m a librarian and have to think on my feet, and have been finding it impossible to do my job without something to pick me up and get my brain going. I’m even wondering if I have some kind of hypoglycemic/blood sugar issue because I’ve been feeling so TIRED and out of it. I’m hoping this is die-off instead, and bought some Molybdenum and Milk Thistle to see if that will help. All the other stuff, the coconut oil, antifungals, total elimination of caffeine, etc, will just have to wait I think, until I can slowly acclimate to this diet. I need to at least get used to the lack of sugar first. Otherwise I don’t know how I’d be able to function mentally! 🙂 My ultimate goal is to get rid of the yeast overgrowth, heal the leaky gut, and maybe one day be able to eat a cheeseburger again (with the bun!) or an occasional dessert without my body rebelling against me. Oh, and another part of my healing routine is affirmations that I say to myself every night. If anything, this at least keeps me motivated and on track, but also makes me believe that complete healing is possible. 🙂"
1,raster,314,"I highly recommend trying out chamomile tea as a replacement for coffee. It has a variety of benefits, but the main ones are that it perks you up if you steep it longer than 8 mins (and drink 2-3 cups), its antifungal, and it improves bowel movements. I am sure there are more but it single-handedly helped me get over caffeine. You might also consider green tea as a transitional drink between the coffee and chamomile…it surprisingly has a variety of benefits as well (anti-oxident, anti-inflammatory, etc). The caffeine is its only downside but its quite a bit weaker the coffee (be sure not to steep it too long or it’ll get too strong). -raster"

3,cerenurt,314,"Week 2(ish) Update About a week after eliminating fruit the fatigue went away. But I still get tired sometimes and have been feeling so cranky–I mean constantly–since starting this protocol! I’ve been really surprised that I have no desire for the sugar, fruit, dairy, corn, and gluten I’ve eliminated. My psoriasis improved drastically for about the first week, but then came back some. Perhaps because of die-off, but flaring up before getting better is often the natural healing pattern of psoriasis anyway, so we’ll see… I’m still experimenting with the diet. For the past week a typical day looks like this: Morning: -1/2 hour before eating, Lemon water with 4 Slippery Elm capsules to help heal leaky gut (as opposed to Slippery Elm tea which is a pain to make) -SF722 -2 eggs and sauteed veggies or salad and/or oat bran -Green tea -Vitamins, molybdenum, Milk Thistle supplement Afternoon -Cheating with 1 can of Stevia Soda (will replace soon with green tea and seltzer water) -1/2 hour before eating, 4 Slippery Elm capsules -SF722 -Chicken and steamed veggies and/or lentil soup with salad Evening -1/2 hour before eating, 4 Slippery Elm capsules -SF722 -Chicken or an egg and steamed veggies and/or salad Before Bed -Chamomile tea (will soon be replaced with Saffron tea, which is recommended to heal leaky gut…just waiting for my order to come in) -MegaFlora Probiotic I use coconut oil to cook and add a dollop of it to meals here and there. I also have Nettle Tea which I’m going to try soon. I’m considering seeking out a naturopath or alternative doctor. This diet certainly isn’t any fun, but the fact that my ear canals are almost clear of psoriasis keeps me VERY motivated! (Before they were CONSTANTLY itching and flaky with dried skin.)"

I’ve also been playing around with the idea of just having all “veggie and egg” days once in a while (when I don’t have to work). I understand that, and in fact, most people have this fear while they’re on the diet. If it helps, eggs, kefir, and Greek yogurt were my only sources of protein for many months while on the treatment, and I suffered no negative problems because of this. My nails continued to grow as they normally had, and as soon as the infestation begin to subside, my hair growth and thickness begin to change in a huge way. These were all clues that I was not suffering from a protein deficiency. Let me see if I can explain why I believe you would benefit by eliminating even half of your meals that contain chicken protein. The digestive tract is the focal point for most illnesses; these include Candida infestations as well as psoriasis. Poor digestion almost always includes incomplete protein digestion, and this is especially true with a Candida overgrowth. When this is happening every day it leads to the creation of even more toxins added to the ones which the Candida create. In addition to ammonia, the new toxins that are added to your body are polyamines which are known to contribute to excessive skin proliferation. Along with the overgrowth of these microbes is often an imbalance or a deficiency of the friendly flora or bacteria in the intestines, which normally help the liver to detoxify the body, and as we all know, the liver function is of crucial importance since it’s the body’s main filtering system for toxins. What I’m saying is, the animal protein is not helping either your psoriasis or your Candida overgrowth and making both more difficult to cure both. Able"

I think Raster’s point is that you shouldn’t obsess about sugar and carbs if you’re eating foods that contribute towards the diet, like kefir and yoghurt. Counting carbs is stressful and limiting to your diet. Thinking in terms of food can be more helpful. Cow’s milk is about 4.5% sugar, which is the only carb it contains. Rice milk is 4% sugar and 5% starch. It also has no protein and much less fat. You’d be better off eating a croissant than drinking a glass of rice milk."

11,last12know,315,hi there – you should be eating plain yogurt – no sugar – if you are eating sugar you are feeding the yeast.
0,survivor619,316,"just new to this site. does anyone know if there is a way to do this candida treatment plan without totally eliminating alcohol? i know that might sound selfish or what not, but really though……so many social situations involving drinking. i am not an alcoholic, i dont crave alcohol but i find it hard to avoid alochol if i am in a situation where friends are drinking. i just dont like feeling left out. is there a way to flush out all of the alcohol before it gets broken down into sugar or whatever. we are all only human here right. i mean i know so many people who drink and consume sweet foods all of the time and they dont have candida overgrowth and if we are on a strong dose of antifungals and taking all of the necessary probiotics and exerciseing, contrast showers etc (as i am doing) why cant i socially drink. if the yeast cells are dieing rapidly, how are they able to feed on the alcohol anyways if its just an occasional thing and you drink lots of water to flush it out. im just thinking aloud here, somebody please help. thanks people"
1,cerenurt,316,"My feeling is that alcohol would negate any work put into doing the protocol. This is just from my experience, but ingesting anything that “feeds the candida” (sugar, gluten, alcohol) just makes my symptoms a lot worse. I haven’t been able to beat candida or leaky gut syndrome yet, and part of the reason is because for years I’ve been constantly cheating with the diet. Drinking alcohol would be kind of like trying to beat cancer but continuing to smoke. However, I know from experience how difficult it is to stay on such a strict diet, especially in social situations. I have a friend who doesn’t completely understand my situation (and apparently doesn’t want to) who is constantly telling me “you can cheat” when we go out to eat, so I don’t really hang out with her anymore. I’ve pretty much come to terms with not having much of a social life while on the strict diet! So, if you really need to have that drink, the only thing I can suggest is to pay careful attention to your body, perhaps not drink at all for a week or two, and compare your symptoms are to when you do drink. Then you can decide for yourself if your body can handle it and if it is worth it."
2,raster,316,"Drinking is likely the reason you got here in the first place and doesn’t have any benefit to getting healthy. These are some basic reasons not to drink: -It damages the kidneys and liver which detox the body and do a lot of important things. If you have damaged kidneys and liver, you likely won’t heal as much as you’d like to (from my experience). These organs need to be in as good shape as possible to heal from candida’s toxins. -It is inflammatory and doesn’t contribute to the gut flora. -Drinks such as wine and beer contain yeast which is very detrimental to your health; its like opening windows in a house fire. -The sugar feeds candida if it exists within the drink. -There isn’t anything positive about them other than the social aspect of drinking. -It is not good for the oxygen in the body. -Drinking destroys brain cells. How long do you plan on being on the candida diet? I’ve been on it for a year myself and just recently drank for the first time in 14 months. I am mostly symptom free. I am getting married this weekend and had a bachelor party; I basically was not hungover because my liver and kidneys are in very good shape. If you are getting hungover it means your liver and kidneys are damaged from my experience…I used to get hungover from just 1-2 drinks in the past. I used to rage it all of the time and drank 3-4 days a week. Its hard adjusting to it, but I’ve learned that my friends don’t have much going on with them other than partying. -raster"

My understanding was that yeast cant feed candida? Or is there another reason why it is bad for our health? On topic: I agree with everything of the above. You dont want alcohol on an anti candida protocol, especially when there is leaky gut involved. I doesnt neccesarily feed candida as sugar does, but the other reasons are enough. If you decide you need alcohol, dont go for beer or wine. The least detrimental I have found is (diluted) vodka (with lemon juice)."
0,chele,317,"I am new to this forum and new to the whole concept of systemic candida. It was just one week ago today that I came to the diagnosis and was able to convince my gastroenterologist that what we’ve been dealing with all along has been candida. So, here’s the story (warning: this is going to be a long post). As a kid I was always sick. I can’t count how many times I had strep throat. My sophomore year in college I was on antibiotics almost continuously for the full year before they finally decided to remove my tonsils. Then, when I was 24, after taking a course of antibiotics for yet another case of strep throat, I got clostridium difficile. All throughout my 30s I was sick alot–with sinus infections and the like. But I just assumed it was because I was busy with 4 kids and running my own business. However, in the last year or so things have gotten significantly worse. I have had IBS for 20 years but the symptoms worsened last summer and I stopped going to the gym in August because of the diarrhea. I was extremely tired all the time and, even after napping, felt very fatigued (however, I had a lot of trouble sleeping at night, even with prescription sleeping pills). My periods also started coming just 2 1/2 weeks apart, were very heavy and were 8-9 days in duration. I also noticed I could no longer tolerate alcohol at all. In fact, last Sept. while flying home from a business trip I had a wine spritzer on the plane and was absolutely plastered. I noticed some time last year that my tongue was white, which I thought was odd but thought it was just something I had eaten and that it would eventually go away. I also developed nodules on my thyroid and resulting hypothyroidism. Then in January the body aches and severe diarrhea kicked in. I was diagnosed with bursitis and given steroids. I had a colonoscopy/endoscopy and, aside from some irritation, I was told I was “fine.” It was, however, discovered that I am lactose and fructose intolerant. And then, in March I was given a hydrogen breath test which was positive for small intestine bacterial overgrowth (which I am now wondering if it was candida all along–???). So, I was prescribed a course of antibiotics which did nothing to help. When I reported to my gastroenterologist that I was still having 8-12 loose stools per day, she told me that my problem was just IBS and that I needed to learn how to manage my stress and to “go exercise.” Long story short: I went through 2 more doctors and several more rounds of antibiotics (doubled up, actually) before I realized something was very very wrong. Fortunately, through my own research I was able to figure this out and, fortunately, the doctor I have now recognizes this is undoubtably candida. HOWEVER, the last week has been a nightmare. Tuesday, day one of detox, I ended up in the ER, where, of course, the doctor didn’t believe for one second I had candida (why are the doctors so oblivious to this???). Ever since then I have been in bed nearly all the time with severe body aches, headache, EXTREME fatigue, ringing in the ears, weakness, dizziness, fuzziness (feeling detached), diarrhea (although this is gradually improving). I am taking Diflucan prescribed by my gastroenterologist, following the strict diet, and am taking probiotics (also recommended by my doctor). Am I doing all the right things? Is what I’m feeling normal? I’m just worried because my husband is back to work tomorrow, the kids start swimming lessons, we’ve got 2 dance recitals, vacations, etc. coming up this month and I’m overwhelmed at the thought of trying to do any of it. Right now all I can do is eat and sleep. Is there anyone out there that can help??"
1,Able900,317,"Is what I’m feeling normal? What you’re feeling is perfectly normal if you’re going about the treatment backwards, which you are. Hopefully, if you pay attention to what we tell you, you’re about to start taking a supplement called Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate which will relieve your symptoms. Your problem is, you should have started taking this supplement days before starting the cleanse, the diet or taking any type of supplement including the probiotic and Diflucan; you should address your gastroenterologist as Mr. Hitler from now on for the atrocity he has inflicted on your body. The idiot. The experience you’re having is the result of aldehyde toxins poisoning your body. The poison is expelled by dying Candida caused by the Diflucan, probiotic, and the diet. So now you know what it feels like to be poisoned and not die, but which you had. You’re in the states, so Molybdenum will be easy for you to find. Call around to your local health or vitamin stores and ask if they carry (precisely) Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate. If they tell you “no, but we have plain Molybdenum which is probably the same thing” hang up on whoever is telling you this fairy tale and call another store. Stores belonging to the Vitamin Shoppe chain carry this mineral. But if you can’t find it locally, you can order it online from Amazon and other stores. Meanwhile, drink more water than you’ve ever drank before to wash the toxins from your body as they are poisoning your liver and kidneys as you’re reading this. Take a sauna or sit in a hot tub of water upon completion of reading this post and do that several times a day to help the toxins leave your body. In other words, sweat. Drink pure lemon water without sugar if you can to flush out the kidneys and your body in general of the toxins. Most importantly, stop taking the Diflucan and probiotics now.  Talk to us again after you’ve been taking the Molybdenum for one week, or any time in between if you need to. In addition, read the posts that are linked below because if you’re going to help yourself you’ll need the information that the posts contain.

2,chele,317,"Able, Thank you so much for your reply. I plan to make some calls tonight to see if any of the local stores have Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate. I’m hoping that maybe Whole Foods will have it and my husband will go pick it up for me since I am still unable to drive. How long should I take it for? When should I start taking the probiotics again? Another thing that I am quite concerned about is that I believe I may be developing a urinary tract infection. I really don’t want to take any more antibiotics and drinking cranberry juice is obviously not an option. Is there anything else that I can take to treat the infection without the use of antibiotics? I really don’t want to go down that road again……"
3,Able900,317,"How long should I take it for? (molybdenum) As long as you’re having physical die-off symptoms. This is usually between 2 and 5 weeks, but can be less or even more. This is something you have to test to know whether or not you need it. You can lower the amount by one pill after a few weeks to see if you experience a die-off reaction, but for the time being I would definitely stay on three pills, 250 mcg each, taken three times a day, continue to drink lots and lots of water, and soak in a hot tub or take saunas every day.When should I start taking the probiotics again? Before you start back on the probiotics, let’s look at your situation again in about two weeks after we get those toxins out of the way. The same goes for Diflucan; just hold off on that indefinitely as it’s not going to cure the infestation anyway. Meanwhile, if you stay on the diet, this is going to be destroying enough Candida for you to deal with.Another thing that I am quite concerned about is that I believe I may be developing a urinary tract infection. I really don’t want to take any more antibiotics and drinking cranberry juice is obviously not an option. Is there anything else that I can take to treat the infection without the use of antibiotics? I really don’t want to go down that road again…… UTI’s are so normal during a Candida infestation I sometimes think it should be listed as the main symptom, especially among women. Purchase some cranberry extract capsules and follow the instructions on the label for taking them. Also purchase vitamin C, any type – any price since hey don’t have to be expensive to work. Purchse the vitamin C pillsm not capsules. They should contain either 1000 or 500 mg. Take 1000 mg three times a day, morning, noon, and night. These two supplements are the best supplements to take in order to hold off a urinary tract infection. Let us know if you have other concerns, please. Able"
4,chele,317,"I’m so sorry for all the questions. I am really trying to find help locally but am striking out. I do have an appointment today with a chiropractor but am not sure how much she will know. And I tried to get in to see a homeopathic doctor but she isn’t taking new clients until November. And, obviously, I can’t wait that long. Anyway, Able, I did stop taking the Diflucan and the probiotics as you recommended and some of the “brain fog” has lifted a bit. However, the diarrhea and headaches have worsened. Diarrhea has always been a very big problem for me (I was going 8-12 times per day from January through just last week) so I really don’t want to go down that road again. I think the probiotics were helping on that front. Why did you recommend discontinueing the probiotics? I’m thinking that, in my case, I should start taking them again. But if there are legitimate reasons not to please let me know. I sincerely trust your expertise. Also, I am really struggling with food options and sleep. I have been sticking to the diet. It is bland and boring but, honestly, I am in so much pain and distress I really don’t care. I would eat mud at this point if that’s what it took to get better. But the problem is that, with the IBS, food intolerances, and nausea, I struggle daily with what to put in my body that either won’t come out the other end, cause abdominal distress, or extreme gagging. I’m not getting much sleep at night because of this. I can’t sleep without food in my stomach (it’s been this way for the past few years. I always thought it was because of breastfeeding but now that I’ve weaned them all I’m wondering if it was candida). But trying to find the right foods to make me feel full has been difficult (any suggestions?). So, I only sleep for 4-5 hours and then I’m up, usually with diarrhea before I even have breakfast. I am hungry throughout the day and would love to have options for quick, easy snacks that I can grab without having to prepare anything. I know nuts are an option but, with the IBS, they often give me diarrhea. Hard boiled eggs are another option but right now they make me very nauseous. Anyway, I am really struggling and would so appreciate any advice or suggestions. I still can’t drive because of the dizziness so I’d like to make one big grocery list and send my husband tomorrow night (he can’t go tonight because of dance class, baseball practice, etc.–life must go on, even if mommy has candida). :o( Finally, I have called around and cannot find molybdenum amino acid chelate anywhere locally. I’m thinking maybe we could order it on Amazon (?). If so, which one would you recommend? Thanks again, Able, for your replies and for all your help.

I eat snacks/food like museli, yoghurt, chamomile tea, apple cider, No fried food, no french fries I’m a man at in late twenties now, and only recently aware and discover I may have candida overgrowth, by trying the spit test and having the symptoms. Have not done any blood/stool test. My diet mainly consist of milk ,chicken, eggs, lotsa rice/noodle (in asia) and coffee (2 cups a day min) On top of that, I had supplements to keep me running with my demanding job, which I think one of it was a ‘energy pill’ (consist of high caffeine, ginseng, ginko) Now the symptons I have presently are fatigue, brain fog, poor memory/concentration, unexplained constipation and diarrhea in the same week, abdominal pains, cotton cheese thrush like on tongue and beneath foreskin. I went to the doctor to diagnose , who couldn’t gave me a clear verdict and assume I do not have a yeast infection but prescribe me 1 week of Nizoral (anti fungal pill) if I ever think i have it in my intestine.  I started to take the medicine and started the candida diet at the same time, by cutting carbs (rice) and sugar and caffeine totally. Breakfast : 3 eggs + salad + yoghurt w almond nuts (add probiotic powder) Lunch : Salad + fruits or fruit juice (strawberrry/wheatgrass/greenapple ..etc) Snack : Almond nuts/ detox tea, chamomile tea Dinner: Salmon and broccoli  I may use grapeseed oil, mixed dried herbs, fresh thyme, black pepper whenever I get to prepare my meals at home At the same time ,I choose organic supplies if I can except for meat (not available here) Day 1 – 4 I experience blood shot eyes, and my face look dull and tired, sleepy and had to shut down to nap while work (perhaps lack of caffeine) * Add supplements, Garlic pills, Pau D’arco, Fish oil omega 3 & 6, chorophyll, 3 bil probiotic 4 strains + korean ginseng & spirulina occasionally Day 5-7 My stool are whole green due to abundant of greens + chorophyll supplement. Passing motion now feel … different , no constipation so far One of those day, my stools made the bowl water .. cloudy with mini pods floating on top (could be parasite or just undigested dried herbs that I ate) Day 8-9 Finished my Nizoral, did my spit test, it was the same, cloudy saliva at the bottom From my toilet bowl watching.. stool appears to have white stuff ,size of a 5 mm attached to them.  Brain fog and poor concentration still haunts me at work with constant mistakes made 🙁 Desperate for a meal, I fix my meal at the sushi deli with a “cha soba, with sashimi” Taste so good ! .. opps, But I just ate *soy sauce and *wheat flour in them Its so difficult to maintain such a diet in a asia country where everyone eat rice/bread/noodle with greens/meat stir fried with seasoning, soy sauce,sugar. A healthy organic store that sells salad and juice cost me 3 times the price of a regular meal and sadly not filling enough. I find difficulty to have lunch with colleagues or any social gathering that involves having coffee/drinks/heavy dinner. Starting to look like a freak when I am only eating shell fish, spinach, salad but not pasta, rice . Very depressing and felt wanting to quit my job to start a real cleansing from the start.

My diet mainly consist of milk ,chicken, eggs, lotsa rice/noodle (in asia) and coffee (2 cups a day min) On top of that, I had supplements to keep me running with my demanding job, which I think one of it was a ‘energy pill’ (consist of high caffeine, ginseng, ginko) Now the symptons I have presently are fatigue, brain fog, poor memory/concentration, unexplained constipation and diarrhea in the same week, abdominal pains, cotton cheese thrush like on tongue and beneath foreskin. I went to the doctor to diagnose , who couldn’t gave me a clear verdict and assume I do not have a yeast infection but prescribe me 1 week of Nizoral (anti fungal pill) if I ever think i have it in my intestine.  I started to take the medicine and started the candida diet at the same time, by cutting carbs (rice) and sugar and caffeine totally.  Breakfast : 3 eggs + salad + yoghurt w almond nuts (add probiotic powder) Lunch : Salad + fruits or fruit juice (strawberrry/wheatgrass/greenapple ..etc) Snack : Almond nuts/ detox tea, chamomile tea Dinner: Salmon and broccoli  I may use grapeseed oil, mixed dried herbs, fresh thyme, black pepper whenever I get to prepare my meals at home At the same time ,I choose organic supplies if I can except for meat (not available here) Day 1 – 4 I experience blood shot eyes, and my face look dull and tired, sleepy and had to shut down to nap while work (perhaps lack of caffeine) * Add supplements, Garlic pills, Pau D’arco, Fish oil omega 3 & 6, chorophyll, 3 bil probiotic 4 strains + korean ginseng & spirulina occasionally Day 5-7 My stool are whole green due to abundant of greens + chorophyll supplement. Passing motion now feel … different , no constipation so far One of those day, my stools made the bowl water .. cloudy with mini pods floating on top (could be parasite or just undigested dried herbs that I ate) Day 8-9 Finished my Nizoral, did my spit test, it was the same, cloudy saliva at the bottom From my toilet bowl watching.. stool appears to have white stuff ,size of a 5 mm attached to them.  Brain fog and poor concentration still haunts me at work with constant mistakes made 🙁 Desperate for a meal, I fix my meal at the sushi deli with a “cha soba, with sashimi” Taste so good ! .. opps, But I just ate *soy sauce and *wheat flour in them  Its so difficult to maintain such a diet in a asia country where everyone eat rice/bread/noodle with greens/meat stir fried with seasoning, soy sauce,sugar. A healthy organic store that sells salad and juice cost me 3 times the price of a regular meal and sadly not filling enough. I find difficulty to have lunch with colleagues or any social gathering that involves having coffee/drinks/heavy dinner. Starting to look like a freak when I am only eating shell fish, spinach, salad but not pasta, rice . Very depressing and felt wanting to quit my job to start a real cleansing from the start. At the same time, I can’t resume my gym routine and go back to gaining muscle mass due to lack of energy now. I have lost 2-3 kg of whatever water retention, old stool, fat/muscle but I dont like how i look now. Did you have a question?"

0,PhilAJ,320,"Just woken up to Day 4 of my detox/cleanse and I must say I don’t feel too bad. Was expecting to feel hungry – but not too bad. I did throw in a parsnip – baked into crisps – last night, they were very nice and broke the boredom of the ‘gunk’ drink. Only symptoms so far is some bad heartburn at bedtime after drinking the Liver flush drink (ginger & garlic), and i’m starting to feel quite tired, I guess because of lack of any protein and carbs. Question is – how will I know I’ve done enough – and ready to go to the Diet (stage 2)?

2,PhilAJ,320,"Thanks Able Yes read the Protocol, and that cleanse link, maybe I misunderstood the first time. I have just been sticking to the 3 drinks – and not had anything else for 4 days (apart from the parsnip). Wasn’t sure if I should feel something happening yet.

0,PhilAJ,321,"Hi to all I’m from UK and have just self diagnosed that I have Candida Overgrowth – and have been looking for a support forum when I found this one. The reasons I think i have it; I get very very bloated after eating – especially after 1st cup of tea of a morning. Also have bad reflux and heartburn; always tired; and started to get some patches of ezcema on my arms and underarms. Over the last year or so I find I also have low moods and no energy. This bloaty belly is getting me depressed to0 and am sick of guys asking me ‘whens the baby due” on the course. When reading the possible causes, the ones that jumped out at me were; Little exercise; stress (work for myself ..so); taking too many caffeine based tablets (I’ve been addicted to Solpadeine and caffeine based pills for 15 years); probably too many sweet things to eat, too much alcohol etc etc. Do these sound familiar to anyone ? Ok well hopefully today is the first day to recovery and no more bloated belly! I’ve bought some Bentonite Clay & Psyllium Husk; made myself a big batch of broth, and today so far have had 2 cups of the clay & husk micture and 2 bowls of broth – as per stage 1 of ‘The Cleanse’ Just hope I can keep going with this thru this week..and then the stage 2 beyond. Anyone else at this early stage – it would be really good to be able to share experiences and get support from others. Any comments of support or help much appreciated. Thanks Phil"

You certainly don’t have to continue the cleanse if it doesn’t suit your lifestyle. For example, I didn’t do the cleanse at all other than having lemon water for a month or so with the strict diet, and I still managed to come to a complete cure of the infestation. The “stricter version” of the website’s diet is actually a type of cleanse, and this is especially true if you can last a few weeks before adding chicken or fish to the allowed foods which is what a lot of members try to do including myself. You can also continue drinking the detox drink which is on the “safer cleanse” during the diet and this will help to eliminate toxins. I wouldn’t use the detox on the website which contains psyllium.

0,Croc,322,"Hello everyone 🙂 I’m glad I decided to write on this forum. Please let me introduce myself. I’m 24 years old man (feels more like a boy though). I’m 186 cm (73 in) tall and my weight is 73 kg (161 lbs.). My weight used to be smaller usually (about 6 kg / 13 lbs. less), but I started to care about eating good breakfasts and I gained some. When I was a child, I was pretty thin and pale. Oh, and I’m Polish, living in Poland. Just in case somebody’s surprised with my poor English. Forgive me, that’s my second language 🙂 Okay, now let’s go straight to the point: why am I here? I have several symptoms which may or may not be connected. I spent much time and much money in my life trying to feel better or at least know what’s wrong. It didn’t work. Here what has been confirmed with exams: 1) Acid reflux and bile reflux – gastroscopy 2) Streptococcus aureus – tongue smear That’s it for now. Yes, I’ve got reflux, but I don’t think it’s crucial factor of how I feel. So here are my symptoms: 1) Lack of energy – that’s the big one. Most of the time I feel very dull and tired. I like sport, but many activities I have problem with starting. It’s difficult for me to start making food, for example. I need take naps a lot, especially after coming back home. I love naps and that’s like a relief for mine physical comfort. 2) Pressure and nervousness at stomach area – that’s most mysterious of my symptoms. I have no idea what causes it. It feels like my stomach is pushing my diagraphm or something like that. It worst when I’m standing and best when I’m laying on my bed. After some time of taking naps I realized that one of reasons I love them is that it makes this pressure weaker. My stomach area is “nervous”. I used to go on the massages and masseur couldn’t touch it with cold hands, because I reacted like I got electric shock or something like that. 3) Stinky mucus in my mouth – especially after eating some types of food. Products with large amounts of sugar make me have mucus in mouth. My breath is not good then. I’m able to spit some of this mucus. It’s white (sometimes greenish, brownish or yellow when I’m sick) and it tastes salty. It’s very thick too. 4) Symptoms similar to hypoglycemia – especially during stressful situations. I’m turning shaky, my hands, feet and nose are freezingly cold. I recently read much about hypoglycemia and its influence on psychics. That’s what I experience, but let me write it in the next point. 5) Psychical problems – that makes me very sad. I can’t feel pleasure of meeting with friends because of that. I realized that – probably – even small adrenaline amount makes me very distracted, nervous and dull-minded. I cannot focus on friends, I think only about my symptoms and want to quit. I’ve read that’s called “flee instinct” and can be caused by low sugar level. When I eat lots of sugar, next day I feel anxious. I used to think that it’s kind of neurosis, but now I doubt it. 6) Breathing problems – my breath is very shallow and I think that’s connected with points 2) and 5). Breathing is not comfortable for me due to pressure and sometimes I feel like I have to force myself to breath. Ufff… that’s all I guess. What is positive on my way is the fact that I changed a lot of my lifestyle because of these symptoms. I started to eat better, drink better and sleep better. About 7 years ago mucus was my problem number #1, but now it’s not so bad. I learned to control it just by the way I eat. I totally put off white bread and fruit juices and they were very popular in my diet several years ago. Now I try to eat less sugar, but chocolate is like a drug for me. I can eat 200g of chocolate at once, but then I feel bad and my breath stinks. What is strange, when I avoid sugar, the pressure on my stomach is much harder. No idea why. All right, I think that’s enough for my first post here. Pretty long, huh? I know, but I didn’t want to miss anything, every information can be crucial. What I’d like to achieve? I’d like to feel better, keep my mind opened, be relaxed and have more energy to realize my ideas with success. Even writing this post was hard for me, but I’m happy I succeed. Today I haven’t eaten any sweeties and tried some garlic. Now (we have early night in Poland) I have very little mucus (hurray), but stomach pressure is very strong. Thank you so much for reading."
1,raster,322,Is the Streptococcus what causes “strept throat?” Just wondering about it because I used to get strept a whole bunch. -raster
2,Javizy,322,"It sounds like a mixture of poor diet and stress, two things that reinforce each other, have caused most of your problems. Have you been taking antibiotics for the strep? Let me guess: you don’t do any exercise? The first thing anyone with GERD should be tested for is h. pylori. Stress is linked to this problematic bug. If you’ve been taking antacids and eating lots of starch, then it may well have grown out of control. A mixture of h. pylori and antacids can lead to extremely low levels of stomach acid, which can wreak havoc on digestion, and lead to all sorts of other problems. Just resolving this could help a lot of your symptoms, but it’s likely issues have developed in the intestines too. As for your psychological problems, would you say you’re depressed? Depression is strongly linked to inflammation, and it sounds like your diet has been incredibly inflammatory. Stress are dysbiosis are also immensely inflammatory. Changing your diet, improving gut flora, reducing stress, doing moderate exercise and supplementing fish oil and vitamin D could be very helpful. Have you ever had your vitamin D serum level checked? Do you get symptoms like joint pain, skin rash or anything else noticeable? Whether or not candida is behind your problems isn’t really important. You’ll still benefit from improving your diet, balancing your gut flora, reducing stress and doing moderate exercise. It’s tough getting over the carb cravings initially, especially if you have such an emotional attachment to them, but it is possible. Your body soon adjusts to a high-fat, low-carb diet, so it’s just a case of being strong until that happens."
3,Croc,322,"Thank you guys for replies. Let me answer you. Able900 – yes, you are close 🙂 I never thought seriously about S. aureus, since I know that smears are not too accurate and S. aureus is common thing as long as it’s not overgrowth. Or maybe I’m wrong? Javizy – I see you made some assumptions about me. Here how it looks like: 1) Diet – I would never call my diet overally poor. I eat a lot better than my family and friends. I really enjoy eating good food like vegetables (and own-made vegetable juices) , natural yoghurts, white meat etc. I always tell my mom to do the same, because her habits are not so good. But, as I said, I have strong cravings for chocolate and usually cannot resist them. By average, I’d say I eat about 50-75g of chocolate products every day. A few days ago I changed it and eat much less. Now I have cold hands, feet and nose all the time 🙂 2) Stress – I learned to avoid stress as well. Due to some experiences, I had extremely stressful time when I was a kid and a teenager (like 8-17 years old). Now I’d say the only thing which is stressful for me are my symptoms. I really did good job over my stress. 3) Antibiotics – I took some antibiotics when I was a child. I was seriously ill. After that, I took them occasionally, but last time probably about 6 years ago. 4) Joint pain – Not at all. 5) Skin rash – No. 6) Anything else – I have acne from time to time, especially after eating much chocolate and when I forget to wash my face carefully. My acne was mediocre when I was teen, now is very mild to none most of time and mild occasionally (like a few small dots). EDIT I forgot to mention that from time to time my soles are yellow. I don’t know if that have anything to do with other symptoms. 7) Excercise – I don’t excercise too much, but still… better than average person. I’m trying to ride a bike like 2 hours every day. I had periods when I swam and ran a lot. The problem is that intensive excercising makes me feel very nauseous. Swimming makes me have to spit lots of mucus and feeling sick. Same with running. Bike is okay. I think it’s about “shaking” my stomach, which throws acid/mucus all over inside. When I’m riding a bike my position is stable and it doesn’t occur. Isn’t low-carb and high-protein diet dangerous for health? I’ve heard that it used to be recommended, but it was found to be really bad. I don’t know what to think."

5,Able900,322,"Hello, Croc, how’re you doing?Diet -By average, I’d say I eat about 50-75g of chocolate products every day. If you decide to treat the infestation, you should probably start getting used to the idea of living without your chocolate.Stress – I learned to avoid stress as well. Due to some experiences Good for you on accomplishing that. This will definitely prove useful during the treatment period and resulting die-off.I forgot to mention that from time to time my soles are yellow. I don’t know if that have anything to do with other symptoms. This ‘could possibly’ be a malabsorption problem or maybe you’re not getting quite enough vitamin A or the combination of the two. Do you take a vitamin A&D (combined) supplement? Another possible cause is that the soles of your feet have thickened because of the pressure on the bottoms of your feet from so two hours of bike riding a day. How long have you been doing this? Speaking of the two-hour bike ride; you may want to consider cutting the time in half during your treatment (if you decide to do this). The reason is that you’re going to be working on strengthening both your adrenals and immune system during the treatment, and rest is of ultra importance for accomplishing this.Isn’t low-carb and high-protein diet dangerous for health? I’ve heard that it used to be recommended, but it was found to be really bad. I don’t know what to think.If you’re assuming that this describes a Candida diet, you’re mistaken. A lower protein intake is more common than a higher amount since red meat and pork are not on the stricter diet because it only causes more problems with the infestation because of ammonia being released into the body when it breaks down. During the treatment and diet, your carbs will be supplied by some of the vegetables and coconut flour bread with the option of adding buckwheat, teff flour, organic oat bran, or rice bran. Let us know about your questions and concerns. Able"

If you eat that much sugar daily, you might suffer hypoglycaemia or just give in to the cravings. Try to reduce your carbs by 10-20g a day and avoid anything refined/white. Increasingly smaller servings of rice might be a good way to do it.Croc wrote: Isn’t low-carb and high-protein diet dangerous for health?

Saturated fat and cholesterol aren’t unhealthy and many of the studies that claim they are ignore the biochemical literature and are poorly designed, e.g. bacon is the “same” as pasture-fed beef, types of fat or simple starch intake aren’t considered etc. If I remember, I’ll post some links later that’ll make you feel comfortable about eating more fat.

I’m wondering if there isn’t some sort of threshold level. Some studies I saw that showed detrimental effects to the gut flora or increases in stool pH used ridiculous amounts like 200g of red meat protein, which is probably like 1kg of meat.

8,Javizy,322,"Croc, If you’re still worried about a high-fat diet, you might find the following two blogs informative. http://blog.cholesterol-and-health.com/ http://high-fat-nutrition.blogspot.co.uk/ This one’s my favourite at the moment. http://coolinginflammation.blogspot.co.uk/Able900 wrote: There are studies; I don’t recall the exact sources at this moment since the only time I spent the time thoroughly researching this was probably close to 18 months ago during the worst of my own infestation.

I see. Listening to your body is the best thing you can do really. I don’t eat much meat myself, but some days I wonder if I’m getting enough protein. That’s why I was wondering how much ammonia it would take to cause pH changes. A H. pylori overgrowth must be quite problematic for candida sufferers too, since it releases ammonia to neutralise stomach acid."
9,Croc,322,"Thank you guys 😀 Able900 – I don’t take any suplements. Honestly, I don’t believe in their quality. Maybe I’m wrong, but I believe that vitamins and microelements should be absorbed from natural sources, otherwise they don’t just work. Should I change my mind? Malabsorption sounds reasonably. I’ve never heard this name, but I was wondering whether everything I eat is metabolized properly. Why am I so slim all life? I eat pretty much normally. And why does my body reject sugar? (does it?) Okay, I’d like to share my today experiences with you now. Today I continued to avoid sugar. Here’s what I ate today: – warm mineral water with whole lemon squeezed – 2 boiled eggs for breakfast – 2 cloves of garlic for 2nd breakfast (I munched them) – salmon and spinach for dinner – glass of kefir for supper – about 2l of mineral water It may be not perfect, but at least I think I didn’t feed candida, right? 🙂 I reminded myself what happens with me when I eat garlic. It occured a few years ago when I tried candida diet, but I forgot about it. Today, again I felt something like some part of my inner mouth (under tongue, on sides) is paralyzed / burned by garlic. What can be the reason for that? Is it normal? I munch garlic and it’s very “spicy”. The good thing is that I didn’t feel cravings for chocolate today. I felt like it would be great to eat chocolate, but it wasn’t like I really have to. The bad thing is that pressure is still present. I felt pretty good before eating salmon and very bad after (nervous, nauseous). I couldn’t thing about anything else but this feeling. I’d like to tell you something new about me. I have artistic hobbies, mainly singing. People say I’m good at it, but in most cases I’m unable to do my best. Who is interested in art, knows how important thing is clear mind. My dream is to get to get it back. One more new thing about me: I react nauseous and I’m burping after everything I put in my mouth. Even mineral water makes me feel worse than before drinking. I’m not sure if my stomach isn’t in some way anatomically wrong. Generally saying, swallowing food and water is not convenient for me. Thank you again 🙂"
10,Able900,322,"Hello, Croc. There seems to be a lot to cover with your story, such as the paragraph below.Pressure and nervousness at stomach area – that’s most mysterious of my symptoms. I have no idea what causes it. It feels like my stomach is pushing my diagraphm or something like that. It worst when I’m standing and best when I’m laying on my bed. After some time of taking naps I realized that one of reasons I love them is that it makes this pressure weaker. My stomach area is “nervous”. I used to go on the massages and masseur couldn’t touch it with cold hands, because I reacted like I got electric shock or something like that.If you don’t mind, I have a few questions concerning that paragraph. First of all, I can tell you that nervousness during a Candida albicans infestation can manifest itself in many different ways; ways that most of us would never imagine unless we have the experience. Being strictly in the stomach area is something I have not heard of before, but nevertheless I certainly wouldn’t eliminate Candida as being the cause. The stomach pressure itself is what I wanted to question. When you say “pressure” the normal path would be to think gas or flatulence. But I have a feeling this isn’t what you were referring to, or is it? So if this is not your problem, I’m going to mention something that I’ve only mentioned once before on the forum and that was all of 8 months ago, so unless people just aren’t describing it as you and the other member did, apparently it isn’t that common, however, it’s still documented as a “Candida side-effect.” The problem I’m speaking of is a hiatal hernia, and according to research papers it’s a fairly normal side effect of a long standing case of a Candida albicans infestation. I considered this as a possibility because of the length of time you may have had the infestation. Another clue to a hiatal hernia being a possible cause is your statement, “I’m not sure if my stomach isn’t in some way anatomically wrong. Generally saying, swallowing food and water is not convenient for me.” It seems that one of the symptoms of an HH is a slight to strong difficulty in swallowing and “strange” feelings as the food passes down and into the intestines and stomach. Does any of this sound familiar as far as your own experiences are concerned? One explanation I remember reading as far as why Candida would cause an HH went something like – but probably not exactly like this explanation; the Candida toxins (usually in a ‘gassy’ form) sometimes creates pressure against the upper diaphragm, and pressure on that end of the stomach can force a reflux action up and into the esophagus damaging the lower esophageal sphincter and eventually creating a Hiatal Hernia. This description contains a bit of speculation on my part because I can’t remember exactly how the explanation was phrased or where I read it 8 months ago; probably in some old journal which since has been stashed into one of my four file cabinets. On another subject, you listed your diet as; -warm mineral water with whole lemon squeezed – 2 boiled eggs for breakfast – 2 cloves of garlic for 2nd breakfast (I munched them) – salmon and spinach for dinner – glass of kefir for supper – about 2l of mineral water I’m a male as well, but I’m 34 years old. I also exercise but possibly just a bit more strenuous than your 2 hour bike riding, although that’s more than enough while you still have the infestation. Since curing the infestation I now combine two basketball games a week with tennis, running, and some weight lifting and doing at least one of these every day. So I know from my past experience that, were I eating your diet, I’d be losing weight like a mad man. Are you not losing weight at all? Your diet isn’t bad at all as far as avoiding food for the Candida, however, you’re also barely feeding the beneficial bacteria being supplied by your kefir. Without food, you’ll only create a cycle of adding the bacteria via the kefir but then allowing them to die-off because of the lack of food. This way they’ll never be able to truly colonize the intestine which means you’ll never change the environment that must take place in order to turn off the growth gene of Candida yeast, therefore allowing them to continue to change into the fungal form, or Candida albicans. To supply enough food, you should be eating varied prebiotic food sources every day such as avocados, organic oat bran, brown rice bran, and at least 5 or 6 types of fibrous green vegetables a day. Please let me know what your thoughts are on the hiatal hernia possibility. Able"
11,orka1998,322,"I had to add to Able’s post as I do have personal experience with this. I was just recently diagnosed with hiatus hernia and most of the stomach symptoms you mention I do have. I often feel nausea after drinking water or eating larger meals etc. Your acid reflux could be caused by HH as well. But I do see that you had a gastroscopy (called endoscopy in US) done which this is how HH is usually diagnosed (mine was). I wonder if they missed it, it does happen if they are not looking for it. I have reflux but mine was caused by reduced size of the stomach and not closing up properly due to HH so the food and liquids come back up. I also have some chest pain and pressure which is caused by the stomach problems. Watch out for mineral water. I see you are in Poland and it may be similar as in Bosnia that all mineral water is carbonated. While it might make you feel a bit better momentarily, 2l of mineral water also burns your stomach and creates other problems, plus adds some toxins to your body as well. I would reduce it or stay away from it completely. I feel better on just plain water left in open container to get rid of chlorine. Reflux is tough if you take in a lot of liquids and don’t take enough solid food to “collect” excess water and acid as the food and acid is refluxed back up causing discomfort such as nausea and heartburn. Having a lot of liquids which is required for your treatment is tough so try following few things to make it easier: – don’t drink lots of liquids near your meals – split up your food into 5 or 6 smaller meals – when you drink liquids, drink it in smaller sips vs. gulfing down a glass of water (I used to do this) Lemon water was also tough on me as it was generating more acid and giving me more discomfort. I have it in the less water and in the middle of my meal so that food takes it in. I have my kefir with dinner and I usually have my meal, then drink lemon water with my supplements and finally drink kefir after it so kefir soothes it. Hope these few tips help you. Arijana"

Thank you so much for adding your own experience for Croc to consider using and also in diagnosing his problems. I was not aware that an HH was a problem you were having in addition to the infestation, etc. I’m very glad that you shared this with the forum, and I certainly see how you were experiencing additional problems with the infestation. My best wishes that you will see a perfectly clean health report before the year is over. Sincerely, Able"
13,Croc,322,"Able900 – yes, I lost my weight a little bit. Hiatus hernia sounds more than possible. There are 4 things giving me a relief of “stomach pressure”: 1) changing position (to sitting or laying) 2) burping 3) farting (sorry) 🙂 4) grunting – this one needs some explanation. Most of the time – as I mentioned – I’m able to spit some mucus. When I grunt, I feel like my stomach is doing something and mucus comes up to throat. Sometimes that gives me pretty big relief. I never feel really good about it, but this activity makes me feel from really bad to not so bad. orka1998 – all of this “watch out of” are making me sad. Now I have no idea what should I drink, since mineral water was the only thing I’ve been drinking for several years. I realized that it’s much easier to give any food/drink up when I feel better. When I feel strong pressure or post-sugar symptoms, I don’t control myself as well, I mean I feel like I really have to eat something bad, because that gives me a relief for a longer while. But I’m still strong and don’t touch sugar…"

Hello, Croc. I’m afraid I don’t completely understanding that paragraph, Croc, could you possibly expand on it just a tad to make it a bit clearer? Especially as far as the ‘relief’ received from bad food is concerned. Is this physical or mental relief? Also, feeling ‘sad’ is sometimes a normal feeling with looking ahead at the treatment details because you’re seeing what you need to accomplish as one big picture. But this isn’t the way it usually happens as most members take to the details on a step by step basis which changes the picture considerably. If it helps, it does get easier, and one day you realize that it’s just a different way of living your life which isn’t as painful as living with the infestation. During the treatment, at least you’re doing something towards an end. Thanks, Able"
0,gillybumbler,323,"My problems became apparent about a year ago when I had a horrible attack of vertigo that left me on the couch for 2 days. After a couple of attacks I went to various ENT’s and have been diagnosed with Meinere’s Disease and Cervical Vertigo. Nothing they gave me helped, so I started looking into it myself. My husband brought home a book called the Body Ecology Diet (BED) and I realized I had Candida. The vertigo, constant “hangover”, horrible allergies, bloating, gas, constipation, UTI’s, massive brain fog, white coating on my tongue, and fatigue were all related. I got my mirena taken out because I read about the birth control link to candida and still hope this will help in the long run. I started the diet (and kept up with it for about 3 months) but saw no difference so I went back to my ways of drinking too much alcohol and eating things that feed the yeast. Of course this just made everything much worse and I had more vertigo attacks and worsening allergies. I felt hung-over everyday day one beer would cause horrible inflammation in my ears and leave me miserable for days. It was weird, because I felt normal when I drank, but horrible for the following 3 days. I guess it was just my body getting the sugar it wanted. I decided to start the diet again, but I knew the BED wasn’t the answer. It has good aspects, and I love the food…but it wasn’t helping fast enough. I found this forum and have been eating veggies only for 4 days. I am waiting to get my moly-b from amazon and then I will start the rest of the detox. So far I have had minimal die off (because I was already eating a very limited diet…just cheating with alcohol and occasional junk food). I think this is going to work! I really feel great and have made more progress in 4 days than months on the BED!! I do like that this diet includes homemade fermented kim chi and sauerkraut because I feel that they really benefit me. Other diets include things like legumes that I could not tolerate at all…so far this diet seems like a good fit for me! I can’t wait to take my life back and have to be strong enough to keep with it! I have been finding substitutes for alcohol like ginger tea and Xylitol…and virgin mojitos. So far so good! It will be nice when I can add a little meat, but so far I am doing surprisingly good without it (I thought I would be STARVING). I feel bad that I started drinking again, but I guess this is a new start. I am ready to rid my life of this and feel like myself again!!  gilly"

1,raster,325,There is no way to know for certain. The only way to know is if you experience “die-off” symptoms after starting the diet and antifungals. Die-off should not be caused by anything else. -raster

3,rale,325,"Hi macdan, I also suffered from IBS and about two years ago I quit all sugar (for reasons totally unrelated to my IBS) and low and behold, the first thing that changed was that my IBS symptoms disappeared. I still eat bread, I’m vegetarian so no meat, only a small amount of cheese sometimes. Then about 6mths ago I started on a green smoothie kick and was adding fruit to the smoothies (bananas, apples, grapes, kiwi etc) and wham my IBS came back with a vengence. So I figured I am either fructose intolerant or the sugar intensified some other imbalance. But all I know is if I stay 99% sugar free (hard to be 100% as they put it in EVERYTHING) I am IBS free. That’s my story anyway, hope it might help in some way. Good luck with your back to health journey. -rale"

5,Able900,325,"Hello, Angor. I don’t know what Thomas is referring to, however, according to a a research study published in the Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology journal, the effects of a low carbohydrate diet on IBS-D symptoms exhibited very positive results. Basically all Candida diets are based on ingesting a minimal amount of carbohydrates and sugar. The patients in the research experiment were allowed only 20 grams of carbohydrates a day and statistics and information were collected during a period of four weeks regarding their IBS symptoms and quality of life. Their symptom improvements were noted in various ways: specifically noted were a decrease of diarrhea, a substantial decrease in pain, and they all reported that the diet had a positive effect on their quality of life. As stated, this was all seen in a relatively short period of just four weeks. With these research findings in mind, a strict Candida diet could be minimally adjusted to suit an IBS-D diet very easily unless a Candida overgrowth is present which would possibly necessitate a closer look at potential changes. The official research report is located on the website below. http://www.cghjournal.org/article/S1542-3565(09)00198-0/abstract Published by the Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology journal, 2009.

6,Javizy,325,"IBS = dysbiosis. Eliminating/reducing pathogens (including candida) and restoring lost beneficial bacteria is almost guaranteed to provide a cure. If it works for much more severe bowel disorders like colitis, why not IBS too? Unfortunately, it’s a delicate, time-consuming process done through natural means, which is why your doctor doesn’t have a clue about it. No effective drug, surgical procedure or radiation therapy = no cure as far as modern medicine is concerned. Candida is still essentially dysbiosis, so, as Able said, the protocol here could be a great place to start. Eliminating starch, sugar and vegetable oils alone can have a profound impact on gut health. I’d try starting the protocol and learning as much as I can about dysbiosis. Researching based on “incurable” labels like IBS will probably waste a lot of your time. This has been my experience with “RSI”. I’ve been reading this blog lately and find the information invaluable: Cooling Inflammation. The most important thing you can do is realise you’re unhealthy for a reason and finding and treating that reason is your path to health."
7,ichigo13,325,The first thing I noticed after following the diet is it cured my IBS. I experienced more energy and regular bowel movement after taking probiotics. Try doing a cleanse first to see if you will experience die-off symptoms. Or maybe do a home-test for Candida?

What is important for a IBS with diarrhoea is LOW Fibre. My suggestion for you is. 1. Get to know if you truly have Candida. If so do the diet and everything you need to get rid of that thing. 2. If you dont have candida but IBS buy the book I told you about. It will help you tons as you will get to know which type of IBS you have. You might even be intolerant to gluten or something.  3. Dont dabble around and do this and that. It will only mess you up. Have a clear plan and follow it for your own best. When I was eating sugar it was for a test only. After I cool all my sympthoms down due to the low fibre diet, I had white bread and sugar etc but got NO reaction. If I would have had Candida I would have had a reaction. But while I was on the high fibre diet here I reacted to everything and never understood which sympthoms belong to what. What is die-off, what is a reaction etc. Now I could do the sugar test because I had peace in my system. you dont need to eat sugar. Only execute a plan of action so you too KNOW what is going on in your system. yours Thomas"
0,KoolKaren,326,"Hello everyone, First of all, I am so happy to have found this website!!! It’s a great feeling to know that there is support out there and others that have had similar symptoms as I. I can’t tell you what a relief this website is. Thank you to those that created this site and also contribute on a regular basis. My story begins when I was a teenager (I’m now 33). I remember having vaginal yeast infections at least once a month sometimes a couple times per month. I’m sure I have had other symptoms that I was not aware of and could be linked to Candida. I also have asthma and I’ve read that it is also related to Candida. I would do the western conventional approach with creams, suppositories and medications. They would take the symptoms away but it would come right back. As I got older I notice certain triggers being alcohol, sex, sugar, carbs, and beer. I have always craved sugar as a kid, adolescent and as an adult. I never thought that it was the Candida that was fueling this craving. When I was in my 20s every time I drank beer it would give me a yeast infection. Socially this was very frustrating. The kicker for me was when I would clear up the infection and have sex I would get another infection. I thought my sex life was over! No matter what I did I would get a vaginal yeast infection after having sex (protected with condoms of course). As I got older I starting living a more holistic healthy lifestyle and discovered natural ways of healing illnesses and ailments. I was determined to heal myself of yeast infections naturally. I began the search of the right foods, supplements and lifestyle. I soon became really down on the fact that my life would not be very exciting at all with limited foods and no alcohol! 🙁 But I went through a period of changing my diet, taking supplements and not drinking alcohol. I was not aware of this site back then. My diet was no where near as detailed as this site has laid out, but it was close. I was able to clear up the yeast infections for a couple of years. I was very happy about this! It was a miracle! I went back to eating what I wanted (healthy of course) and socially drinking alcohol. About a month ago I experienced another yeast infection. I was very sad to see this because it had been a couple of years not having an infection at all. It happened after having lots of sex with a new partner (we had been dating for 2 months and we were both tested for STDs prior to having unprotected sex). I thought it was from having too much sex. But I thought about it more……I actually never got rid of the Candida from my system at all. I just kept it from flaring up from the antifungals I was taking. It was this thought lead me to finding this website. Some other symptoms that I think might be related to Candida are gas and bloating. Are these symptoms related? I get gas all the time and sometimes is very painful. Once in a while I feel bloated. Typically when I have a yeast infection I feel bloated. I have to admit that I am a little frustrated and scared about starting a lifestyle and diet change. I know that I have had Candida in my system for many years and scared that it will take years to get rid of it. Here are my fears/frustrations that I need to get out and maybe some of you can relate and possibly help with suggestions: * Good food – I love food that has lots of flavor and tastes good. I’m fearful that when I go on the diet I won’t get the feeling of satisfaction from the food I will need to eat. Food brings me joy. I love experiencing new and exciting restaurants with friends. I feel sad that those days are completely OVER. If I choose to go I will have a little embarrassment in having to tell the server what I can’t eat and make something special for me. Perhaps lots of fun recipes will help. I did find some on this site that will really help.  * Enough fuel – My other fear is that I won’t get enough to eat. I burn lots of calories naturally and with the lifestyle I currently live. I’m very fit and workout 3-5 times per week and have an active job (massage therapy). Currently I have to eat lots and every couple of hours because I burn so many calories with work and my workouts. Will I get enough food or calories in my body to sustain me throughout the day without feeling really hungry? * Social life – I love to spend time with friends eating, hanging out and sometimes a nice glass of wine. I’m fearful of not being able to ever do that again. But not everything revolves around alcohol, right? I can have a good time with friends without having something in my hand. (I’m not an alcoholic by the way….I enjoy wine once in a while) * Time – I scared to think about how long I will have to be on this diet because I’ve been suffering from Candida for so many years * Travel – How the hell will I follow the diet while traveling? This concerns me. But I have to be diligent about it. * Asthma medication – After years of not wanting to take a steroid for my asthma I started taking one in Jan 2011. I started taking a steroid every day because my asthma symptoms did not improve over time and I was afraid of permanently damaging my lung tissue. I have read that steroids can fuel Candida. Is this true? If so, what the hell am I supposed to do about my asthma? I tried acupuncture for a while before going on the steroids but it didn’t make a big enough change in my asthma. My fear is that I put all this effort into changing my lifestyle and diet and get no where because of the medication I have to be on for asthma. I do have lots of will power and I know I can do this diet. It would just require lots of planning, mindfulness and persistence. Thank you for reading my post and offering your support."
1,raster,326,"I thought I’d try to ease some of your concerns: Food- I have a picky eater problem and it was a hard adjustment to say the least, but my coconut/teff/buckwheat/almond meal bread is pretty tasty, sausage is pretty tasty, and buckwheat tastes pretty good! Eating salads is bomb and I look forward to my meals because they make me feel good! Theres a lot to discover if you like eating veggies; I feel the sky is the limit with the diet. Fuel- Well some of those items I already mentioned give you a lot of energy. Maybe not at first but in the long term you get plenty of energy from the diet if it is well balanced. Chamomile tea is great for giving you energy and is antifungal as well. Social life- Well you might be kinda knocked out for the first month or two but as you get better, you can start to do things like you used to. The trick for going out to eat is to find a place that serves salads and maybe meat/rice. While avoiding alcohol is not fun it certainly is unhealthy and you can have fun without alcohol. Time- Plan on it taking 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth and its trail of destruction. I have been on the diet for about a year and finally feel mostly symptom free. Time is one of the things you need the most, it takes a lot of time to heal the body. Travel- Well if you go off the diet for a week or two (or a modified version of it) it won’t set you back too much, so don’t worry about it! Asthma- Thats a tough one. As you kill candida, the toxins will be detoxed via the skin, via the bowels, and via the lungs. The lungs are the dumping grounds of the body so expect the asthma to get worse. I pretty much became asthmatic initially on the diet (hyperventilating a whole bunch every day) but it became better in time. I expect that your asthma can become signicantly improved or may even go away while on the diet. If you want an alternative to your medication, I recommend trying a naturopathic doctor who will prescribe you natural supplements to address this specifically. Acupuncture can help but isn’t the only thing that you need to address this problem.

0,YeastMan,328,"It has been nearly 6 months since I picked up Candida from someone else. I freaked out/ignored it/tried to figure out what it was for the first month. Here is what I have tried so far. Have tried rotating every 4 days external applications of clotrimazole, miconazole, sulconazole nitrate, while also taking 4 day rotations of grapefruit seed extract and caprylic acid, per the advice of this article. I was also eating <20g of carbs/day at this time. I still am not cured. Currently, I have been eating <20g of carbs/day for two months. Topically I am taking sulconazole nitrate + miconazole powder + talc. Orally I am taking probiotics and grapefruit seed extract, which I rotate with capryllic acid. I take a shower every day, blowdry the area immediately and apply the topical treatment. If I exercise - I do it again. I wear boxer briefs.

2,Able900,328,"External applications of anything will only possibly alleviate a few of the symptoms on a short term basis, and as Chris has stated, the infestation has to be cured from the inside, namely, the intestines and colon.

Anyone who charges this ridiculous price for consultation on the Internet is wasting your time. Their goal is not to cure you, their goal is for you to get your credit out so that they can process a payment. The information which they’re offering ‘free’ such as the info about grapefruit seed extract & C. acid is just the tip of the iceberg and won’t make a dent in the infestation alone. This is because they’re not going to offer any significant information without payment up front. And the bad part is, even if you pay them, you have no idea of whether or not their protocol is any better than a hundred others.

Balancing your gut flora and strengthening the ‘good guys’ will be more important in the long-run than the amount of carbs you eat.

She noticed the white coating on my tongue and from what she observed through my bowels through the colonic. I decided to do some research and found I had a lot of the symptoms of candida and considering that I went to multiple gastroenterologists and they gave me the run around with no clue of what was happening I decided to take matters into my own hands. I am 21 and I curious as to how you guys manage. Im going nuts. My diet consists of eggs(trader joes), apple cider vinegar(braggs), almond butter(traderjoes), brown rice, grass fed organic meats, avocados, flax oil(barleans), olive leaf oil(barleans), EVOO, coconut oil, cinnamon bark oil, oregano oil, mercola probiotics, dgl licorice. I started juicing 2-3 times a day. I ve been doing so for about a week and a half. Green veggies only. I do not eat fruit because of its sugar content. I dont eat veggies that have high sugar. I feel ok when I eat brown rice. I dont notice any major problems. Through out my day even before I even eat a meal I have a juice with kale, lemon, ginger, cucumber, celery, broccoli, asparagus and I still feel gas or have like 2 bowel movements just to start. I dont know what else to do I been eating like this for about a month and I know it takes time so I want to know how you guys maintain a social life. I feel like I have to be locked up in my room. There was a semester where I had to drop out of college because I couldnt leave my house without having horrible gas or a million bowel movements. This has been going on for about a year and a half. Any help please. Im losing hope. I know people have worse symptoms but it sucks to see everyone my age do all of these great activities and I feel caged in on top of the fact that if I talk about health with anyone my age they look at me like im from another planet.

3,Able900,329," I can easily remove the almond butter but should I just eat veggies with no kind of meat? (chicken turkey, beef)The best choice of protein for a Candida treatment is organic eggs. You can eat up to 5 or 6 a day if you have no problem with eggs. Red meat and pork are two things you absolutely don’t need to be eating. When the proteins in meat are broken down, ammonia is released into your body adding to a beneficial environment for Candida to thrive. If you still need more protein, fresh or frozen fish and chicken are preferable, and if you can get organic, all the better.I have seen the most progress when I went on a cooked vegetable diet with chicken for 2 weeks but I always felt light headed, tired and I couldn’t function much at all.That was probably due to the die-off effect, which meant that the Candida were dying and releasing toxins. Before that happens again, you need to purchase a supplement that gets rid of the toxins before they make you sick. Read the link below for more information on this.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm11590_Molybdenum-and-Dieoff-Symptoms.aspx#post11590I also went from 165lbs to 140lbs in just 2 weeks. Isn’t that dangerous in a sense if my weight drops that much?That’s going to happen when you change your diet so drastically, and it happens to everyone. The key to slowing down the weight loss after a few weeks is to add more calories to your diet. As long as you’re obtaining fewer calories that your body needs to sustain its weight in a 24 hour period, you’ll continue to lose weight, so in the end, calories are the answer. How much coconut oil are you taking a day? This is a whole-food antifungal that can also help you gain some weight back. Something called ‘coconut flour bread’ usually helps to slow down the weight loss as well. The recipe is on the forum in the “Recipes” section. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst746_Coconut-Flour-Bread.aspx The probiotic is a fairly good one, but you shouldn’t take any one type throughout the treatment. I would change brands after you’ve used that one. More information on probiotics is in the post below. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1108_Lactobacillus-acidophilus-DDS1.aspxI only had one colonic. I can’t afford to see her often.That’s no problem. Most people who cure their infestation do so without ever having a colonic.

In addition, in order for a person to contract Candida in this manner, all other aspects would have to be present. In other words, the environment would need to be perfect for a yeast overgrowth.please let me know what you think about the juice fast.I mentioned what I think about juicing, and a juice fast is also extremely beneficial; of course that depends on whether or not your body can handle it without causing more harm.

Of course there’s no law that states that you have to take any of the supplements mentioned, the final decision as to whether or not to take them is yours, not ours. To answer your question; yes, I contracted Candida well over a year ago and have been completely cured for around six months.

8,raster,329,"You should look into a vitamin called zypan by standard process. It will help completely eliminate any gas problems that you may have. It has worked really well for me. For weight gain, you should try the teff bread I make under the coconut bread recipe. Another idea is to try coconut milk (if you are not allergic) in the coming weeks/months. I am slightly allergic to it so cannot handle it. In time the weight loss will subside and I have actually managed to gain some weight with the diet. Also chicken, buffalo, or lamb sausage is pretty high in fat and can help with weight gain. If you need any food suggestions, I would be happy to help. I would consider cutting the rice and following the allowed foods list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1136_ALLOWED-FOODS-LIST.aspx I would consider substituting it with buckwheat.

It’s definitely hard being social with this diet but if you bring some snacks with you, you will be more prepared to enjoy social events. I also bring stevia packets and make myself a lemonade coctail with water, lemons and stevia. If you are experiencing a lot of gas still you might want to take a broad spectrum enzyme to help with digestion. Chew your food really well. Try to keep a log of when you get the gas ( i.e. is it with high protein meals or raw cruciferous vegetables). There might be underlying food intolerances as well. two great probiotics are klaires vital 10 and gut pro. You want to slowly increase your probiotic intake….start at one before bedtime….if tolerated add a second in the morning on empty stomach. You want to find your perfect dose for your body weight( refer to gaps diet). Once on max dose for 6 months add in Sach b probiotic which is good for candida. Alternate taking Sach b one day on the other the next day. Good luck!"

For these reasons, Bob’s Organic Coconut Flour is a better choice.If you are experiencing a lot of gas still you might want to take a broad spectrum enzyme to help with digestion.Swedish non-alcohol digestive bitters are a better choice. This is because they stimulate the production of natural enzymes in the body.

In addition, when the bitters are taken just before or immediately after meals they allow the body to produce its own enzymes in the type and amount needed at that time. Able"

14,jo2212,329,"Hi Positivo, I realise this isn’t a current post but I just wanted to say it’s nice to see someone in a similar position as me, I am also 21 and at university, I went on the Candida diet in the second semester of my first year (well over a year ago) because I like you felt sometimes I couldn’t even leave my dorm room, I suffered badly from CFS and IBS. You’re probably doing pretty well (there are set backs and ups and downs all the time) and managing your symptoms but I just wanted to say that there is hope for a social life. I’ve been really lucky and made an absolutely wonderful set of friends who more than accept my odd eating habits. I know that you sound like the crazy person at first when all your friends are eating the same food and you’re having protein and vegetables but I’ve found if you don’t let it bother you it won’t bother others and now when I meet new people they have no trouble accepting the way I eat. I’m known for being the super healthy one of all of us but the others certainly don’t mind, it’s a bit of a running joke and never an issue. In fact one of my friends constantly thanks me for showing her how easy it is to incorporate healthy meals and other people will always congratulate you on your will power and say they wish they could do the same. Most people really want to lead a healthier life style, so be grateful you are. As for going out drinking that’s obviously an issue I’ve struggled with and perhaps a reason I’m not cured (althought there could be many), I rarely drink which is something people do find harder to accept but am always keen to partake in any other activity. You can and should be fun to be around without drinking. Eating out can be stressful but I always approach it with an open mind and find that it is others who become more worried for me (trying to find places for me to eat), most restraunts are more than happy to grilled fish or meat with salad. Remember your on the candida diet to get your life back not to ruin it more so don’t let it dictate or define your life. I know from experience that this is a rollercoaster but as long as you stay positive you know set backs will pass, at the end of the day you are (probably) 100xs healthier than you would have been without this diet so if healthy eating and outlook on food is all you gain from it (unlikely) you are miles ahead of most of the population. :). I would love to here how your doing and any ways you’ve found to cope with socialising, studying etc? Joanna"
0,nikkiserenity,330,"Hi, I have been suffering with all of the candida symptoms at some level or other for the past 15 years. I had previously done candida diets that seemed to work for a while then when I was eating sugar again the symptoms returned. I have seen numerous doctors over the years but no diagnosis, just loads of tests. Then two years ago I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). This was difficult for me to accept as it meant no cure! Last week I read an article that said CFS does not exist and that it is a misdiagnosis for something else. Amoung the list of alternative illnesses was Candida. This screamed out from the page at me because of the severity of most of the symptoms I am experiencing, and knowing I had suffered with candida for many years. So I am back to try this diet, it seems stricter than the one I did before so my fingers are firmly crossed that this time it works and I can get renewed health and vitality."
1,NadjaB,330,"I’m also diagnosed with CFS. But I also think that it is a mix of candida and hypersensitivity. I’ve got the a blend of the symptoms from both diseases, and I think the diet will make my “CFS-symptoms” go away and the hypersensitivity symptoms milder. But I disagree with the article. A know a person who has it bad. She can’t walk and she sleeps uptil 16 hours. Sometimes she sleeps the whole night, eats a bit and is awake in 2-3 hours and then sleeps until the evening, eats a bit and is awake 2-3 hours and then sleeps a whole more night. She is really sick. But I also now another person who is diagnosed CFS that I think is just lazy and a bit mentally ill. I think the diagnose is maybe used a bit too often, instead of really figure out what’s wrong. But not in every case. There is a reason why they study it so intens in Norway, some people are really sick. If you are sure you got candida then go for it! 😀 And be strong, I promise you that this will test your willpower or lack thereof, but I’m sure you can do it when you have found this site. Good luck!"
2,Chris24,330,I also dont believe CFS is really a disease. Rather its a condition that is not clearly laid out yet. Incurable? Nonsense. We are not victims of a disease that falls out of the sky. There is a cause and we can do something about it. Go for it Nikki. And dont hesitate to ask a lot of questions on this forum.
3,nikkiserenity,330,"Nadja, it sounds like your friend has M.E which is definately an illness in it’s own right, as is Fibromyalgia. It is too common nowadays for those to be lumped together with CFS. M.E apparently comes on acutely and people with Fibromyalgia are in a lot of pain, this as far as I can see are the distinct differences from CFS.  Chris I like your optimism that there is a cause and we can do something about it, I certainly intend to.  Thanks both for your support."

5,Chris24,330,"boganmobile wrote:I’m also diagnosed with CFS. But I also think that it is a mix of candida and hypersensitivity. What is hypersensitivity? Is it an illness?  Not an illness, rather a quality. Hypersensitivity refers to high-sensitive persons. It is a relatively new entry in the psychological world. Approximately 1 in 5 or 6 people have what we would call a highly sensitive brain, which means these people have great difficulty filtering information that comes in, which means they get overwhelmed easily. This does not mean they are cry babies or more emotional than others, it means that they notice more and have to process more information than the average person. This chronic overkill of information and stimuli can eventually lead to physical conditions like chronic fatigue, depression and hyperventilation. Especially in this day and age. One highly sensitive person may be more sensitive or less sensitive than the next, making it a rather vague diagnosis, if the word diagnosis is appropriate at all. This can lead to people not understanding it at all, because of the differences between people who call themselves high sensitive. e.g. the extremely sensitive person feels misunderstood because the in his regard less sensitive person (who may call himself high sensitive) claims the same issues as him. But the differences can be too big for the first to accept the latters claim."

0,jules,331,"It’s pretty much a puzzle to me as to how I developed candida overgrowth. All I know is that after 3 months of being pretty prescribed Klonopin all my symptoms appeared and my health problems began. So I was wondering if there was a causal connection? A little bit about myself: I never had many health issues growing up except for insommnia for which I was prescribed Klonopin. Shortly thereafter my debilitating health symptoms began and my world was turned upside down. I suffered from brain fog, lack of physical coordination, fatique, and there was also a weird clicking sound at the upper left neck that started when I took the drug that I still experience to this day. I have taken anti-biotics like Cipro occasionally but that was only after my symptoms started. I went to doctors, chiropractors, accupunturists and got the typical “it’s all in your head” response. So it’s always been a mystery to me as to what this whole thing was that was plaquing me all these years. Only after following protocol on this website have I been feeling like my old self and my symptoms subsided a lot. I just hope that I am no not one those incurable cases and the relief I feel now is not temporary. I really need to get my life back! Enough is enough. Thank you for listening."
1,raster,331,Pharmaceutical drugs can cause all sorts of side effects that can trigger all types of immune responses. It likely damaged or drained one your organs causing your immune system to be suppressed…allowing candida to grow. You also likely had a slight candida overgrowth for awhile beforehand if you took antibiotics in the past. I would more closely look at antibiotics causing your problems because they destroyed both the beneficial and bad bacteria in your gut. Dr. Mcombs feels that even one dose of antibiotics can cause a gut flora imbalance and should be followed up with an extensive use of probiotics. -raster

One of the side effects of Klonopin is liver damage and this is probably what happened. BTW, Klonopin is an anti-seizure medication: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000635/ My doctor prescribed it for my insommnia problem and the root cause was anxiety. I developed my candida overgrowth symptoms after continual use for three months and to my knowledge I never took antibiotics before this so in my case, the candida overgrowth was probably triggered by Klonopin not antibiotic use. I recall telling my doctor that I couldn’t focus as a result of the medication. She responded that the effects of Klonopin would wear off after I discontinued it but I still suffer from the side effects to this day."

6,Able900,331, Klonopan is the trade name for clonazepam. I doubt very seriously that clonazepam has the ability to cause a fungal infection such as Candida since it doesn’t destroy the beneficial bacteria like antibiotics can. Able

All my Candida overgrowth symptoms suddenly appeared after taking Klonopin for three months. Yeah, I had insomnia but in retrospect, the problems are miniscule to the what I am experiencing now. I think klonopin had an indirect affect, maybe damaging my liver and intestinal health, thereby causing an inbalance, which opened the door to candida overgrowth. BTW, I also agree that neck stiffness may be caused by Candida overgrowth, but do you know the logistics behind it?Klonopan is the trade name for clonazepam. I doubt very seriously that clonazepam has the ability to cause a fungal infection such as Candida since it doesn’t destroy the beneficial bacteria like antibiotics can. I don’t think klonopin has a direct effect like antibiotics but it is a drug that is known to damage the liver, so probably has an indirect effect, much like birth control pills.

0,rljrdn,332,"——————————————————————————– To make a long story short – 8 years of chronic inflammation of my back, neck, arm, intestines, other random symptoms with no explanation. Been to 4 chiropractors, 2 md’s, an orthopedic, physical therapy and acupuncture with no help because everyone thought it was a mechanical problem from me being in car accidents. After being in daily pain for so long I decided I wanted to try another route and started investigating anti-inflammatory diets, adrenal stress, etc. I planned to get blood work done for it and started an anti-inflammatory diet but also went to my current chiro who I know does bio-magnetic testing for allergens. He was happy I wanted to try another route and was blown away with how crazy I tested for all kinds of allergens and finally came up with the candida diagnosis. Chronic sinus infections meant antibiotics a few times a year in the past and I’m on birth control and still have metal fillings. He also did some laser acupressure therapy and seemed very positive that we could bring my levels back to normal in a month or so and told me to google candida to learn more. A few hours later my inflammation in my shoulder/arm/back was GONE! I nearly cried. He gave me anti-fungal, anti-histimine, and probiotics to take for two weeks. Said to avoid sugar and the foods I tested positive for but didn’t mention anything about this strict diet I now read about. He also seemed like a few weeks and I’d be all good. BUT…now I’m reading more about this and how hard it is to really permanently get candida in check so that you can go back to a normal life with regular food and no supplements. Is it realistic? Any success stories? After that appointment I stayed on the anti-inflammitory diet and adjusted it for candida after reading online but a lot of the diets online conflict. I’ve been keeping a food journal and I have “cheated” a few times because I didn’t know they were cheats! For example black beans and vinegar in organic homemade salsa. I give myself a treat of organic all natural low sugar frozen yogurt because the ingrediants seem to be fine except the sugar which is lower than some foods that are allowed and non-processed pure cane sugar but I don’t know if this is a cheat or not? Is brown rice allowed on this? What about all natural corn chips/tortillas? I also don’t know anything about doing a cleanse? My inflammation came back in two days and is still here, I experienced die off symptoms for the first week and my stomach is fine now on the diet. I go back to see my chiro on friday and will see what he says now that I’m more informed about this. Should I see another dr. for nutritional and long term advise on this? I don’t mind the sacrifices as long as they are short term (few months, not lifetime) but I’d hate to be sacrificing all this and be doing it wrong. From the foods on here I’ve been probably 95-98% good for level one for the 10 days since going to the chiro. I was “cheating” before that because I was doing anti-inflammatory (gluten-free, no refined sugars, etc) and didn’t know. I took the online questionaire and literally have had dozens of symptoms for years. I’m also terrified to get off birth control and is this all for naught if I stay on it? so many questions…"

Yes, I see your problem, but in all honesty, everyone who has had Candida experienced the same problem when they were trying to start the diet, so you’re certainly not alone. A good rule of thumb is: If a food is listed on even one diet as being a no-no, then don’t eat it. Assume that you should pay attention to the lists with the most foods shown as unfriendly, because the other lists were probably written by someone who didn’t know what they were talking about.  Personally I would leave corn, beets, and peas alone, even in stage two, and corn is something no one needs – ever. Also, you can’t pay attention to a time frame such as, “stay on phase one for three weeks then go to phase two” for blah-blah weeks. In time you’ll learn to ignore any time frame. They’re all inaccurate because every Candida sufferer is different from the last, so nobody knows how long you will need to be in each stage. Does that not make more sense than the same time frame for everyone? This forum is full of posts by people who tried to start adding food just because some set of instructions told them to and ended up starting all over again. You probably tested positive for all types of allergens because weakened adrenals often create allergic reactions to dozens of foods, etc. To explain why some people become allergic to so many different things: During a Candida infestation a person can contract Leaky Gut Syndrome, plus the adrenals can become weakened. When this happens, allergies will often develop. So basically the allergies stem from poorly functioning adrenals. Not everyone with Candida has low adrenals and Leaky Gut, so this is why not everyone with Candida has the same allergies.  Once Candida reaches a fungal form and becomes an infestation it can lead to the Leaky Gut Syndrome. At that point, toxins, yeasts, bacteria, and partially dissolved proteins are allowed to enter the bloodstream via the intestinal walls. Once they’re in the bloodstream they usually trigger allergic reactions. Unfortunately, this can lead to further weakening the adrenals unless treated successfully. Treating weakened adrenals on your own can be tricky, but not impossible, and a doctor can also threat this, but I wouldn’t mention ‘Candida’ to him unless he’s some sort of alternative doctor, because once you do, medical doctors do not take you seriously any longer. Feeling ill, mild headaches, no appetite, bloating and constipation can certainly be symptoms of die-off. There are products which can greatly reduce the symptoms of die-off. Molybdenum and Candidate from Native Remedies are two of the best. As far as the slip-up is concerned, I’d just continue on as you were and not add any new food for the time being. Able"

4,Doggiemama,332,"Wow, in reading all of this..I am a little more confused. This is all new to me so bare with me as I am learning. For two plus yrs, i have been getting dizzy after eating foods..some worse than others. The Drs say..oh its from Meniere’s disease. I dont believe that. Dizzy SPELLS as in the room is spinning..yes that is menieres..but getting dizzy/lightheaded after eating foods isnt. thats my opinion anyway. also i have had food allergy tests done and they all came up negative..but yet when I stayed away from alot of preservatives, it seemed a little better. So for two yrs I have avoided corn products..of all kinds, HFCS as well. Still i have been dizzy and the past 4 months I have really been going down hill. i was eating alot of organic foods as well. BUT i craved sweets like crazy. had to have something chocolatey. i love chocolate but it was an all day thing it seemed. I stumbled across a post accidently in a food allergy forum and someone mentioned candida albicans. i thought what is that..so i googled. and i was amazed of all the symptoms that fit. i have gone to 5 Drs..they cant find anything wrong with me. two i brought CA to them. one said it was rare and he doubted it and the other one told me i needed to see a shrink. LOL well thats when i was done with Drs and decided to take matters into my own hands. which has led me to here. i had already done a cleanse before i ever found this thinking i had some sort of toxins built up in me that eating was aggrevating it. I never lost any weight doing that. it was a slow cleansing. anyway, i have started the stage one diet as of this past Wednesday. and i have got to say, this is one of the hardest things i have ever had to do and ever heard of. i have heard of diets but this one is off the charts. anyway i started my stage one diet and i am 4 days into it and have already dropped 6 lbs. I am very weak although i have been eating..alot of eggs, some chicken and green beans and drinking tons of water. i am taking alot of vitamins and herbs. i have molybdenum, candidate, and almost every herb mentioned on this site. i was preparing for it all. but i am wondering if feeling so weak is normal. I mean..it is hard to walk across the room without being give out and out of breath? otherwise I am not so dizzy..mostly today not as dizzy. and chmicals make me dizzy also..all chemicals. so should/would i have tested positive with food allergies if i have Candida? i am also confused on what i can and cant eat. Can I have Oats? Oat Bran? some sort of Oat Bran oatmeal? can i have xylitol? can i have carob powder or unsweetened chocolate? thinking this i been feeling is part of the die off..I am taking molydbenum, milk thistle, and vit c. it seems in the late evening is when i feel better. not great but good enough to walk across the room without being totally exhausted. I also read no caned goods. i had not ever seen that on any post or diet so that one surprised me. i have been eating canned organics. although i noticed there are 2 grams of sugar in them which i dont think thats much at all.  anyway, just trying to figure this all out but my most concern is my weakness. PS all that so called unsweetened coconut and almond milk is like drinking milk of magnesia. it aint happening.. NASTY!! and i miss my milk."
5,Pattinoo,332,I had extreme weakness as part of die off and it improved after a few weeks but still seems to come and go. Inbox Able for the forum allowable foods list. It’s challenging but continuing to live with Candida is worse and at least with this strict protocol there’s an end in sight….I’d rather have a stricter diet with health sooner than a more lenient diet where it would be even tougher to figure out which foods are causing what…
6,Doggiemama,332,Thanks Pattinoo. Well Orka has said they had experienced it also. the last tow days have gotten a little better. I think it was going from one diet to a strict diet. My body was shocked. My body was use to feeding off of lots of sugar..now it has none. But now I am reading other posts of this..so I am assuming it is normal..but man its tough and scary…
0,Verxea,333,"I love food. This is one of the reasons I am here in the first place. I’m a foodie, and I like to try everything. I love to cook (and do it professionally). I have a great time experimenting with food and I love to be creative with my ingredients. So I’m taking this diet on as a challenge, I’m going to try and make filling, delicious and creative food out of the limited ingredients that the diet allows. I just started my cleanse yesterday, but I’m going to try and post my experiences and progress as often as possible, but I’ll especially be posting my meals and/or recipes. I know making my food exciting for me will definitely help me stick with the diet, maybe my recipes can help other people stay interested in their food too. I’ll try and make time in my busy schedule to post as frequently as I can. Yesterday I wasn’t feeling particularly hungry, which I guess was very convenient. For breakfast I had an avocado with a little sea salt and pepper sprinkled on top.  For lunch I made some guacamole and dipped sliced cucumber into it (an excellent chip/cracker substitute). For dinner I sliced up and marinated some eggplant, zucchini and asparagus and then grilled them on the barbecue. Marinade: -olive oil (extra virgin and cold pressed) -fresh rosemary -fresh thyme -dried oregano (couldn’t find any fresh) -garlic -shallots  -sea salt -fresh ground pepper -a little bit of turmeric It was incredibly delicious. Be careful not to over oil the eggplant, because it will just sop up the oil and taste oily. You can use all dried ingredients if you want as well. Yesterday I felt a migraine coming on all day, which developed into a really bad one at night. I woke up with the migraine this morning, and it felt worse. Could this be the die-off? It seems a little premature so early into the cleanse, but I don’t know. This morning I wasn’t hungry because of the migraine, so I did not eat breakfast (just lemon, mint and hot water- I think the mint helps cut the tartness of the lemon). I had to get to work so I took some Motrin and had a bath and that seemed to help. To make up for missing breakfast I made a huge fajita salad for lunch. Wow was it good. And filling too. First I sautéed some green pepper, onions and garlic in some organic extra virgin coconut oil (add the garlic in way after the peppers and onion, so it doesn’t burn) on medium-low heat. Then I added some cumin, a little bit of chilli powder (just for taste), a bit of cinnamon, a bit of turmeric and sea salt and ground pepper. I added a bit of water and lime juice to mix the dry ingredients around. At the end after the heat was turned off I mixed in some fresh cilantro.  Then I tossed it on a bed of mixed greens and topped it with some big scoops of guacamole, squeezed some lime on it and tossed in some fresh cilantro. You can sprinkle some sea salt on top to add flavour. I find this salad doesn’t need dressing (the guacamole and lime juice acts as a dressing). Guacamole: -avocado -garlic (minced) -shallots (diced)- I like to use shallots in place of Spanish onions, because their taste is more mild -cucumber (diced)-I added this to replace tomatoes and to add a little texture -lime (or lemon) juice- a lot of lime juice is the key to a good guacamole IMHO -fresh cilantro -salt and pepper (to taste) -optional: jalepeño (diced) I like my guacamole to have a lot of texture so I don’t cut the avocado after it’s been scooped out. Instead I mash it up while I mixing in all the ingredients at once. I sort of make my meals up as I go, and season to taste, so sorry for not providing measurements. If any of you would like to recreate any of these meals, then let me know and I’ll pay attention to the measurements next time I make it. Looking forward to the challenge and becoming healthy… Verxea P.S. if anyone is having difficulty with the taste of the detox drinks, etc. I found that chewing a couple of mint leaves helps to get the bad taste out of your mouth."
0,carriel,334,"Let me premise this by saying that I will surely come off as completely nuts for saying this but- I’ve been looking at electron microscope images of Candida Albicans online for possible use in an art project (I’m a filmmaker) and I’m struck by how interesting many of the images are! How can something so detrimental be so beautiful up close?! (well, maybe beautiful isn’t the right word…?!) This damned yeast has been consuming my every thought ever since I pinpointed it as the cause of so many years of misery! I was diagnosed a little over a month ago so this is all pretty new to me! REALLY wish I had had more information years ago as it would have saved many trips to many doctors!! I am grateful to FINALLY know what this is that has been wreaking havoc inside me as now I can work towards getting better! I’ve suffered since late childhood from RIDICULOUS allergies-super reactive skin issues (rashes, eczema, itchy/dry, hives…and on the list goes!) and then in my teens started the extreme hay fever/cold-flu type symptoms (headaches, sinus inflammation, constant post nasal drip, sinus infections, sore throats…) I grew up in the damp of Northern California and there was always mold somewhere in the house so I’m pretty sure that my issues go WAY back! I was also raised on a very ‘processed foods diet’ so I can see now, how so many factors came together to form the perfect breeding ground! What tipped me over the final edge was a major spine surgery (fractured vertebra) 3 years ago. I was pumped full of meds including a HARDCORE course of antibiotics. My spine healed beautifully but the rest of me has felt sick ever since! Feels as though I’ve had the flu for the past 3 years! Following the surgery my weight shot up and so did my blood sugar levels/was diagnosed with prediabetes. (the yeast LOVED that!) Started eating Low Glycemic but was still eating all of the wrong things (whole wheat,soy, fruit…lots of honey & agave!) My skin has completely turned on me and out of the blue started to burn/rash with use of my normal regimen of (all natural!) products. (not quite as bad now!) My entire body went haywire! Depression, fatigue, aches & pains, cramping in my abdomen, nausea, heartburn, bloating, gum problems, (too many mystery symptoms to name!) No specific major food allergies but its felt like my body has constantly been in a state of super histamine reaction! Prior to finding out about candida & changing my diet I was waking up very early in the am with these MADDENING cravings for sugar! We’ve all heard/experienced it here though haven’t we? (realized that I’m venting!!) Just so grateful to find such good advice here in a sea of differing opinions on treatment. (Good, Sound, Common Sense, Tried & True advice!) Have stumbled a bit through the 1st 5/6 weeks but have learned SO much from reading the posts here! Stay strong everyone! Looking forward to getting to know some of the others on the forum. Thanks for indulging my rant! Carrie"
0,zed,335,"Hi guys, found this forum a couple weeks back. I’ve probably had candida for a long time… maybe since my teens. I am 29 now and I am realizing how much it has effected me. My symptoms: Anxiety, Depression, Involuntary movements of the body (dystonia/myoclonus), involuntary facial twitches, social anxiety, Obsessive thoughts, intrusive thoughts, Adrenal Fatigue/CFS, Sebhorreic dermatitis on scalp, Hair loss, Parasites. Needless to say its been devastating to my life. Initially I thought I had a movement disorder but when I did a colon cleanse with psyllium and bentonite like the cleanse on this website, my symptoms cleared up 75%. However they all came back as I ate regular food again. I didn’t suspect a candida connection then but I knew it had to do with the gut. If I am to guess, I think at least some percentage of movement disorders are caused by candida and leaky gut when the body starts to attack its own nerve structures. I feel that there is also a spiritual aspect to this illness. I have felt like an out of control victim of circumstances for my whole life and that I feel has shown up as candida in my body literally robbing me of control of my own muscles and body. This feeling is probably due to some unresolved issues/limiting beliefs that I have. I’ve worked on that some, and now its time to work on the physical. Although in the past I’ve tried diets… I haven’t succeeded because I had some negative mindset like an all or nothing attitude so if I cheated, then I just completely binged and gave up. That was not healthy. The other thing is that, this time the stakes are higher in my life to get this in control. So its up to me to roll up my sleeves and make this work. My current plan is to follow this diet for some time and then switch to the GAPS diet that focuses on healing the intestinal lining. I start tomorrow with 3 days of veggies only and then switch to the full diet gradually. Wish me luck!"

0,wenkins,336,"Prior to joining the health shop (working here now for 2 1/2 yrs) I’d never heard of candida.  I then suspected I had it (reading etc.), and our Nutritionist claims he told me I had it when I mentioned my chronic constipation (for at least 15 years I’ve only gone to the loo every 3 or 4 days). Oh, and prior to this I did not consider this constipation – I thought I was lucky (I have an extremely fast metabolism so thought my system was hanging onto the food to get everything out of it) – I went to the loo when the calling came (no sitting and squeezing). It was a blessing when camping/backpacking 🙂 AND! I lived on junk food (sweets, crisps, cooldrink) on the run, and no supplements. Then about 3 months back I was asking a customer if she suffered from thrush and she mentioned she could place her worn underwear back in her draw as she has no discharge and thus no candida (in her mind). WELL! that’s when I realised how long I’ve had it … and how bad I have it. My symptoms are (going to get rather personal here): Hectic discharge (white/yellow, very liquidy, not smelly) Chronic constipation (3 to 4 days between movements – I’m down to 2 days av.) Always burbing (I could win compo’s) Very dry skin (and I live in a rather humid climate) Skin on arms and legs lack elasticity (I’m asuming this has something to do with candida due to toxins) Itchy skin – always have quick itches around the body (no rash) Like I said – they never really bothered me, but I’ve realised that being full of toxins aint good, and I’d actually like to go to the loo more often and have softer skin. I however have always been (and still am) energetic, chirpy, quick healing, and not ever suffered depression or fatigue and the other symptoms some of you go through."
0,ippikin,337,"Hello all, I’ve experienced ‘Brain Fog’ for around 2 weeks now. I’ve come to the conclusion that I have candida overgrowth in my gut. This is because I took two courses of antibiotics a month ago, which caused constipation, followed by a week with a lot of fast food and alcohol. The only symptoms I am experiencing are brain fog, slight head ache, slight constipation, general malaise. I’ve been on the diet for two days now and my Molybdenum is in the post. I’m also an sprint athlete and studying for a masters degree. I have my University championships in the Olympic stadium in 10 days, and I feel it’ll be impossible to stict strictly to the diet while I’m there. I’m going to try and log my journey to get rid of this and would much appreciate your support and advice. I’ve been healthy all my life, and this has come at a really bad time. Ippikin."
1,ippikin,337,"So after reading some more posts I think I need some advice on how drastically to do this. As I have to train and compete in track, and work on my masters dissertation, which will be difficult while feeling severe ‘die-off’. Can anyone comment on how severe it sounds like my overgrowth is? As my symptoms haven’t been very severe. Today is my second day on the wagon, and I do feel a little worse, but essentially I can function, and train at a high intensity. But feeling spaced-out. Edit = Just ate some Quinoa, with whey protein and stevia… feel a whole lot better. Maybe some of my symptoms are just a lack of carbs? Only had veg and fish all day."
2,Chris24,337,"ippikin, I would advice to postpone any diet or treatment until after your championship thing. To answer your question: The whey protein is lactose and feeds your candida. This gives an energy boost. Anything that feeds candida in the very early stage will give you an energy boost. Switching to too strict a diet will mess you up I fear. Candida comes from internal weakness, in your case, it seems, the antibiotics. Your condition presumably being not so bad, I would advice to keep busy with being an athlete, while concentrating on that internal weakness. You need to focus on rebuilding your gut flora and with that inner strenght. So instead of starving yourself and nuking your body with antifungals, concentrate on the cause and work towards health with probiotics, exercise, and good food. Also, I have to ask: do you suffer from stress or anxiety of any kind?"
0,misscandida,338,"Hi all, I am a 28 year-old girl and I’ve been fighting with candida my whole life. I have probably been diagnosed for the first time 10 years ago, and went on my first “detox” diet. Felt better for a while, so went straight back to my eating habits. This has happened at least 5 times, with 5 different specialists and waste of loads of money. I hate this thing, I really do. My biggest problem, the worst of the symptoms, and the hardest to cope with, is the bloating. I believe, and all the doctors I’ve seen have confirmed it, that it is caused by candida. Very few days go by without this really affecting my life. I work in an office 9-5 and have a very full social life, that is being compromised by my problem. I usually start bloating right after lunch (whatever I eat it, makes no difference, even when I don’t eat at all – tried that as well). In the middle of the afternoon the cramps start coming, and I start going to the loo to try and feel better, but it usually doesn’t work… I do realize it’s because my bowel movements are not regular enough, and stuff gets stuck in my gut and start fermenting, but I never really managed to find a way to solve the problem once and for all. Is there anyone who has the same problem to this extent? How do you deal with it? I am starting to get anxious and to plan my life around it 🙁 Anyway, I decided to start the diet once again, and I have to say that reading all the posts from you guys made me feel much better. Cause believe me I don’t know any of my friends with my same issues and whenever I’m on the diet and we go out for dinner I die, looking at what they eat (useless to say I LOVE food, specially dairy, sweets, cakes and whatever feeds the candida!!!) So from Sunday (I am not trying to delay this, just waiting for my supplements to arrive ;)) whenever I am put in front of a cake, or a piece of cheese, or something delicious I can’t have, I am going to think about all my fellow sufferers, and hopefully it will help keep me motivated! 🙂 Thank you again, and may the force be with me and us all 🙂 M."
1,sammcl,338,"Hi M, welcome. Sorry to hear you’ve been suffering for so long. I’ve personally suffered from Candida for over three years, but I only found out in late Feb what was wrong with me after a series of tests recommended by a nutritionist. The diet plan she put me on was so wrong, so many sugars all over the place. I found this forum and found the strict diet that this forum promotes. Now, before I go any further, my candida got so bad that I woke up every morning so bloated, it was awful. I pushed myself every morning to run 30 minutes and have a 15 minute sauna session just to feel slightly better. By the end of January I had had enough and decided to see a nutritionist. I had been to about 8 doctors over those three years and had just about every medical test done on my insides and they found nothing wrong, that’s when I decided it must be the food I was putting in that is the cause. So here I am following “the protocol” that was written by Able and Raster. Even after a short space of time, I already don’t wake up in the morning bloated and I actually get a good nights sleep now. I am still going to be following this diet for a very long time, but I’ve seen an improvement already. Nothing but love."
0,CandidaGirl,339,"Hi. I’m in my mid-twenties, and I’ve been battling chronic vaginal yeast infections for the past four years at least. CHRONIC. As in, four times a month. Once I heal one, I get it again. I have built up a tolerance to Diflucan and now need about three pills to cure an infection. I moved to a new state, and I’m currently going to Planned Parenthood, but they will only give me one pill at a time and it does nothing. I can’t go on like this. I first started researching the Candida Diet last year, but now I am fully ready to take this on. I quit drinking, I quit smoking, and made a grocery list to start the cleanse/detox… I’m eating lots of avocados, garlic, coconut oil, raw sauerkraut, kim chi, steamed green veggies, raw green veggies, and I bought a juicer so I’m juicing tons of raw green veggies. I am following the allowed foods list to a T. I am also drinking the detox drinks and liver cleanse daily, and drinking sooo much water. Day 1-3 were fine and I felt the same, but I never had a bowel movement. I was feeling really blocked up, so I took a gentle laxative on the night of day 3. I woke up, Day 4, and had a BM. I then drank my detox drink, and an hour later I ate some Kim Chi and a tablespoon of coconut oil. I started getting the sweats and felt extremely nauseous. I eventually threw up. Ugh. A friend of mine did the detox once, and she told me she felt like CRAP by day 3 or 4 for only a couple days, then by the end of the cleanse, she felt great. I know it’s different for everybody, and in my research around the forums and website, it seems as if people don’t experience the die-off symptoms until Stage 2, the diet, when probiotics and anti-fungals are introduced. I haven’t felt ANY die-off symptoms yet, so I don’t know if that’s normal or not? The only thing I’ve noticed is I’m pretty sure my yeast infection has gotten a bit worse. I’m assuming throwing up has to do with the laxative rather than a die-off symptom. Today, I’ve had one detox drink so far, and two avocados sliced up with garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper. Also one tablespoon of coconut oil. I don’t feel nauseous at all, but my stomach burns. It could be the garlic. Also, no BM. I read on here that a lot of you skip the detox. I decided not to because I feel like my body could use one anyway. The website says to do it 1-2 weeks before starting the diet, but I guess I’m just going to see how I feel after a week or so. If I continue to feel the same as before, I guess I’ll go another week… So I guess, what exactly is the point of the cleanse? Isn’t it supposed to help prepare my body to clean out? I honestly feel no changes and I’m not having BMs. I’m just confused because I want to feel like it’s doing something before I move on to Stage 2. I was kind of expecting to feel a tiny boost of energy or something from all the live enzymes I’ve been eating but nope… __ I will continue to let you guys know how my journey is going as well as ask any questions. SO much helpful information and I’m very thankful for this website, and WOW I hope this helps my chronic/constant yeast infections. ;("

0,rose8marie,340,"Hello all! Not sure when my last post was, but I’m pretty sure it was sometime in November. Last time I was on here I had just started the Candida diet and was finding it hard to stay on it with all the food that my family cooks. I felt isolated and almost as if I was being snooty not eating what everyone else was eating. So needless to say, I stopped the diet and failed miserably. For a while I was fine, I tried limiting yeast and sugar as much as I could, but my sweet tooth (or the Candida’s sweet tooth) got the better of me. I have had recurring vaginal yeast infections in the past and after Easter’s candy, cake, and plenty of sweetened drinks, the yeast came back. I am so sick of having to deal with this that I am truly going to try and stick to the diet. I figure I’ll just focus on the meat (which I do love a good filet) and vegetables that are low in carbs. I can deal with cutting out most carbohydrates, but potatoes are still going to have to be there (I love potatoes!) I hope that this works out and I’ll keep an update coming.

0,NadjaB,341,"So.. I cheated once(a BIG one) and may have eaten a little too much brown rice, eaten green apples too early, etc. So now I’m starting over! And I’m gonna use my savings account. To be on a vacation feeling crappy isn’t that great so I choose to stay home and making my self feel awesome! I’ll follow the strict diet Able and Raster have made and gonna buy this: Vitamin C (bladder infection) Ordinary vitamin pill Molybdenum ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/Molybdenum-100-x-250mcg-Tablets/dp/B004UMQ2Q0/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC?ie=UTF8&coliid=IFPCMN10PFTQX&colid=2VPO6PHTMSZWG – is this the “real” thing?) Stevia (to use 2 weeks in) 12,5 kg of organic oatbran (to use 2 weeks in) Then I wont have to buy it for a year or more 😛 4 kg of organic buckwheat Nettle leaf capsules (bladder infection) Garlic capsules Coconut oil 1 kg of organic coconut flour 1 kg of organic buckwheat flour 2×180 capsules of symbioflor (good probiotic) Grapeseed Extract. Is this the thing? : http://www.amazon.co.uk/HealthAid-Grapeseed-Extract-5000mg-Tablets/dp/B002QWH0YO/ref=sr_1_1?s=drugstore&ie=UTF8&qid=1333885360&sr=1-1 And maybe SF722 ( http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thorne-Research-Formula-Gelatin-Gelcaps/dp/B0055OTUFM/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC?ie=UTF8&coliid=I1IYQ6IT68VYL4&colid=2VPO6PHTMSZWG ) But what is this good for? I got a lot of anti fungals already so maybe I don’t need this? (It’s also very expensive..) Do I miss anything?? How often should I take Molybdenum? How much coconut oil a day? How many probiotics? 3,75, 7,5, 11,25 or 15 biollions. a day? How much grapeseed extract a day? A lot of questions -hoping for some good advice. – Thank you. Nadja"
1,Positivo,341,"I take molybdenum everyday, 3 tablets that’s the most ive seen anyone recommend. Coconut oil start at 3 tablespoons then after 3 days add one tablespoon each day too you reach 16. I believe that’s wat ur supposed to do. I’m only around 9-10 day. I start to feel really nauseous. I’m getting 200 billion cultures and 10 strains of probiotics. Grape seed extract I’m taking 30 drops a day when I’m not on oregano oil. Eat raw garlic as well. Braggs apple cider vinegar is great too. Good luck and stay strong and positive."
2,raster,341,"I don’t think those are majorly bad cheat items and you don’t have to start over…if all you get is a reaction and maybe a loose bowel, that is not the end of the world and you can get over it with a few days (or hours). Dont feel like it made the candida “bloom” like it went for 50% to a 100% in one feeding! Its not like you drank alcohol or anything… If you are taking other antifungals you don’t need to take SF722. However, after you use those antifungals for 6-8 weeks, I would then rotate on to either another antifungal or to SF722. Candida cannot adapt to SF722 very well, so its a very effective long term antifungal you can use (by itself) when you are ready to have just one antifungal. It prevents candida from (re)attaching to your mucousal membranes which is the only antifungal I know that does this. Its a great one for later in your treatment. It is expensive but if you buy online, it’ll save you some dough. Here’s the vitamins post: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1173_Vitamins-Minerals-Herbs.aspx and here is the antifungal post: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm12975_ANTIFUNGALS-Correct-Doses.aspx#post12975 For probiotics; ideally you’d want to start out at 20-50 billion a day or so (if you get a high count one). Eventually you should increase to 3 capsules per day of whatever strength you are taking (for financial reasons, the more you use the more it’ll dissappear). I personally have only been taking 37 billion per day for the majority of my treatment (its a high quality one that I’ve been recommending over and over). When I take megaflora, I take 60 billion per day. I don’t know if I’d take symbioflor; i’d consult able about this one. It has glucose as an ingredient…it’ll help your bowel movements because it contains magnesium chloride. -raster"
3,NadjaB,341,Thank you for your answers! 🙂 I’ll try to find a stronger probiotic.
4,raster,341,"Also instead of the “ordinary vitamin pill” I would look at getting some kind of trace mineral vitamin instead. For instance get a zinc/magnesium/calcium vitamin; candida will eat up the trace minerals within your body so its very important to mineralize. There are more of course such a iodine, potassium, etc…but calcium/magnesium/zinc is a major one. I’d also consider cod liver (or fermented cod liver oil if you want a super high end one). Cod liver is anti-inflammatory and has a variety of benefits. You need to lower the inflammation of gut in order to get better (the diet does this also). -raster"
5,kitty,341,"NadjaB Those really don’t seem like bad cheats and they are all healthy foods. Try not to feel bad about them. 12,5 kg of organic oatbran seems like a lot. I personally wouldn’t buy that much because it may have increased chances of growing mold once opened and stored for a long time. Also, it’s possible that some of the grains we buy come with some mold from the way they’re processed or stored so if you are buying one bag at a time then you have more variety. Some with and some wihtout, but if you buy a big 12,5 kg bag, it might be an unlucky one or it might not. I think you’re missing swedish bitters and I don’t see grapeseed extract. Maybe it’s grapefruit seed extract? Good luck to us!"

0,mishimasan,342,"OK, I’m back with my results so far after the 7-day cleanse. It’s good, and not so good. I did enemas for the first few days then swiftly upped the ante and attended colonics every two days for three sessions. It got a LOT of matter out of me—the most noticeable amount being the last session which was just a few days ago, after 5 days of water fasting. I went from around 74kg to 61kg in the space of just a week and at the end of it, the external symptoms were incredibly subdued and had regressed a lot… but had not disappeared as I’d hoped. I have been using chlorophyl twice a day, oil of oregano caps (internal and external—I simply slashed the cap and rubbed the oil on the area), black walnut tincture, milk thistle and pau d’arco, raw garlic and coconut oil (internal and external) to try to destroy the candida (one to two tablespoons a day). I’ve gotten my hands on Bragg’s apple cider vinegar and been taking that internally and externally with mixed results (one time my candida exploded, others it’s just burned like crazy). I’ve experienced some big die-off effects from all of this, and some smaller ones. I’ve been taking pantothenic acid, high-strength acid-free vit c caps, and acidophilus & bifidus caps to try to balance my body. Not sure how effective this has been. I’ve also been taking bentonite clay and psyllium husk drinks to detox the gut in-between hydrotherapy sessions which seemed to work a real treat. My elbows have gotten a lot worse (they started off almost unnoticeable but now they’re larger and itchier spots) but under my arm has gotten much better (started off huge, bleeding and leaking plasma but is now smaller, less itchy and smoother and does not bleed or leak plasma anymore… see the image below for a before image). I have tiny single red spots that are itchy that have popped up around my body. No doubt these are from the candida die-off and are completely natural during a cleanse. My under-arm rash (before): https://skitch.com/clementyeung/8u1ip/candida-under-arm My elbow rashes (now): https://skitch.com/clementyeung/8u1iq/candida-elbow Chest spots (now): https://skitch.com/clementyeung/8u1iq/candida-elbow I went on to the second phase of the diet which was to reintroduce foods and go on a strict protocol. However, the symptoms weren’t yet gone—I was simply following the diet guidelines telling myself it would be OK (when I kinda knew it wouldn’t) and the first day I overdid it by eating too much. I got short-sighted and anxious to eat again. The symptoms have worsened and now I’m getting back to the same position from which I started. It seems like such a drag to go back on to a water fast, so I’m asking what you would do in this situation. I plan on seeing a naturopath in the next few days to find out what they think I can do. Hopefully I don’t get a cowboy/girl. In the meantime, I’m going to go back on the fast and apply the treatments even more to try to rebalance my body. I also bought a kefir starter kit and some milk. Do you think I should start making my own kefir now? I heard that it’s incredible for balancing the gut flora so that the candida cannot proliferate. The acidophilus & bifidus caps are expensive… I appreciate your feedback. Cheers!"
1,Positivo,342,Welcome  I have to say I don’t know much about your symptoms I would wait til able or raster reply to this as they seem to have the most knowledge and experience here. All I can say is keep trying and be positive. Keeping taking steps forward. Don’t blame yourself too much about over eating. I just did it today and I’m gassy as hell as we speak. It’s a part of the process. Make mistakes and learn quickly. I don’t think it’s that great of a set back. This is probably an up and down experienc for us all. Some days are great and others are terrible. Stick with it and know that the bad days will pass. Good luck and I hope someone on this forum can give you the information you need to reach your goals. Stay positive

0,fscott,343,"I don’t know that this post will be particularly useful for anyone and I don’t have any questions but I think it’s important that I write my story down. I’ve cut myself off from everyone and so it’s probably best that I put myself out there somehow, even if it’s just on the internet. I’m afraid that I’ll get so isolated for so long that after a certain period I won’t be able to connect with anyone. I had intestinal parasites for about a year and a half. I was embarrassed about it and I didn’t have health insurance so instead of going to a doctor I ordered antibiotics online. Stupid. Did a couple rounds. Didn’t cure me. After about 8 months I got a real diagnosis from a doctor and he prescribed me a round of antibiotics. I noticed when I read about the parasite online that it kept mentioning how I needed to follow the antibiotic I was prescribed with another antibiotic to truly eradicate the thing. Didn’t say anything to my doctor about it because I assumed he knew what he was talking about. Again, stupid. After the infection didn’t clear he put me on another round of the same antibiotics. Didn’t work. Several months later I went to another doctor and insisted to him that I get both types of antibiotics. It worked and within a few weeks I was feeling great. I had forgotten how it felt to have a working body. My brain was finally working again and I was able to appreciate things in a new way. I fell in love with someone. For the first time. It was great. Then he broke up with me (over a text message) and I stopped taking probiotics and I stressed and I drank a bunch of alcohol and I didn’t sleep very much. And that’s how I got Candida. My digestive system started to go downhill. I started getting yeast infections on my penis. I couldn’t think clearly. I was easily irritated and I was becoming a real asshole. Even when I wouldn’t act like an asshole, I would still think like one. All my life people had joked about how overly nice I was and suddenly I was the biggest prick I knew. I started following a kind of anti-candida protocol about 5 months ago. But I’ve made a number of mistakes that have hindered my progress. Followed the wrong advice. Took several products which I now think were probably useless and maybe even detrimental. Still, I feel significantly better now. I’m glad that things are moving in the right direction. I’ve recently started a much more strict protocol. The thing I would most like to resolve is my mental clarity. I know that I’m not as sharp as I used to be and it drives me crazy. I don’t really enjoy interacting with people because I know I’m not as clever as I could be and so I just get embarrassed. Also, I hate the idea of candida creeping up into a conversation because it makes very me uncomfortable to talk about. I don’t wan’t to explain why I’m not drinking and why I eat rutabaga. I assume people will think I’m a nut because doctors don’t recognize this condition and because I’m getting my medical advice online. I’m hopeful that I can cure this thing. The diet is not that hard anymore and I actually enjoy the discipline the treatment requires. I know I need to start adopting a more positive attitude and this website has helped me to move in that direction. I’m grateful for that."

It can be uneasy at first at a young age but at least you figured it out before too much time passed. Something I should say is that most medical doctors do not believe in candida aside from thrush or vaginitis, so you may need to look around. I am fortunate enough that my GP does and I never had to find a different doctor."

However, be prepared that this could last from 6-18 months depending how severe it is. Considering how young you are I doubt that it is really severe. You know when the diet is working when you start to feel better and there is more good day then bad. Are you cleansing? “i’m eating all green vegetables at home” If not you need to add in some fat and protein. Such as free range/organic eggs, chicken, turkey, Virgin Coconut Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil."

You should try to find “organic virgin coconut oil.” There isn’t always a huge difference between something that’s called “virgin” and the regular, but in the case of coconut oil and the treatment for a Candida overgrowth, this does make a big difference. “Virgin” oil is going to be a bit more expensive, so again, use this providing you can afford it.2.

12,Able900,344,"JaneneBean wrote: What if you can’t do the coconut oil or vinegar? I throw up trying to swallow that. They both make me gag. You can cure the infestation without the vinegar, Janene, and probably without the coconut oil although with a lesser chance, and if you can find a way to incorporate it into you regimen, it would make the treatment work easier and quicker providing you didn’t do a lot of cheating on the diet. But, and folks, I know I keep repeating this, however, if you feed the Candida and then kill it only to feed it again, you’re climbing on a never-ending wheel of killing and replenishing the Candida population. If you find that you can’t tolerate the coconut oil at all, I would definitely try to obtain Undecylenic Acid-SF722: Start with one pill a day and work up to six a day. Remain at this amount unless you have a naturopath who recommends otherwise. You don’t need to alternate this with any other antifungal. This is all on the “Antifungal” post. Able"
0,JaneneBean,345,"Hello everyone, My name is Janene and I have been suffering from Candida symptoms for probably around 5 or more years. I originally thought I had Irritable bowel syndrome, what with all the bathroom issues I had. I’ve never been constipated much, but I would have random bouts of diarrhea accompanied by severe stomach cramps. I suffered from mild depression, lethargy, body aches, skin conditions, dry eyes, brain fog…etc. Then last April all heck broke loose and I got this massive yeast infection. I figured it was due to stress as I was going through a divorce. No matter what I tried, I couldn’t get rid of it; and to my horror and dismay, it turned into a rectal yeast infection which made matters worse. Then the awful rectal itch began tormenting my days and nights. Meanwhile, I decided to try several ideas I had read about online. Capprylic acid, coconut oil, garlic, tea tree oil, herbs, supplements, probiotics I found at health food stores. Nothing worked. Finally I went to the Doctor and he prescribed Diflucan and gave me an extra pill in case the first one didn’t work well enough. I took one, then about 10 days later, took the other. That didn’t work. Next I got a prescription for Nystatin. Guess what? It didn’t work either. I was so disappointed as I was assured that one of those prescriptions would finally take this awful rectal itch away. Meanwhile, I was getting used to a life with horrible itching, tingling, raw patches and a permanent rash on my butt. It would crack and peel, bleed sometimes, and ooze a bit. This is not something I’m prepared to live with for the rest of my life. There HAS to be an answer. Now, I’m not sure if I can say this here because of rules and all, but I broke down and ordered some Threelac. It had such good reviews and after researching the information about the bad probiotic in it, something having to do with a dangerous ingredient, I came to the conclusion that it was as safe as anything else I had tried that had failed. It can’t be that healthy to scratch so much and have a raw tush. I needed a solution. It had been 10 months since I got this horrible condition and I’m about as patient to find the answer as a toddler at Christmas. I put myself on the Candida diet and have pretty much adhered to it for the most part. I stopped eating gluten all together which has helped me in other areas and only a bit with the Candida. I’m sure in the long run, the gluten free diet will make a big difference. I don’t eat sugar or any processed foods. I use Stevia and drink Teeccino. (chicory coffee) I started taking it on Feb. 27, so it’s been almost a month. I noticed within just a few days that my symptoms were improving. But I didn’t get excited because other things had the same results initially. I had some die off which was bearable with Benedryl. Within the first week, I could take a shower without nasty pain from rawness. Within 2 weeks, I could go most of the day without itching. Now I’m continuing to improve, although still itching, not nearly as bad. I’ve noticed other benefits from the Threelac too, like improved brain fog symptoms, less depression, more energy, normal bowel function, and a few others I can’t really recall right now.  I went ahead and ordered a second box which I just started on. It’s the only thing that has consistently worked at all. The drawbacks of taking it is that you DO have die off and when those toxins are released, in my case…they go to the skin. I have itchy bumps in various areas that act like a form of hives or bug bites. I decided to take Milk Thistle to help with that and plenty of vitamin C. I’m getting improvement with the itchy bumps now though and will probably not be dealing with them in another month.  The main thing is, all of my symptoms are bearable now and getting better finally. I will try and ween myself off Threelac and onto a regular probiotic later, but for now, I need something stronger. I take three of them a day which seems to be just right.  Hopefully my story will help someone, maybe give you some ideas on what you can try. I’m not pushing the Threelac, I know it’s not for everyone and there are always risks. But with my horrible symptoms, and a job where I cashier at our local grocery store, on my feet all day, I HAD to get better. Itching rectally isn’t cool at work. It’s horrendous!  I’m not suffering with vaginal yeast symptoms now either which is wonderful. I did have it in both places for months and that was a nightmare!  If anyone has questions regarding my Candida journey, feel free to ask. I’m an open book and just want to help others get through it. I will post my progress as I go so we can all benefit from my experiences. The good news is I lost about 60 lbs. on the Candida diet and gluten free diet. I went from a size 16 to a size 7. Now I just want to be healthy AND thin. 😉 Good luck everyone, I hope you find what works for you. Janene"
1,Able900,345,"Hello, Jenene. Welcome to the forum.“I will try and ween myself off Threelac and onto a regular probiotic later, but for now, I need something stronger.”Weaning yourself off of Threelac shouldn’t be a problem since it’s one of the weakest probiotics on the market. Able"
2,JaneneBean,345,"I disagree with you on that one. I’ve tried expensive health food store probiotics, cheap ones, good ones, NONE of them worked. This one actually DOES something. And NO, it’s not my diet because that didn’t work either. And NO, I didn’t just try it for a week. I was on the Candida diet for 8 months with NO results other than losing weight. I’m not taking ANY other supplements, only the Threelac. And low and behold, after one month I’m at least 50% better. You do the math. For a probiotic that is supposedly the weakest on the market, it sure has a TON of awesome reviews. My friend at work has a husband that was dying from Candida, he was on death’s door and he started using Threelac. In three months he was almost completely symptom free and still is. That was over a year ago. So don’t knock what worked for me. I’ve done my research on this product as well as all the other things people are doing for Candida. I’ve spent the last 11 months reading more information about this awful health issue than I care to even admit. It’s robbed me of my lively-hood.  I’m finally getting my life back and I wouldn’t be saying that if I didn’t start taking Threelac. Mysteriously, it only has a 2% return rate, so it must be doing something for several thousand people.  Also, before you accuse me of not sticking to the diet, don’t bother. When your butt itches like no tomorrow and is raw and painful, you’re not willing to risk more of that by eating the wrong food. I was so careful, I didn’t even eat things that “might” be okay. Six months of that with no improvement and I was willing to try cow poop if it helped. It was extremely rude of you to comment like that on my post. I’m trying to offer someone a bit of hope, not argue the effectiveness of Threelac. Go “poo poo” someone else’s post and leave mine alone."
3,WilliamHolst,345,Are you sure you just dont work for threelac?
4,JaneneBean,345,"Oh brother…. I thought I would be able to come on this forum and actually do some good by telling my story. Instead, I get this. NO, I don’t work for Threelac. What does that mean anyway? I bought it online from an ebay seller because they take paypal. I’m a cashier at the local grocery store in Idaho for pity sakes. What the heck is wrong with you?  Hey…whatever. If you don’t want to try it DON’T. I’m just saying that it’s working for me and many others. If you want to be stuck suffering from Candida symptoms for the rest of your pathetic life, go ahead. I personally don’t really want to live my life like that. It’s a miserable condition.  Apparently you don’t want to get better. Again…the Candida diet didn’t work for me. I don’t even suffer from the horrible Candida symptoms that some sufferers do, mine isn’t that bad. Yet, it still didn’t work. 10 months later after starting it and the only progress I’ve made is from Threelac. Make of it what you will. I don’t work for them. Geez!  This has got to be the worst Candida forum I’ve been on."
5,Able900,345,"“What the heck is wrong with you?”Nothing now, thank you, I’m fine. What WAS wrong is … I had a Candida albicans infestation and cured it; but not until I stopped taking Threelac after nearly three months and changed to a real probiotic with enough strains (14, not 3) and count (50 billion, not 1 1/2). You know… looking at those numbers, even at three doses a day, it’s no long looking ridiculous, but the more I look at it the more I laugh. Quite the joke.“Hey…whatever. If you don’t want to try it DON’T.”Already have. You know, as in, “been there done that wasted my money.” And it has nothing to do with me not wanting to try it, but rather it’s my intention to present other forum members with experienced facts which WILL and has cured the infestation as well as from wasting their money on expensive hype, because that’s all they’ll end up paying for, hype.“If you want to be stuck suffering from Candida symptoms for the rest of your pathetic life, go ahead…” See, all that tells us is that you’re one of those rare people (thank God) who come bouncing onto a forum without reading a single post first, but rather throwing the message out there “if you want to be stuck suffering from Candida symptoms for the rest of your life” to someone who was cured nearly ten months ago . We describe this type of action as “ignorant.”the Candida diet didn’t work for meIf you’ll bother to read just a few of the posts here, you’ll see that we’re all aware of the fact that there’s no diet which can cure the infestation. Impossible and quite ridiculous to even try it, so maybe you should have found this website first. If you truly wish to help others cure their Candida, I can tell you they’re quite the intelligent group of people. Just because someone has Candida doesn’t mean they’re stupid and have lost all sense of reasoning, so why are you telling these savvy people that the reason Threelac works is an apparent secret “dangerous ingredient”? That’s about the weakest reason for purchasing a supplement I’ve heard yet, and I’ve heard some real beauties. Able"
6,Javizy,345,"I don’t think it’s fair to judge an entire forum based on one thread you create and become aggressive in. I was hoping eliminating candida would reduce psychological symptoms like irritability and mood swings. A lot of people don’t like Threelac because it’s so overpriced and has such a low strain and CFU count considering that fact. You shouldn’t take criticism of a probiotic personally. Trying a higher count brand with more strains might even help you as well as save you some money. Keep in mind that many studies testing the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation use something in the region of 400-billion CFUs per day, and that many of the bacteria in your Threelac capsule will be dead before you swallow it, and more will die on the way to the colon. Anyway, I think a lot of people will be encouraged to read about your progress, so let’s chill out and try to learn from each other’s experiences. Unless that zero post-count means you’ve already deleted your account or something…"

8,JaneneBean,345,"Okay…I’ll bite. If Threelac isn’t enough, then tell me, WHAT IS? I’ve got limited resources and no I didn’t read posts on here before I joined. Who does? I don’t stalk forums before I join. I was just wanting some support. You want to know why I got defensive? Your remark about a product I’m taking having very little probiotic in it. You could have went about that in a more mature way. You could have just given me information about a better one that you’ve used and been encouraging rather than treating me like an idiot for even using it. I’m desperate. Of course I will try anything at this point. What do you expect?  Then someone else accuses me of selling the stuff! Again…what do you expect? I’m going to get annoyed and defensive. If you shove a snake in the corner and start poking it, don’t expect it to just roll over.  Plus, I belief certain things will work better with women than men. This is a condition that more women have than men from what I’ve read. You’ll probably discredit that statement too and try and make me look uneducated. I didn’t say I’ve read EVERYTHING there is on the topic, I’ve just spent WAY too much time researching a sickness that I’m tired of dealing with.  So…take off the sarcasm and belittling and I’ll gladly hear what probiotic you suggest."

Like you said, the diet alone isn’t enough, so it’s the things like probiotics and anti-fungals and resolving other health factors that get you to where you want to be.

When I act in this less than civilized manner on the forum I can promise you that it’s always about protecting the members. As you see, I have a big problem with Threelac as I’ve possibly read one too many pleas from new members about having spent their money on the product and coming here months later asking for help in curing their infestation. Will the product work in the beginning? Yes, it will in most cases as most supplements and even the diet itself work for a while simply because these are new to the Candida and they’ve not had time to adapt to it. If someone can show me how the company is justified in charging $49 or more for just three strains of bacteria, I imagine that I might be tempted to take back everything I’ve said about it, depending on the explanation, of course. You asked what I would recommend instead of Threelac. I would recommend the forum’s protocol.

13,Pattinoo,345,"I’m going to throw my 2 cents in here, well, because I can. I have to say I completely understand where Able is coming from. When I first read your post my thought was ‘salesperson’. Why? Because of your approach. When William wrote that, I thought, I agree. Then when you went on the defensive and then the offensive, attacking the forum and being able to state the return rate of your favorite supplement, it even seemed to support it more. Just sayin’. I don’t know anyone who knows the return rate of their favorite supplement though now that I say that who knows? I could be wrong. Any Of us could be. I consider myself fairly intelligent but without the time energy or interest at this point to be able to get into the exact science behind it all which is why I like Ables approach, no nonsense, here’s the info and here’s what backs it up. He gives out enough info to help things make sense that I can make an informed enough decision in my busy life. Here’s my problem with Threelac. Again, from doing a lot of reading of posts in various places. So i could be wrong. From What I read one of the 3 strains is Enteris something or other which a whole host of people felt made them more ill. I also read Threelac is not to be used for people with leaky gut. I don’t even know if I have it but lots of folks on here do and I’d hate to see a recommendation that could be detrimental to people. That’s exactly what I’ve witnessed Able, Raster and the other experts like Lucy Lauren and Orka do when helping others on here. Give people the best information that can help and let them know the risks of some if the others so people can then make informed and safe decisions. I appreciate a protected forum. With all that said, you’re saying you’re legit and I’ll take that as word at this time.

The bacteria you’re talking about is Enterococci or Enterococcus faecalis, and you’re right, the Threelac company made the decision to add this bacteria as one of only three strains that Threelac contains. A report offers this information;  “Enterococcus faecalis is a common cause of endocarditis and is known for its capacity to transfer antibiotic resistance to other pathogens.” Reported by the “Clinical Infectious Diseases,” 1992 from the Oxford University Press.

3,wishnhope,346,"thanks for the encouragement, guys. I’m currently in day 3 of the cleanse. It’s pretty awful 🙁 I threw up this morning after eating my eggs with spinach. I’m feeling weak, irritable, foggy.. already struggling. Hoping my molybdenum I ordered last week will arrive today 🙁 If I keep struggling to keep food down I think I’m going to add in kefir and maybe some tuna (can I even eat tuna? I’m unsure).. something with a little more substance than just veg. I’m hesitating to take any more coconut oil because i don’t want to associate the taste of it with being so sick as that usually turns me off a food for good. I was hoping to be able to accomplish 10 days of cleanse before starting, but I may have to just head straight into the phase 1 diet. sigh."
4,Able900,346,"To cut down on the die-off effect – which you definitely need to do since the toxins are dangerous to both your liver and kidneys – stop taking the coconut oil. You shouldn’t be taking it on the cleanse anyway as the cleanse alone is enough to produce severe die-off effects. Also, until the Molybdenum arrives, you should go ahead and add tuna to the diet to give you more strength considering how sick you’ve been. It’s actually taking a big chance in starting a strict cleanse before starting Molybdenum. I was hoping to be able to accomplish 10 days of cleanse before starting, but I may have to just head straight into the phase 1 diet.You should probably go ahead and move into the diet instead of the cleanse because of the severity of the toxic effect on your body. This is not helping anything at all. Able"
5,wishnhope,346,"Ok, I will think about doing that, Able. My liver/kidneys aren’t amazing to start with so perhaps the cleanse was a little bit ambitious on my part. If I do move right into phase 1, can I start having some coconut bread/oat bran right away? Or should I still wait the 2-3 weeks that is recommended in the protocol?"
6,wishnhope,346,just made myself a smoothie with 3/4 cup kefir (4 grams of sugar in it) and 3 frozen raspberries with a half teaspoon of stevia… no point in denying it. I couldn’t take the dizziness.. feeling a bit better now. not sure if i’ve set myself back 2 days but I think I will try to keep it to 90% veggies and some protein with a little bit of kefir mixed in and maybe 1 or 2 pieces of recommended bread per day (coconut or tef). I’m looking forward to the molybdenum. I teach elementary school and wasn’t anticipating quite how “flu-like” my flu-like symptoms would be.

You could go ahead and have those before you receive the Molybdenum. But if I were you, once you receive the Molybdenum I would forego those items for about two weeks during which time the diet can act as a mild cleansing diet which certainly can help your treatment.

8,wishnhope,346,So I got the molybdenum.. Big difference from yesterday (which I spent throwing up and sleeping when I came home sick from work). I’ve started taking the swedish bitters which are actually horrible tasting. Hopefully I’ll get used to them. I’ve been eating about 4x more veggies than I normally do and have added in a little bit of tuna packed in water and continue to eat a couple of hard boiled eggs and avocados which have been helpful. Looking forward to irritability going away and having some more energy.

I’m glad to hear that.I’ve started taking the swedish bitters which are actually horrible tasting. Hopefully I’ll get used to them. Believe it or not, most people usually get used to the bad taste. Personally, I’d rather take the bitters all day long than to have to go back to taking coconut oil by the spoonful, nothing on earth could be as bad as that was as far as I’m concerned. If you’ve not been told how to take the bitters, the info is below. Dosage: Since the principle of digestive bitters is to stimulate the bitter receptors you only need to taste the bitterness of the herbs to start this process, therefore 1/2 of a dropper full on the back of the tongue after meals will be enough to do the job, regardless of what the label may say. No matter what you read from here on out, you will not need to purchase additional enzymes as long as you use Swedish Bitters. Remember that you’ll need to take them before or immediately following a meal – followed by plenty of water throughout the day which is needed because of the flushing action of the bitters. If you think it’ll make you feel better about taking the ‘nasty’ bitters, read what happens in your body every time you take the bitters. • The stimulation of the flow of natural digestive juices from the exocrine glands of the mouth, stomach, pancreas, duodenum, and liver aid in good digestion as well as helping a range of conditions caused by inefficient or allergy-distorted digestion. • The flow of digestive juices triggers a stimulation of appetite. This is helpful in convalescence as well as in cases of appetite reduction and weight loss. • A range of liver activities is stimulated, including increased bile production and the release of bile from the gallbladder – all of this improves the health of both the liver and gallbladder. • Bitter remedies can trigger subtle psychological effects, even acting as mild antidepressants. For example, bitters can help lift the spirits in cases of post-viral-infection depression. • They help the central reflex to stimulate peristalsis, an action that moves wastes through the intestines through a series of muscular contractions. • Bitter also stimulate the intestinal wall’s self-repair mechanisms which is needed with IBS as well as Leaky Gut Syndrome which often happens with Candia infestations.Looking forward to irritability going away and having some more energy. That should happen within the next several days, hopefully. Able"
10,wishnhope,346,thanks Able.. it does actually make it seem a little easier to think of all the good that it’s doing! And I agree with you about the coconut oil by the spoonful thing!
11,wishnhope,346,"well, officially finishing day 6 of a (modified) cleanse. It’s more the strict diet I think as I have added in tuna packed in water occasionally as well as kefir in the mornings (sooooo good!). I’ve gotten used to the bitters after meals already so that has been really positive. Proud of myself for finding new ways of making different types of veg and you tube is my new best friend for figuring out how I’m supposed to cut and eat them. So far, aside from the rocky Tuesday that I had, I’ve been feeling ok. A little irritable and had a panic attack last night after an argument with a family member (sigh.. it’s been awhile since I last had one of those) but I was able to bring myself back into control within about 20 minutes which was good. Bloating has definitely gone down. Craving for sweets, breads, and lots of other foods definitely present but holding firm. I’m really missing my white wine and also gin martinis! sigh… Hoping my energy levels steady off soon so that I can go to the gym and do some (light) working out!"
12,Able900,346,"well, officially finishing day 6 of a (modified) cleanse.So today makes a week, congratulations!

Sorry in case I’m repeating myself to you, but if you’ve never heard of an herb called Ashwagandha, it’s worth looking into as a mood stabilizer, for low energy, and sleeplessness in general which can lead to depression.Bloating has definitely gone down. Craving for sweets, breads, and lots of other foods definitely present but holding firm.Just give the cravings a little more time, that really should already be lessening in intensity.I’m really missing my white wine and also gin martinis! sigh… Well that generated a bit of a chuckle as I remembered the good old days.

13,wishnhope,346,"Thanks for the encouragement, Able! I’m still on a very small dose of anxiety medication (cipralex) which I found helps me to manage my anxiety for the most part. I’m verrrrry slowly lowering my dose from 1 pill to a half, to a quarter, to a quarter every 2 days etc. It would be great to be off of that medication! (on a side note, I’ve also stopped taking birth control pills so my liver is going to have a bit of a break!) I had my first night out yesterday with a girlfriend and was surprised about how much fun I had! I had club soda (is this ok to drink? hope so!) with a couple of slices of lemon while she drank her beer and gin and tonics. I had tonnes of energy (from adding some vitamins in to my schedule yesterday? maybe from the piece of coconut bread I decided to try out?) and I was in a great mood. It’s funny that I noticed a difference because usually when I go have a few drinks I start to feel a bit sick (bloated, uncomfortable feeling, skin goes red) but this time I had none of that. Yay for day 8 starting today! From last Sunday I have lost 1.5 inches from my waist and weight has gone down 6.8 pounds. Pretty sweet side effect! (but going to make sure to stay on the coconut bread a couple of times of day as well as the rest of my veggies and kefir and eggs and add in a tiny bit of organic chicken) has anyone every breaded their organic chicken with the crumbs left in the pan from the coconut bread? It seems a shame to toss them so I have them in a little bag. I think I’m going to give it a go! 🙂 -wnh"

I apologize for my spelling and grammar errors. Thank you. – Nadja Nadja, Candida Related Complex (CRC) is a syndrome caused by an intestinal/genital fungal overgrowth because the body has lost the ability of keeping the yeast under control. The overgrowth can occur slowly since candida is an opportunistic microbe that get any chance to gain terrain. Most of the time, it is something that appear because a combination of factors and triggered by antibiotic use, bad diet, stress, an a LOADED immune system. The big concentration occur in the intestines and this steal the immune ability of clean other parts of the body. In other words, what make impossible to overcome other chronic fungal focus in the body is the intestinal overgrowth. It is responsible of having a suppressed immune system since the fungal metabolites and toxic wastes are absorbed in the intestines causing damage to the body. You need to focus in lowering or eradicating the intestinal overgrowth. When you be reaching progress, you will see how the rest of the body is also cleaning the fungus gradually. Candida has conquered our immune ability of attacking it because its presence for enough time in our tissues. Its long presence in big amounts has caused immune tolerance to it. Common sense points that lowering this amount for long time will bring back the immune restoration and activity against it that enjoy healthy people. Follow an smart protocol, a good diet, and over time you will see how you health will return to a normal state. This need discipline and perseverance. The diet is very important because if the fungus eat, it will be almost impossible to lower its amount. Current antifungals have many limitants.  During the protocol, you may need to do other kind of corrections such as deal with parasites, intolerance, allergies, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Keep your hope. If you are disciplined, it will pay you. We are here to help. ! Jorge."

I am not smoking anymore, I stopped 3 years ago 🙂 I have allergies to some things. Both food and pollen. What do you do if you are invited to a birthday or something similar? I have been invited to a birthday in 2 weeks I can not cancel."
4,shell,347,Hi Nadja I would bring your own food. What I tell everyone is that I have allergies and that I have to be very careful. It is kind of the truth and no one ever asks me to try their food again. 🙂 Good luck. shell

6,Lorelei,347,Here’s a good post on things to try to alleviate the symptoms of the v. yeast infection.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst435_What-helped-me-cure-my-vaginal-yeast-infections.aspx And a story of someone who did heal.
7,NadjaB,347,"Thank you Lorelei. It is a really good post, and it has given me some more inspiration. ."
8,raster,347,"I personally wouldn’t start eating fruits regularly until stage 2. The Mccoomb’s plan is one that allows food in the diet, but we discourage it because fruits contain sugar. If you do eat fruits, I would start out eating blueberries (which are anti-inflammatory) and apples occasionally. Strawberries would be a good one to add later in the diet. You need to keep the overall sugar levels low in general while your immune system recovers. It can take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth. I have been on the diet for 9 months and only recently started to eat fruits more often. I have been eating blueberries throughout the diet and about 2 green apples per month or so (until recently). Going on this diet is like peeling the layers off of an onion. Each layer that is removed is a symptom that you get over with and eventually there will be nothing left to remove. After 1-4 months you should feel a lot better and after 4-6 months you can have a few more food items. Keep in mind that your health problems might not all be completely related to candida and will need to address those seperately (examples include adrenal fatigue, parasites, etc). -raster"
9,mstewart,347,"NadjaB, I had a lot of problems with vaginal yeast infections, that coincided with my cycles. It was so bad I had open sores and have a husband who I wanted to make love to but couldn’t. I had a vaginal yeast infection every month from July to November. I was also put on Diflucan and it did no good. When I started the diet things got worse before they got better. For me I had a yeast infection for 2-3 weeks straight. But it has gotten better and I am about 4 months in and things are so much better. I still sometimes will get the “itchy feeling” but nothing lasts for more than a couple days. But you have to stick to the diet. It is hard at first, but it will get easier!"
10,NadjaB,347,"Okay then.. I need to make my condition much better before i start adding high sugary things like fruits. I have read a lot of books at my own language, and they all say that you can add new foods after 4-8 weeks(!). Very much different from this site. And here you can also eat ½ banana or 1 green apple a day. But I will stick to the website in first place, to see how fast I will get better. This website is very strict, but I guess the cure will be working much better then. Even though it is hard not eating sugar, and I am only at day 2. I guess it is just sugar cravings. I could eat a whole slab of chocolate right now. Wauv Mstewart. That do not sound pleasant. I am so happy for you! Open sores? Auch.. My condition is not that bad at all at the moment. “Just” burning and itching. But very much stronger burning if I try to be toghether with my boyfriend, who is also very sad because of this. I will stick to it! My friend has asked me out for dinner, and I do not like to say no, but I know I have to. But I do not know what to say? I can not say it is because I have a vaginal yeast infection and it hurts and itches. That would be very uncomfortable to me. By the way, I am 18. What do you do in thoose situations?"
11,raster,347,"Well, I would look at how long it takes to recover from candida overgrowth. It can take as long as 6-18 months to fully recover from candida overgrowth. I have been on the diet for 9 months and only recently started to add fruits. I was allergic to just about everything from potatoes to all fruits. Not everyone is as ill as me, but don’t expect a quick recovery where you get over this in a matter of weeks. For most of us, it’ll be a very long process until you go back to regular foods. When people invite me out, I just eat a salad or only go to a place where they serve salads. A banana contains approximately 25g of sugar and will feed candida. You’ve mentioned other foods that you are eating that feed candida as well. If you want to go ahead and eat fruits and items from stage 2 of the diet the whole time, it will only lengthen your recovery. It also may not cause much die off; you want to kill the candida, right? -raster"
12,NadjaB,347,"Oh, may be I can get rid of some of my allergies too.. Okay, I will wait with bananas. Which foods do I eat that feed candida? I did not know. According to http://www.thecandidadiet.com/foodstoeat.htm I am eating the things I should?"
13,raster,347,"I would not refer to the website at all as far as how to get better. It has a good framework and information, but it is too lenient as far as what to do to get better. Check out the forum’s allowed food list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1136_ALLOWED-FOODS-LIST.aspx We don’t even recommend eating rice! The goal is to completely eliminate sugar as much as possible, and sugar is found in almost all fruits.

Here’s the protocol: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx If you want to cure your allergies, food sensitivities, and yeast infection, I would examine every food item you are eating and determine whether it contains high amounts of sugar, starch, or both. -raster"

Lots of love to you all, Lauren I am so happy for you, that is great news. I had Juvenile Psoriatic Polyarticular Rheumatoid Arthritis from 7-18yr and was on drugs for it, and without the drugs that I was prescribed I personally would have been much worse off. I had no long lasting effects of the debilitating disease RA I also never experienced and deforming of my joints. The disease went into remission right after high school for me (now 23 as of today my birthday) and I am so glad to be off the many, many different drugs, but without those drugs, and sometimes extreme therapies I could have been a totally different person. I totally agree for some people a natural approach does have its place, but when it is a serious medical condition that requires proper treatment because of how quickly the disease can set in, which is often irreversible. Sometimes you must forego the natural approach, you could also go natural and western medicine simultaneously. It is just not worth it to live in severe pain every minute of your life, now matter how wrong you think it is, or how it will effect you later in life, quality of life is a major factor to myself. Just my two cents. P.s. check out the SD thread I have a question for you"
2,Lauren,348,"Blake, I am very your happy Juvenile Psoriatic Polyarticular Rheumatoid Arthritis is in remission!!! That is wonderful!! I totally agree with what you said :D. That is why I am so happy about this doctor. He uses both approaches and checks for underlying factors such as infections. Though this does not mean that everyone that has problems has a underlying infection. He also believes there are things that cannot be fix naturally and you need medicine. He is respected by doctors on both sides (natural and more western approach). Thank you for your thoughts!! And again I am very happy for you!!! Lots of love to you, Lauren"

0,BellusStella,350,"I heard about the candia/yeast buster diet for the first time a few months ago from some girlfriends who did it for about 1 month or so. I was curious and asked a bunch of questions. Then I started doing research and found this site and I said to myself, What have I got to lose? Another 10 years of feeling crappy? I don’t think so. I must add, I’ve also read The Yeast Connection by William G. Crook. It is a must for anyone doing this diet! Here a bit of my history: As far as I can remember, I’ve been treated with anti-biotic for everything and anything when i was a child. When I started dating my first boyfriend in 2001, I started taking birth control pills and within 3 months, the symptoms started to appear. I had Vulvodynia but of course I only found out what it was many years after. In the following years, I tried changing pills 3 times, even tried the Nuvaring. Finally in 2009, I just stopped the pills altogether and within a month, the symptoms started disappearing. It wasn’t until then that I realised that my body was obviously reacting to the hormones. Also, by then, my weight gain was also out of control. In 2005, hay fever and cat allergies appeared. In 2007, I was officially diagnosed with Celiac disease; it took about 1 1/2 year of different testing and different Dr. to figure it out but who knows how long all of it started?! Needless to say that all this affected greatly my relationship; which ended in March 2010. It was time I took my health into my own hand. I started making healthy food choices, exercising and started seeing a Naturopath, since my family Dr. was NO help at all. When I met my current boyfriend, I restarted the pill and the symptoms came back right away. I stopped them after two months. No way was I going through all that again and ruining another relationship. But even though, I stopped the pills, I still had the other symptoms, always tired, acne/hives, itchy throat/running nose, often moody, horrible sweet cravings, tummy aches, etc… even If i was following a gluten-free diet to the letter. Up until last week, I just felt like I reacted to EVERYTHING I ate. The book that I mentioned on top basically describes it as “feeling sick all over” which is how I felt every day. Since 2010, I’ve lost 63 lbs and I exercise regularly and I’m hoping to lose another 20-30lbs. So now, some people would say I should feel amazing, well I just don’t. Clearly it’s a sign that something is wrong! I’m on day 6 of this diet and I must say, this last week was hard. The die-off symptoms where just plain mean. I went out to purchase Milk Thistle on day 4 and it has help a lot. I met with my Dr. on day 2 and told her about all this diet and she basically brushed it off and said she didn’t believe in anything she didn’t learn in her practice. My Naturopath has been an amazing help so if anyone is in a similar situation with your family Dr., I suggested find a local Naturopath! They are more than willing to help and they are open-minded! Now, before I started doing the diet I was regularly going to the bathroom but since I started adding so much fibre with the detox drinks and the veggies, I haven’t been since it’s created a blockage. All week, I felt bloated and really gassy which was super uncomfortable. I decided to reduce the detox drinks to 1 a day and increase my water intake, even though I was drinking plenty before. I’m still trying to find a menu that works for me. Baking isn’t a problem and working with the different flours as been really easy since I’m Celiac and most of the bread/flours that you have to cut out, I didn’t have in my house anyways. I use to eat my fruits for breakfast and my morning snacks, that is what I’m having a hard time with. I don’t really crave them, I just don’t know what to replace them with, I find it weird to eat veggies for breakfast, and I feel like I’m eating a whole lot of carbs then I should. Regardless, I’m positive I will find balance and this diet is finally the cure to a healthier me and I can’t wait to feel normal again!A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step. – Confucius "

I also do brown rice, oatmeal and quinoa (not everyday). i also eat a lot of the Mary’s Crackers. I try to control the portions but i just feel like i eat a lot. Almost every time i go to the kitchen, i sneak a piece of the coconut bread or when i baked the zucchini muffins, i think i ate 5 in 2 days. I also exercise 4 to 5 times a week so i need food to sustain my workouts and i find if i dont eat carbs, i dont stay full as long. Another thing that worries me are food allergies. Since i’m Celiac, the last thing i need is to have to cut out a food group. I eat a lot of nuts as well so i need to figure some sort of calendar and rotate my food every 4 days or so, but its hard when im so limited in what i can eat! As for a little update, i decided to stop the drinks on this website and purchased the yeast buster kit; im now on my second week. The worse of my die-off symptoms is the depression. My boyfriend was watching an episode of Scrubs (a baby episode) yesterday and i thought I was going to start crying! LOL I had to get up and do something else to change my mind.  I started doing Bikram (Hot Yoga) last week and it has help greatly with the die-off but the days i’m not doing the yoga are the worse."

Ill do my best to cut out as much as possible the rice in the next few days and see how that goes. Any suggestions of what I can replace it with? I’m guessing if i cut it out for a few weeks, then i can slowly reintegrate it afterwards? I eat Bob’s Red Mill Oats. Today is the first day where my die-off symptoms are much more tolerable. Feels great! Thanks for taking the time and sharing some feedback. Very appreciated!"

Mary’s Gone Crackers The oatmeal that you are using looks great, and might be a food item to reintroduce in due time. But for now I would say its too heavy a food. And its a grain that contains sugars which do not help your progress. Especially in this early stage. But keep it in mind for tryouts later. I tend to differ on the issue of brown rice as I once temporarily cured my candida within 2 months while eating almost only brown rice. But everyone is different and you should listen to your body if you have any reaction to it."
8,Able900,350,"Bellus; Rolled or steel cut oats are not what you want. On the other hand, Bob’s Red Meal Oat Bran is acceptable as are “raw oats groats.” The oat bran carried by BRM is a good source of prebiotic, and the groats contain a substance called ‘chitinase’ which is a powerful antifungal. It causes the Candida to break open leaking out the cell membrane, and in the right circumstances, is capable of causing a massive amount of die-off. So you definitely don’t want eat these unless you’re taking Molybdenum Amino Acid Chelate. You’ll also need to soak the groats in water before cooking.

Now it just feels like I have no energy, massive brain fog, lack of concentration… :/ What does the soaking do beforehand?

0,charliecrich,351,I have a 12 year old son that has one of the worst cases of systemic Candida the doctors have ever seen in a child. He is on very high doses of Lamitril..just started yesterday. We are experiencing insane reactions.

What we all are suffering and battling is enough to break an adult men. I can tell you that the rage is not against you or your wife but the rage against the fungus. I am 49 years old and was very stable in mind but twice I broke down in-front of my wife crying and being a hopeless wreck after a one year intensive struggle to get rid of the beast. One experience the worst kind of reactions and die-offs and would love to jump out of ones own body but cannot. This can lead to depression or in the combination of bodily suffering and not being able to escape to panic attacks or aggression. His flight or fight nervous system is affected and I have seen that. For me its flight and not being able to run off I get panic. Luckily I am not 12 years old and found a teacher called Byron Katie and was able to channel these thought patterns and energies. I really hope that the medication will help him. Please check with the doctors why they think he got it. Was he under antibiotics for a while. If not you have to find a nutritionist to help you with a diet for a child. He will have to learn to eat healthy, not helping the candida to come back. all the best to you, your son and your family yours thomas"

3,charliecrich,351,I’m sorry I meant Lamisil.. it is a very potent anti-fungal. The strain my son has is resistant and Diflucan did nothing to kill the Candida strain he has. After a lot of research I believe the neurotoxin’s released in Die-off is a large part of the problem. I am researching the use of Molybdenum to help with that. I am looking at the liquid version for maximum absorption and utilization.

If the specie is affecting him is resistant to Fluconazole, the Dr. should find another alternative. I also don’t believe he has any systemic fungal infection and be at home as I assume. In any case of systemic fungal infection, hospitalization with parental drugs are necessary. Candida Glabrata and Candida Krusei are the most resistant to Fluconazole. Did he have a culture to identify the specie ??? By the way, Terbinafine used together with Fluconazole has demonstrated a synergistic activity against resistant Fluconazole strains. http://www.doctorfungus.org/thedrugs/terbinafine.php http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC95798/ Jorge."
5,Able900,351,"I’m sorry I meant Lamisil.. it is a very potent anti-fungal. Thank you.  Most of us here made use of Molybdenum for at least the first few months of our treatment to protect the liver and body in general from the toxins.  The following is information that I’ve found concerning children and Molybdenum. “Children—Problems in children have not been reported with intake of normal daily recommended amounts.” Depending on your son’s age as well as size, such as smaller than average, average, and larger than average, you could use the following suggestions for a dosage. •	Infants and children—  o	Birth to 3 years of age: 15 to 50 micrograms (mcg). o	4 to 6 years of age: 30 to 75 mcg. o	7 to 10 years of age: 50 to 150 mcg. •	Adolescents and adults—75 to 250 mcg. I’m sure you’ll notice that the dosage is measured in mcg’s and not in MG’s. I can state with confidence that, if I were trying to help my child with this problem, I would reduce or stop the dosage of the Lamisil immediately regardless of what the doctor recommends. Just because a man has the letters M.D. after his name doesn’t make him the best judge for what is right for your son. This ‘doctor’ apparently has no idea of the dangers of Candida and especially their toxins as far as what they can do to a human. For your son’s symptoms to be this severe, the aldehyde toxins are bound to be causing havoc with his organs, and this is what I would address first. You can always kill the Candida; and there are many safer ways of doing this than using powerful doses of prescription antifungals. Good luck to you, and please keep us posted on your son’s condition if you will. Able"
0,shell,352,"Hi I have been reading over posts trying to figure out how far I should go with the candida cleansing and antifungal drugs etc. As I stated in my subject bar I suffer from recurrent v. yeast infections. It has been going on for a few years and I have been doing a variety of things to get rid of it. I live in Canada and my doctors have never heard of the tests mentioned on the web page. I have seen a naturalpath who put me on a candida diet but it was not very strict and really did nothing after a year on it. Then I went to see yet another medical doctor who told me that I needed diflucan. So I took it just a few times then started using bio identical progesterone cream. It worked! After a few months I relaxed on my diet, began eating sugar and drinking the odd beer/wine etc. Well needless to say, it came back. After Christmas it was far worse than ever.

1,Marbro,352,"I canst answer you question about nystatin but your doctors advice might be worth trying. “Most women––as many as 75 percent––will have at least one diagnosis of vaginal yeast infection during their lifetimes.” “About 5 to 8 percent of women develop recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), defined as four or more symptomatic vaginal yeast infections during a 12-month period.” http://www.healthywomen.org/condition/yeast-infections Its not a uncommon issue so Though many may not agree with how doctors treat it, it is something they treat often. I would say, there is no quick fix to RVVC and you have to really dig in and change your approach to your diet. While your trying to decide what to do, you can start by eliminating as much sugar and processed foods as possible. I am sorry I couldn’t answer you question nystatin, hopefully one of the more experienced folks here on the forum will get around to it soon enough. The protocol outlined on this forum has proven successful for some folks and it certainly something you should consider. As you mentioned diflucan gave you a quick fix but not a long term one. That will take a dietary change and commitment."

3,wishnhope,352,what is nystatin? Is it like a drug or a supplement? Do I need a prescription? Does it work like diflucan?
4,shell,352,Nystatin is an antifungal drug and I do need a prescription to get it but that may not be the same in other countries.
5,Lorelei,352,"Hello Shell – I am currently on a treatment plan with an MD (Yes, a real medical doctor!) who treats candida overgrowth. I have battled yeast infections on and off for the last 3 years. In 2010 I was on a 3 to 4 month treatment with Diflucan, but the candida came back after 6 months or so. The treatment plan I am following is this:  – Anti candida diet – the docs plan is not so stringent but I follow the protocol on the forum – 1 month of 200 mg of diflucan.I’ll be done with it tomorrow. – followed by 1 month of Nystatin – keeping the diet the whole time. – I also received candida antigen drops that I take 3 x a day. (one small drop.) I did stop the drops for a week or so because my symptoms were coming back and sometimes the doc recommends to take a break from them.  – A really good probiotic. I take 2 types of probiotics together, at night – 50 billion total. I don’t know if the Nystatin will fix everything, but I can report back as I take it.  With the diflucan and diet, I can say that I feel 50% better. But I did have two episodes of a near V. yeast infection breakout while taking the diflucan. (so I’m pretty sure there is resistance.) I also continue to take natural antifungals. Right now I am taking sf722 3 times a day. When I start the Nystatin, I will switch back to oregano oil. I read somewhere in a study that the combination of Nystatin and Oregano oil is very powerful. Good Luck"
6,shell,352,thank you lorelei! I am feeling a little nervous about the nystatin but I am still going to give it a try. My “holistic pharmacist” gave me the plan and I am going to trust him for now as he is the only professional in my area that seems to know what he is talking about. He is a regular pharmacist that has trained outside of his profession in women’s health. He is constantly away for medical conventions etc. and bringing back the info to our small town. The latest he told me is that I do not need a high count in my probiotics because they have discovered that it is more important what is in it and the percentages of each in relation to each other. Apparently in shipping many of the good bacteria cancel each other out and by the time you get them they are not what they say on the bottle. Even the ones kept cold. He is away again right now and will be back tomorrow so I will find out more from him then. I will post whatever I learn. shell
0,immunetroubles,353,"My Doc in Boston had ordered a urine test for candida thru Great Plains Lab in Kansas, a very specilaized lab that does some unusual tests. He told me to go off my anti-fungals for a week or two prior to the test. I was so sick that I was afraid to go off all the way, I just cut down by quite a bit (this was before I started the diet). Just got the results back and they’re no surprise to me: high yeast/fungal metabolites….even while on anti-fungal medicines in large amounts. Since starting the diet, I have cut back significantly on pharmalogical anti-fungals, and have the first bit of relief I’ve had from this infection in over a year. My problem is that I keep eating a little bit of sugary junk once in a while (with immediate return of symptoms). I’ve so altered my diet from before, I’m sure you all know what I mean, but even a small amount of sugar totally sets me back, not to the beginning, but starts me having symptoms again. Sigh. Just have to keep to this diet 100%! ITs tough. I need a 12 step program or something! Lynda"
1,raster,353,"I am sorry to hear about your positive test results! I guess its a good thing to know what exactly is the problem with your body…not everyone goes and gets a test to get a positive result. If you want to get better faster, you should consider “sweating” out the toxins via the skin, the bodies largest organ. You can do hot tubs, steam rooms, jacuzzi, hot tub, or even hot bath to sweat out the toxins. This can significantly reduce or eliminate die-off symptoms. After you get to about the 4 months point, you will be teatering towards feeling really good most of time instead of feeling bad; it all takes time but eventually your body will heal. This is if you heal at the same pace as myself who also had it really bad. I highly recommend trying out my teff bread recipe underneath the coconut bread recipe for nutritional properties during your time on the diet. Its a difference maker for me between having too little and too much energy. -raster"
2,Marbro,353,"If your stuggeling with the sweet tooth,I highly recommend trying both Xylitol or Stevia. The stevia I list comes in a little packets and it last a long time for the price. The xylitol i list is more expensive but a very good natural sugar subsitute. It will not replace the process foods that come with sugar but it will help with the sweet tooth. Adding it to something like Oat bran is a nice breakfast. http://www.amazon.com/SweetLeaf-Sweetener-70-Count-Packets-2-5-Ounce/dp/B003WO0I6C/ref=sr_1_sc_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330994097&sr=8-1-spell http://www.amazon.com/Xylosweet-Xylitol-Sweetener/dp/B005TKVU64/ref=sr_1_1?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1330994128&sr=1-1"
3,Lauren,353,"Lynda, I am sorry that you have a bad infection. Your not alone 😀 Knowing this helped me. I know it can be difficult especially when other people think it is okay if you cheat a little. It gets easier with time because your taste buds do change. What helps me when everyone else is having a treat is thinking the if I ate anything bad I would be hurting my body and after words I would be disappointed with myself. Being healthy is wroth giving any type of food. When I do get a sweet craving I will have something with stevia in it (check out the recipe section for snacks on the forum). You can do this!! I know you can because I have and I use to live for sweet things. Another thing that helps me is thinking about all the people in the world that would kill just to have a meal, yet I feel bad because I can’t have something I want. You are in my thoughts,  Lots of love to you, Lauren"
4,shell,353,"Lynda I know how you feel about the sugar craving. It is like I don’t have an off switch. I managed a candida diet -though not this one- and I did get rid of all my symptoms. Then I relaxed and began to eat, drink etc. and the symptoms came back. Now I am back at the beginning trying for a second time to get through this. It may help to think about it from that angle.

I would feel more then happy to share my knowledge with you because I have had lack of willpower when it comes to dealing with Candida overgrowth for a very long time.

0,CandiGirl,354,"Hello everyone,  I’ve finally come to grips with the fact that my life will never be the same. I have severe Candida, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue. Yeah, I’m a mess! I’ve probably gained 20 plus lbs over the last 6 months. I’m limited when it comes to exercise because of the Fibro but my inactivity is only part of my weight problem. I’ve been tested and the Candida is all over my body even my brain… inflammation and bloating everywhere. I don’t know what to do. Well I do, kinda. I just can’t seem to do it. I keep trying to do the Candida diet only to fail each time. At this moment I’m so disappointed in myself because I was doing well since Sunday (5 days) only to binge on some chocolate cookies that my husband had in the cupboard. I ate like 10!!! I just couldn’t stop. I really need some direction and support. I hope and pray that this forum will help me. Seriously, I can’t do this alone and I want to heal more than anything else.

1,Allira,354,"Oh you poor thing! I’ve been where you are many many many times (with previous diets) I did the candida diet for about 8 weeks in July, got excellent results, then thought I can handle anything, ate some chocolate, then bread, then went back to my old ways and after a few months… all my symptoms returned 🙁 This time around I have accepted that, although I don’t plan to stay on the strict diet forever, I can’t eat any of my favourites (CHOCOLATE) anymore and I am in fact allergic to them 🙁 sugar is so addictive, for me its like smoking, i can’t just have one puff (or bite in the case of sugar), I end up addicted. (in fact i found giving up cigarettes easier than I ever have with sugar!!) I’m not sure exactly if I have a candida infestation, I’m doing this diet for psoriasis, which apparently can be really helped by anti candida diets. It definitely helped me last time, and already at the end of week 2 my skin is looking better. What keeps me going and stops me from eating (and I have 2 young boys so trust me, temptation is around all the time!) is the discomfort of psoriasis and the embarrassment physically, i remind myself how awful it feels, and that no tasty treat is worth feeling like shite all the time! And also the thought of going back to square one with the detox and die off is enough to keep me on track! If I was you I would ask hubby to hide any treats like the chocolate biscuits away from you. Good luck!"
2,Tina,354,I feel your pain! I agree with the previous comment that it is really important to keep your eyes on the prize. Living with chronic fatigue and pain in addition to other candida symptoms is no way to live. I have a very similar situation to you with symptoms and it became so debilitating that I had no choice. It is my third week and it is really tough but worth the reward. The best thing that I have found is to be prepared. Have acceptable snacks availble so that you don’t feel tempted to cheat. There are grain free cracker recipes on elanaspantry that are great with nut butter. Also her almond flour pancakes are great…I add cinnamon for a sweeter flavor. Cocnut yogurt ( homemade) is simple and rich it’s like a desert. I know it’s scary but the reward is so worth it. Take it one day at a time and prepare yourself with recipes. Good luck to you! You can do it! Keep imagining your life pain free with lots of energy. 🙂
3,CandiGirl,354,"Thank you both so very much! @Allira, sugar really is addictive! I’ve been in denial. I realize now that I’m an addict. (You know what they say about the first step to recovery… maybe I’m on my way) I will definitely ask my husband to help me out by not leaving his snacks in the house, great suggestion. So, no chocolate ever, huh? WOW! This is going to be such a challenge. I’m up for it, though. I want to heal. @Tina, you know that’s exactly where I messed up. I forgot to bring my snack and got way too hungry. When I returned home I went crazy. I must be prepared at all times. Thanks for the info. I will check out those recipes. I’m doing my best to imagine myself healthy. You know, I used to be SO good at visualizing and creating things in my life. But, I can’t lie, since being hit with these illnesses 3 years ago it’s been DIFFICULT to see anything good happening for me, especially being in good health. At times, I wonder if I’ll ever be. People use to say the I was the most positive person they knew. Now, I’m sure I’m the most negative. My faith and confidence in myself is weak. But,I will continue to try. Thanks again for your support, ladies. I truly appreciate it. You don’t know how happy I feel to know that there are people who understand and don’t just think I’m nuts! 🙂"

I want more than anything to be rid of this candida and leaky gut. I will eat any kind of diet that I think will help. I’ve been eating mainly just veggies, meat., quinoa and lentils. The snack that helps alleviate sugar cravings is raw cashew butter on brown rice cakes. That is about the only thing that does the trick. I’ve been following this diet for over 10 months and I’ve seen some improvement, but not as much as I’d like. I still get horrible pain in my back and legs. I still get overwhelmingly tired and I still have brain fog and lethargy.

0,Jman310,355,"Ok so i’ll make this brief: I believe I have been suffering from Candida for 2 1/2 years now… Originally after having a nervous breakdown in class i noticed something different, for some reason I had a lot of gas every time I ate certain foods and gas would kind of escape me… At first I thought that this was due to anxiety, and I became devastated. I couldn’t sit in class any longer without experiencing cramps and gas course through my digestive track, it just SUCKED! Even though it was hard I somehow managed to get through school and continue with a social life, noticing that exercise helped reduce the symptoms. I took antidepresents but got off of them pretty soon realizing that they weren’t helping. I was lost for awhile not knowing where to turn; I then decided last year I would figure this out on my own and did a series of google searches, that’s when I found out about the Candida Diet. I researched all I could about the candida diet and soon started the cleanse. This was hard but I knew the benefits would be great if I did it. So I started a colon cleanse and followed the strict candida diet. I experienced the symptoms of die off (headache, dizzyness, and sickness) just a day or two after eliminating sugar from my diet. Although it was hard I dieted for 3 weeks and noticed a significant different in my digestive tract. I succumbed to the craving and after 3 weeks of dieting I filled my belly with a BLT and chips. After that I slowly started getting off the diet but found myself experiencing the symptoms again from time to time (especially when I drank) Oddly though when I would take ecstasy I noticed my symptoms alleviate all together. (I’ve only taken ecstasy a few times in my life, don’t worry) I do remember doing research and finding that anxiety can partially contribute to candida overgrowth and symptoms, due to sugar being released when anxious thus feeding the candida. So to relieve stress and anxiety I upped up my exercise regime. Now take into note I had my doubts whether or not this was candida or anxiety the whole time, but i’ve always leaned more on my symptoms being candida overgrowth related. (due to having a mild anxiety attack in class and succumbing to depression, which is a time candida can take over). Over the summer I got some probiotics and they’ve definitely been helping. Yet my symptoms still seem to be somewhat there, although the first cleanse definitely did help. I noticed after my first cleanse the symptoms I initially had never returned with as much intensity as the initial occurrence. I thought about doing a second cleanse back in September but only lasted 4 days. I’ve had days where symptoms don’t occur (take note I take probiotics on a daily basis) while other times the symptoms would grow kind of bad. I’m lactose intolerant and after accidentally eating a cheeseburger that I thought was a hamburger I had some pretty bad gas, uncontrollable… So I decided something needed to be done. Jumpfoward to today, I started the diet about 2 weeks ago. (this monday will mark day 14) After the first couple of days of cleansing I got a headache, became fatigued, and the usual, except this time I got a rash all over my thighs and over my body. Although this didn’t happen until this week, week 2. Take note that this rash could be from a new body wash I started using this week as the rash is only in all of the places where I washed myself with this new body wash) So yeah that’s kind of my story, it’s a little mixed up and I left A LOT out but that’s pretty much the gist of it. I’ve suffered for 2 1/2 years and I think it’s time to eradicate this overgrowth once and for all. So my diet for the last 2 weeks has consisted of eggs, green beans, brown rice, chicken, broccoli, celery, almond milk, almonds, and ground beef (packaged) I remember reading online that the probiotic saccharomyces boulardii was a GREAT probiotic to combat a candida overgrowth so i’ve been taking two of these a day since Thursday. (I was previously on another probiotic until this one arrived in the mail). I feel like my diet hasn’t been all too beneficial to what I need. Although I have noticed a complete difference in my gas levels (which is pretty much the only thing that bugs me candida-wise) over the past few months I have noticed that I do get a lot of discomfort in my wind pipe. I get this intense pain sometimes and a doctor on campus said it could be attributed to gas build up. (And since Candida gives me gas you see I have to get rid of it) My questions are: So how have I been doing on my diet? Should I have not included rice so early? And i’ve been getting packaged ground beef, which has been one of my primary food items, should it not be packaged? I’m pretty sure this ground beef is fresh, but I read to not eat sealed meats so I’m not so sure anymore. As i’ve somewhat stated I do exercise on the regular and i’m somewhat athletic I guess you could say. On my best days I swim for 30min, and do another 40-50min of cardio. (run, bike, elliptical) I notice my symptoms go down when I exercise and the more I get into shape. I also notice when I do a lot of sit ups and build up my abs that my symptoms go away. This honestly makes me want to get into shape and get a six pack. (To seriously get rid of candida, would this help/work?) Thanks for all of the advice ahead of time, I appreciate it."

3,Marbro,355,"Get rid of the brown rice, that is feeding the candida. Buy quinoa to replace it. It cooks up like rice and can be used like rice for stir fries or whatever rice dish you are now making. The beef is bad for the diet this early but if your going to to eat it anyways make sure it is organic with nothing added. I have been a huge meat and bread eater all my life and that’s been the hardest. But I have made do with BBQ Cornish game hens and chicken. You can make sausage with the dark meat of the chicken and that helps with meat cravings. I can find cheap whole young chicken at most of the grocery stores with no harmones, free range at around 6 bucks here in Washington. I get a couple of those a week and make gravy, stock and meals. The almond milk if store bought and name brand is most likely feeding the candida. It should have nothing added. I can’t find that in the stores so I do not use it. I have gotten use to kefir milk and make dessert and drinks with that instead."

Thanks a lot, this is the biggest thing that gets to me. I notice it almost disappear completely within 2-3 weeks on a diet of no sugar but it can be hard to follow such a strict diet at times. I do feel anxiety is a minor factor but only when I can feel the gas course through me, and it just SUCKS. I don’t know how I pull off having a decent social life but I will say this condition definitely holds me back having an intimate relationship. I had 2 over the summer and occasionally make out with girls (I am in college) but it still holds me back a lot. I choose not to go out at times because i’m embarrassed, and I know I would have no anxiety if this condition wasn’t in me. You might want to try doing as many sit ups as you can every day. I find that this helps a lot, along with a good cardio workout. I’ve noticed the more I get into shape the less the FBO occurs.

If you’re up to it and your doctor is fine with it try and truly get into shape. I mean feel the burn from running or swimming, i noticed to more fat I burn the less the symptoms come. I’ve gotten over anxiety at the gym, even at school because people smell anyway when they work out so who cares. If you can’t go to the gym then at least try to jog/run outside and do sit ups and push ups when you have some privacy. Also try and relieve as much stress as you can in your life, I find this helps as well. So take warm showers and do a bit of meditation, let the warm water soothe your body. The steam is also good for your pores as well. Also I pleasure yourself, this helps relieve stress and helps you forget about what’s wrong. In the end keep positive and remember we’re in a first world country, at least we have food and can live. There are people out there who have it worse and worry about not having enough food or safety in their own homes. Good luck"
0,carla mc,356,"i’m a few months away from another hip replacement. my hope was to have the yeast licked by then, but it’s feeling unlikely now. feeling kind of ‘stuck’ on stage one, lacking protein (i’m a vegetarian who can only tolerate eggs in the coconut bread) and it’s almost like i’m looking for excuses to go off the diet.(although i fear it too, since my digestion is better than it’s ever been.) does anyone have suggestions as to whether i should incorporate more food into my diet as the surgery date gets closer?"
1,Able900,356,"Carla, I definitely think you should change a few things prior to your surgery. Unfortunately, this will require putting aside your fight against the Candida somewhat, that is if you’re still doing the treatment at that time. But I would also advise you to start the treatment back a week or so after your surgery. I would add more protein for one thing; the best choices are still eggs, chicken and fish, but I would definitely have these everyday at least twice a day until your surgery. You could also add dried beans maybe once a day and even replace of one serving of chicken or fish with the beans occasionally. Stop taking your antifungal supplements, all herb products, and both vitamin A and vitamin E until a few weeks after the surgery. As far as vitamins are concerned, you could also make a few changes there. Vitamin C, take at last 3000 mg a day. Vitamin C can help your body heal much faster than without it as well as prevent nausea after the surgery. You should continue taking a high dose of probiotic between now and surgery and especially after surgery if you are given an antibiotic.  Which one are you taking at this time and how many doses a day? If you have individual vitamin D3 capsules, you should be taking these prior to surgery because of their ability to repair bone tissue. Zinc, calcium and magnesium are necessary as well. Zinc is of major importance for wound healing, regeneration and repair. I don’t have to tell you how important calcium is for bone health and repairing damaged bone. Magnesium is involved in approximately 300 biochemical reactions which can help you heal. You can also find amino acids in supplement form; two important ones to take before surgery are L-Arginine and L-Glutamine. These are for wound repair and healthy immune function. Good luck to you, Carla. Able"

0,rar,357,"ANOTHER JOURNAL! Another attempt at this candida diet. The longest I made it in the past was 6 days, most of the days I just water fasted because I saw no point in eating if it didn’t have enjoyment. But those 6 days were very extreme, the moved very slowly, sleep was almost impossible and when it did come it was full of nightmares, awake meant being bedbound and too weak to walk and sometimes just sit up, nauseau, cold sweats hot flashes, depression. I started to get the hang of it and I stopped resisting so much. Instead of waking up to the misery of knowing I had to get through one more day, I woke up and just accepted today would suck, that’s okay, I’m moving forward. That was a really good step. I still cut it off at day 6 but I now I know the point I have to get to is the point of acceptance so that I can move through the die off, and that the point comes at around day 6. It’s always scary to start again and know you’re throwing yourself into that again, and that you might not even make it through and may have to repeat this attempt a few times, but I’m ready to try again. This process is extremely difficult, no wonder there are so few people who have overcame candida through diet. Well I plan on expressing the difficulty, but I also want to practice positive thinking through this journal and give voice more dedication. The motivation is always that point of “I’ve had enough.”. The anxiety is getting worse these last few days to the point where I have to postpone going out to get groceries every day for a week until I can finally do it, I’ve failed at least 4 attempts to complete my grade 12 year highschool only because I’m too anxious to leave the house or I’m too fatigued to do the work. The depression is suddenly worsening too, I’ve just had enough."
1,wishnhope,357,"hey rar, If you find it so difficult to water fast, why not skip the cleanse part and start right on the strict diet?"
2,rar,357,"High wishnhope, thanks for the fast reply, don’t worry I don’t’ plan to water fast. That’s something that just seemed easier the last time I was doing the diet, just ended up happening. Sticking to the diet is the plan 🙂"
3,rar,357,"Okay so I started, end of the first day without sugar.It’s amazing what even 1 day without sugar ups and downs can do. My body already feels calmer. Already the bloating and gas is gone, the athlete’s foot, the weird fermenting kind of feeling that I get in my feet (ick horrible feeling), the head pressure. I’m able to connect to my emotions more already, more clear headed. That was fast. It feels good All I ate today was pork and brazil nuts? Not the most balanced day.I actually took in literally 0 sugars today, not even a wee bit from lettuce. Not something I plan to do the rest of the week obviously but I found it really weird to see on nutritiondata that my food added up to 0 on the glycemic index. Didn’t even know that was possible Already a bit of the old symptoms that occur when you quit sugar are coming up. The first one, insomnia. It is quite scary when you realize that you have been relying on sugar to fall asleep, or have a bowel movement (I get so horribly constipated if I don’t feed the candida, never heard of that before). Without sugar, my body forgets how to do these things, already. No weakness yet but expecting tomorrow that to start. One question, how do you guys go out to get groceries when the weakness starts? I eat a lot of fresh vegetables but if I can barely get out of bed for 2 weeks, I don’t see how that will happen."
4,rar,357,"end of day 2, not much to report. Have been very apathetic/depressed today. I’m sure a lot of that has to do with this diet/sugar withdrawal. I woke up with a yeast infection so I saw that as a good sign. Very surprised that I have not hit the die off state yet, usually day 2 is the most difficult? Ate a salad w/ sunflower seed dressing (soaked 12 hours, no worries) And now am eating some soaked hazelnuts and alfalfa sprouts. Oh, also I took bentonite clay in the morning. No appetite today. Hmm.. very depressed. Hang out with a friend but couldn’t manage the energy to smile, laugh, do anything really! This is usual for whenever I try this diet. That will be the hardest part for sure, but I can handle it"
5,immunetroubles,357,"rar Sorry to hear this is such a tough road for you! Especially since you’re so young. I’m wondering if you went too hard at the cleanse, and that resulted in massive die-off and weakness, such that you couldn’t really stay on it and get past that first difficult week. I think, and I’ve seen this recommended by the experts on this forum, that you could consider cutting out the cleanse, and going straight to the diet. Another idea would be for you to go and stock up at the grocery store before you begin the diet, maybe even prepare some really tasty forum recipies and have them available for you when you start. I feel that it’s better to start off slow and stay on the diet as much as you can, than to have to keep stoppping due to die off and weakness. If you fail at all (cheat on the diet), don’t give up, just keep going with it as best you can. Although I’ve had some food I shouldn’t have several times, I am still trying to stick with it as much as possible and I am improving. Best of luck, and I hope you’re feeling better soon!! Lynda"
6,rar,357,"Thanks immune. I’m going to take that advice and be less strict (Did not realize I was closer to the cleansing stage rather than the diet stage with what I have been doing).  I think I’ll start to include a lot of organic meats into the diet so that my body has something else to work on rather than cleansing. Shame I’m allergic to dairy and eggs though. I’ve tested including some of the grains in the okay list and I get a reaction to most of the ones I’ve tried so have just decided not to touch grains. I’m guessing the meat should be organic/antibiotic free? Also I found a home-delivery service at one of the stores I shop at. Perfect incase the weakness doesn’t let up (It is really strong every since I woke up today). Honestly I wanted to rush right into detox because I’m sick of being sick and just want it over with! Sometimes it’s great to be able to say “This is probably the worst of it” rather than fearing when the worst of it will be. But I definitely don’t want to start yo-yoing. How bizarre that right now things like soda, chocolate pancakes and other sucrose-dense foods seem like poison, but FRUIT seems absolutely godly. Fructose is so addictive"
7,rar,357,"This is now a candida transitioning journal. I did not feel stable with the decision to jump into the diet, especially because I was so weak today (I will say though that bentonite clay really seems to help with die off, I had the energy to get out of bed to get water and stuff which usually is not there when I feel weak). The weird thing is I already noticed positive effects even on just day 3, even while I was weak and flu-y. So that’s awesome and really shows it’s a good direction. I’m going to start by just eliminating grains (corn, rice) for probably about a week, then just eat fruit as a sugar source (dried or not)>just fresh fruit> and then I’ll remove all fruit and replace with buckwheat or something and then finally it will be onto the die off stage. It will take somewhere between 2-4 weeks, I just don’t want to push myself, I binge eat if I feel restricted."
8,rar,357,"K guys. Today was a collard wrap with tahini, broccoli and quinoa for breakfast and lunch. Then I had some homemade buckwheat crackers for a snack. I decided to start with basically a candida diet + the safe “grains” or seeds and will eliminate them in about 1-2 weeks."

Rar, Lucy has complete support from the seasoned veterans on the forum in what she’s told you. And pardon me, but starting your journey to a cure for your infestation by naming the journal “Accepting Pain” is an extremely negative approach, not to mention its possible effect on other new members. Using the title, “Accepting Pain” infers to me that you’ve already given up. Really would have preferred a different title, but that’s just me. Don’t you hate it when someone says, “Been there, done that”? Yeah, I used to as well, but on this forum, when it comes to factual information on how to cure your infestation, well, you simply can’t get any closer to that than listening to, “Been there, done that.” That’s because that statement means that someone has traveled the path before you, and the people who have traveled it know the tricky turns, the detours and the potential problems, and above all, they’ve learned how to reach your destination. Imagine you’re on a trip to some distant place to which you’ve never traveled before. You don’t have a map with you. Next to you in the passenger’s seat is a truck driver who has traveled to your destination many times during his career. Would you bother to listen to his directions and advice or would you turn to guess work to find your destination? Then why not use the same sensible logic in curing your infestation and listen to the people on the forum who have literally “been there, done that” before you? They’ve cut the path for you which means you’re not on an undiscovered path, Rar, you’re on a path that has already been mapped out for you if you’ll just use common sense and take advantage of it.

Four years back, I suffered from a severe infection of intestines and lungs for which I took some very strong antibiotics. After the treatment I had constipation quite frequently and I mistook it as another infection coming up in the body… So, I used to take antibiotics very frequently. This I did for around 1 year when I actually felt that I have done some serious damage to my body. But when i used to take antibiotics, my constipation used to get cure. This was my mistake! I regret it deeply. For constipation, I tried everything husk, lactulose, MgO, homeopathy etc etc… No relief yet – sometimes it is fine. Seen gastro doctors many a times but they say its IBS and they treat me for that. They say it is all in the mind. My all the tests are almost fine except for vitamin B12 which was depleted in the body. So took some shots to replenish it in the body. The days after the shots, I felt very well but now again the situation has worsen. the typical symptoms I have are: Itching after eating or drinking soda, coffee… Psoriasis on the fingers, which got better when I stick to this candida diet. lethargy, constipation, dandruff, inability to loose weight etc. I tried candida diet for few days but lost the focus after sometime. Now what I feel is after doing a detailed research on candida is that I got the overgrowth due to abuse of antibiotics. Can I get well and how? I am keen to do anything, i just want to get well asap and enjoy life. Please help… Thank you very much… Anuj"
1,Able900,359," Hello, and welcome to the forum. I don’t know for certain if you have Candida or not, you’re in a better position to know that then we are. But I can say that your description fits any of a number of different descriptions of a Candida albicans infestation. If Candida is indeed your problem, you won’t be able to cure it until you treat the entire infestation and not just a few symptoms. And if you decide you really want to go this route, you can’t go about it half hearted; anyone who does this is wasting their time and ours. However, if you can be dedicated to the treatment there’s a great chance that you can cure the infestation. If this is what you want to do, you can start by reading our protocol and then please come back with your questions. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx We’ll always be willing to talk with you and answer your questions as long as you’re sincere about your treatment.

2,carla mc,360,"thanks for the reply…sometimes i ‘fear’ posting.(almost like stage fright-not wanting to bug the experts with more of the same stuff…) here’s my regimen since early jan (december was full of mistakes like nuts,beans,rice& pumpkin soup) supplements: calcium 250mg 2x day molybdenum150 mcg 2xday vitamin c w/rosehips 1000mg 3xday vitamin d 25 mcg 3xday folic acid 1000 mcg once a day antifungals-varied every 10 days-caproil,oil of oregano,grapefruit seed extract, olive leaf extract.(i take the liquid form of these always.) drink-filtered water, organic nettle leaf tea,organic peppermint. i keep it down to two tea bags a day…i sip on tea all day, just add more water each time. a few years ago a gynecologist told me too much tea/coffee was the source of all my yeast woes…so i’m trying to moderate it. tolerated food- coconut bread (going thru the small recipe of it every 2 days) fried/scrambled eggs were part of my routine (6 a day) until 2 weeks ago, then my upper belly decided to hurt relentlessly for 3 hours after eating them. still disappointment about that…! at least i can still tolerate them in the coconut bread. greens veggies any variety. often stirfried. spinach/romaine salad at least once a day. avocados cause the same upper belly pain that eggs do, so i’m avoiding them now. lots of oils-mainly hi end coconut oil,olive oil,hemp& flax in my salads.(only about a tbsp each of hemp and flax a day)…my coconut oil consumption is up to 7 tbsp a day.maybe more. braggs-sometimes i fear i may use too much?? occasional pepper use. some apple cider vinegar too.(once a week) buckwheat probiotic(taken at night) 2-3 a day.500 mg…dds with fos. any suggestions would be welcome. thinking i might need to add more magnesium (ran out a few days ago) zinc or selenium. (all three?) wishing i could get diagnosed with something other than yeast…the only thing an upper gi scope told the dr was that there was slight redness & swelling (although that was over 2 1/2 months ago…thinking there’s been healing since then.) thankssss!"

4,carla mc,360,"no energizing tea, just herbal (nettle leaf & peppermint) it seems strange that oral & genital symptoms worsen now, after months on the diet. at the start there seemed to be lots of improvement! i keep wondering if it will get better at all if i still have my metal fillings. while they don’t hurt, my teeth feel kind of…electric? when i wake up.(covered in fuzzies, even a few hours after brushing)"

4,Able900,361,"Kris wrote: Please, let me know if you think this is something that sounds like it is systemic? Hello, Kris. I’ll tell you what systematic candidiasis really is, and you tell me if you really think there’s a chance you may have this. First, a person would have to have the Candida overgrowth for a fairly long period of time and probably not have a clue as far as how to treat it before contracting S.C. Systemic candidiasis can spread through the body in the bloodstream. Eventually, it targets the vital organs which include the brain and involves the central nervous system. Brain abscesses and infarctions can occur as well with systemic candidiasis. Other results of S.C. are endocarditis which involve fever, heart murmurs, heart palpitations, enlarged spleen and even congestive heart failure. Other symptoms of this ‘deadly’ situation are nephritis such reduced urine output, bloody urine, and edema of the hands and feet, as well as inflammation of the kidneys. And there’s no way that S.C. would spare the intestines; these symptom include almost continuous and severe abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting and diarrhea. Additional symptoms include inflammation of the vitreous humor of the eye and septic shock. In virtually all cases, a person who reaches this level is going to be admitted to a hospital early on in the illness. A report from the Merck Manuals Online Medical Library states, “All forms of disseminated candidiasis should be considered serious, progressive, and potentially fatal.” Able"
5,immunetroubles,361,"Kris, I recently went to an MD in Boston regarding my candida and I referred to it as “systemic”. He explained that systemic meant it was in your organs, and when that occured it was deadly. He said my case wasn’t “systemic” but it was subcutanous, candida infection of the mucosa (or mucosal tissues). Since Mucosal tissues are throughout the body, I assumed the infection would be called systemic, but it isn’t. Mucosal tissues include vaginal, nasal, sinus, and intestinal tissues. Sounds like you have infection of the mucosa as I do. Bottom line: whatever you call it, it makes you feel soooo sick in every part of the body and like you’re being poisoned. Take heart, follow the diet and protocol, and I think you’ll be feeling better soon. All the best, Lynda"

4,carla mc,362,"i had been using oil of oregano.things stayed the same (felt like steady lessening of symptoms) during the 10 days on olive leaf extract(liquid). since trying the GSE (2 weeks) and the new garlic powder, tongue is feeling thicker, pastier. burning mouth again too.a new thing-the teeth with amalgam feel extra coated no matter how much brushing(with neem&tea tree oil)& flossing. i don’t think it’s ever felt this bad orally, but still feeling good about the improvements in digestion.maybe it’s just the yeast battling with the chemistry, one last (hopefully) hurrah with my body before i starve it out? i’ve been in the habit of taking anti fungals with meals…might this make a difference? it’s fascinating to realize how the yeast is affecting the anxiety-or is it the other way around? incredible that the more yeasty/stressy i get, the more of a lady beard i get!

5,Javizy,362,"carla mc wrote: it’s fascinating to realize how the yeast is affecting the anxiety-or is it the other way around? incredible that the more yeasty/stressy i get, the more of a lady beard i get! It’s a two-way process. Your psychological state can influence your biochemistry and vice-versa. It’s hard to control your biochemistry while you’re not optimally absorbing nutrients and experiencing die-off, but you can at least try to exercise some control over stress. Stress will cause you much bigger problems than any spice, and you can probably assume you won’t cure your problem until you deal with it."
6,carla mc,362,agreed. the anti candida diet has become much more than just ‘changing my diet for a while’…and become a whole life overhaul! 🙂 thanks.
0,dtheorem,363,"Hello, I am very certain that I have a severe case of candida overgrowth. It started about two and a half months ago, when I developed a rash on my face which spread and cause my face to swell up, making me look like a boxer. I immediately went on a juice fast lasting about a week and a half, and it cleared up my face somewhat (although my arms, legs, hands, neck, and ears all broke out with severe eczema). I then went to see a “skin specialist” who told me to take some prednizone, so, much to my shame, I did. It cleared up my skin issues and all was well for the Chrismas holidays. However, slowly over the course of the next week, the rash began to develop again, so I went on another juice fast (Granny smith apples) for about 10 days, which cleared everything up again. When I started eating once again after that, it took only a few days before my face started to tingle whenever I ate something. So, as to avoid not missing any more days of work, I went on a four day fast, which cleared everything up. After that, I figured out that I must have a candida issue and began the diet three weeks ago. I have been having some trouble, though, because it seems like all I can eat is salad and eggs. Everytime I try something new, my face begans to burn. I’m talking about things like spaghetti squash, the coconut bread, tahini, and anything else I try from the recipe sections. It is troubling to me. This past week I have been getting a permanent burning sensation on my face that is not going away, even though I have been eating “Candida Diet” for three weeks now. I just finished a salad for supper, which caused my face to increase it’s burning almost immediately after I finished. I realize that something is not right. My main question is this: could this be candida die-off? Or does this sound like more of a “yeast is still advancing” problem. I’m quite distressed because if I can’t even eat a salad without my face burning, then what can I eat? I should mention one thing that I’m a bit concerned over, and maybe this is the cause of all these extra issues I’m having. I’ve been taking coconut oil for the last few weeks as an anti-fungal, and discovered that I really like the taste and texture of it. This was all before I read about slowly increasing your dosage of coconut oil, and I started off by taking the equivalent of about 18-20 teaspoons of the stuff everyday. It was only later that I learned about die-off destroying your liver and other organs. I’m worried I’ve done some irreparable harm to my liver from the massive amounts of anti-fungal that I used. Has anyone had this experience before? Is it normal for die-off related symptoms to appear as soon as you eat anything? Should I go on another fast to clear everything up and start over again? Thank-you"

It’s really impossible to say for certain without more information about your specific situation.

This would certainly explain the severe die-off symptoms.It was only later that I learned about die-off destroying your liver and other organs. Have you now read enough to be aware of Molybdenum and the role it plays in die-off? Has anyone had this experience before? A lot of people have to one degree or another; some to the point of passing out.Is it normal for die-off related symptoms to appear as soon as you eat anything?Just about anything is possible with a Candida infestation, so maybe it isn’t normal, but that doesn’t mean it can’t happen.Should I go on another fast to clear everything up and start over again?A fast won’t help if it’s die-off. Remaining on the diet but removing any antifungal until you’ve been on Molybdenum for three days would be a good thing to do.

0,Codyssey,364,"Okay so here’s a rough breakdown of my story. Have had chronic athletes foot for over 2 years. Got a bit of chlamydia from an evil ex girlfriend, treated that with cipro last march. Retained lesions around the base of the head of my penis, which I thought were related to the chlamydia. Sat for a few months with that. Finally had a full blown epidytimis attack. Had to go to the urologist because of the pain. Was prescribed a full course of cipro and to no avail my symptoms seemed to spread. The epidytimis proper went away thankfully but I had more pain in my abdomen. The urologist a month later diagnosed me with prostatitis. Proceeded to give me an uncomfortable prostate massage to check for a certain fluid to confirm. He got some fluid but the tone in his voice led me to believe it wasn’t exactly what he was looking for. Another full course of cipro was given and my symptoms again only exacerbated. Especially noticeable to me was a swelling of my lymph node in my neck and a pressure on the left side of my face. Mainly my eye. It took a little research when I happened upon Candidiasis. Eureka ive found it! Today I visit my GP. Unfortunately my urologist was on Easter vacation from all of last week to almost all of this week. Fuckin doctors right? So I visit my GP expecting some sympathy or maybe even a eureka moment for her. I even showed off my fabulous penile thrush.  But no. She said people with systemic yeast must be hospitalized. The symptoms are too severe to cope with. Trust me I’ve seen it working ten years in the field as well as in hospitals. She said only those with immune deficiencys tend to have it. We need to check you for HIV. Okay! Even though I had one here last year and it came back negative? Even though I haven’t been with anyone since I started feeling this way? Well if you say so doc. Furthermore when I started explaining my symptoms and their connection to candida overgrowth she replied: Stop reading so much! To say the least I am very very disenfranchised on western medicine. And with doctors in general. I started my cleanse last Friday and am powering through until the bitter end of this illness. It makes me think that there need to be specialists spreading the word to all branches of medicine. And almost; almost inspires me to become one of them. Thank you for your time Cody"
1,carrotflowers,364,"Hey Cody! I hear ya, I was really achey/tired/sick with flu symptoms, after having been on several courses of antibiotics, and my doctor looked at my mouth (tongue covered in thrush) and said “well, it looks like some kind of infection.” and didn’t prescribe me anything except to drink a lot of water. When i mentioned candida, he scoffed. I am hopeful that it is becoming more and more well known because so many natural/holistic practitioners are working hard to get the word out. Good luck with your recovery!!! xx"
2,Codyssey,364,Thanks for the reply! I’m on day six of my cleanse and had my third BM only the discover some little nasties living in me. Worms to be exact. Supposedly they can be a part of this illness. Either way I’m more than happy to purge them! Only thing I want in me is me. It’s kind of a shame that on my sixth day I can finally drink my detox drinks without wanting to yak right away lol
3,MrMusic009,364,"I hear ya Codyssey, I have had candida I believe since I was 12 years old. I have metal fillings, have had antibiotics since I was young, and ate a lot of sugar – I’m sure they all contributed. It took me until this past year (I’m 29 now) to find this illness, and my symptoms (which range from skin problems like jock itch and general itchiness to foggy head and bruxism or grinding teeth) have never been so under control since I started the diet. I saw doctors about this for over 10 years and they would either throw prescriptions at me or tell me there was nothing wrong. The last doctor I saw told me I was a hypochondriac when I told him I had been researching on my own and wanted to know about Candida. Why are they so quick to turn so many people away when the find relief with this diet / natural healing? Perhaps they are just ignorant, I really hope there’s no conspiracy behind this, I guess there’s just not enough studies being done on Candida, which I am 100% behind if I hear of anyone who needs help getting them done. In the end, I think the summary is that the most common symptom of Candida is one that Western scientific doctor’s cannot see."
4,SamanthaB,364,"I totally agree and it must be even worse for a guy given how many of the symptoms are more prevalent in women or more well known at least. Even so, I have seen several doctors over the last 3 years explaining things like permanent constipation and even showing my stomach full on bloated – it looks like I am 6 months preggers and the response was…it looks like your body shape has just changed and that’s something you just need to get used to! I even questioned it, “Really? Overnight my shape can change from flat stomach to permanently this size?” Apparently it’s “normal” – what a load of rubbish!!!"
5,Lily,364,"Wow so many similar symptoms! I have a sore tongue which my dentist first noticed 6 months ago as it had red patches on which makes it feel like my tongue has been burned. It has a white plaque on the end each morning which can be wiped off. I have tried topical creams, my doc has given me nystatin which worked a bit but don’t think the course of treatment was long enough, now I’m on another anti-fungal treatment for 2 weeks. I suffer with headaches, stomach pains, bruxism, I seem to get confused really easily and so forgetful! I’ve had ridiculous amounts of antibiotics over the years. I was diagnosed with IBS at 21, I’m now 39. I have suffered with vaginal thrush on and off for years but now seem to have oral thrush too. Basically I just never feel ‘well’. I tried the spit test and lo and behold my spit had legs! I must admit to often eating too many sugary foods and I do like my wine so have decided I really need to do this detox I’ve been reading about. I’m trying to introduce a yeast free diet gradually so that in a couple of weeks when i start the detox it wont be so much of a shock to me. I’m cutting down on caffeine already and wine and the sugary foods. Drinking lots of water and herbal tea. Also having at least one meal a day that is free of the evil yeast. Eventually I will work up to cutting it out altogether."
6,LolloRosso,364,I got told by my practice nurse when I told her I’d been reading about my symptoms that ‘who on earth has written these books and what do they know’??!!! The Health ‘Professionals’ want to keep us ignorant. It makes me very cross to see how many people are being turned away because of blatant neglect and ignorance.
7,candida_sucks,364,"Perhaps the drug companies make so much money off of doctors only treating the symptoms of candidiasis that they wish the root cause to go undiagnosed? That would be sinister, but I wouldn’t put it past them. It wouldn’t shock me to learn if the drug companies somehow had influence over the curriculum taught in medical schools, and were paying researchers to bias western medicine into thinking that candidiasis is rare. Candidiasis had tortured me for years, and my regular doctor was never able to figure out the root cause. Only when a more holistic type of doctor recently diagnosed me did I start to learn about all of this and make some progress."

Thank you for your time Cody Your case looks very similar to my. I had a sequence of events almost identical to you. My, even was worse, two Urologists were treating me and prescribing more and more antibiotics in spite of the famous prostatitis never showed bacterial positive in any test. At the end, I took antibiotics for 2 months, including 1 month on Levaquin (more stronger than Cipro) Those antibiotics destroyed my healthy intestinal tract, one that worked perfect until I was 43. Today, I am still battling the severe intestinal fungal overgrowth those antibiotics caused. Fortunately, thanks my own diligence and research, I could end with the UT infection, balanitis, and prostatitis. I took Itracanozole and Lamisil together for 3 continue months to clear it. I wish you luck and you already know what worked for me. Jorge."

This isn’t very far from the truth. Drug companies have a massive influence over medical institutions and research journals, since they provide eye-watering sums in ways of grants, funding and advertising revenue. It’s no coincidence that modern physicians know next to nothing about biochemistry, yet practically make pharmacists redundant with their knowledge of pharmaceuticals. There just isn’t enough money in natural healing methods (not that pharmaceuticals are a healing method of any kind), so we’re pretty much stuck with the current paradigm until everyone realises why they’re so unhealthy."

Thanks, Able I wish he have found the cure, but I would like to know what diabolic thought govern your mind ?? Do you really think a diet and coconut oil, GSE, etc can cure an fungal UT infection ?? A fungal infection in the UT is something that need urgent medical treatment with drugs. It is clear you have not suffered it and are delaying people the right treatment and prolonging their suffering. What direct impact can have a diet on a fungal infection in your UT ??? Fungal infections are the fourth cause of UT infections in general hospitals in US. People get proper treatment and eradicate it. They need systemic Rx drugs. People with AIDS and severely immune suppressed acquire it and are treated successfully with medical drugs. Only in your sick mind is possible to think that a diet and some natural supplements will cure a candidiasis in your UT. It looks like you don’t have any idea what is a systemic drug and why it is used ?? I have seen people living testimonies about how they reached a cure in every forum. What I have never seen is someone cured, as you claim yourself, posting and posting in any forum in the obsessive way you do. If you were cured, you weren’t here. Nobody really cured of this nightmare keep writing in forums. Leaving your testimony is more than enough. You may have cured you intestinal candidiasis, but that one you have in your brain is far to be cured. Respect people, suggest a protocol, but you don’t respect the right they have to chose what they want freely."

0,robin,365,"Hi, My name is Robin. I am a 25 year old girl from The Netherlands. Since I was 16 I was sick. I was diagnosed with IBS and told it was all in my head. For years I tried everything to get rid of it. From drugs to really weird stuff like rocking my bowels like a baby in my mind. I tried everything to get better. I had people talking to my bowels under hypnosis while pretending I was a bowel. Weird stuff. I didn’t care just wanted to get better. I moved to Barcelona, Spain for school (because of my health I had dropped out of so many universities and wanted to make a clean start). The school I was going to was really tough work. No social life whatsoever. Just studying. Because they said it was all in my head and therapy didnt work, I tried for years, I hired a personal trainer to get me fit. I decided it was all in my head and I should just get over myself. My trainer really pushed me. After a work out I would be sick. I would have a high fever, muscle ache like you never had one before, and throwing up all the time. Then I saw a doctor who diagnosed me with ME and fybromialgia. He said I had a long way to go, but I was so thrilled I finally got a diagnoses. After I gave into being sick, not pushing myself anymore, but taking some time off, I noticed that I was always having a fever. I saw this alternative doctor and she diagnosed me with all sorts of deficiencies and a really high count of Candida overgrowth. I moved back to the Netherlands and saw some doctors specialised in ME and fybromialgia, and they all gave me the same diagnoses but nothing they could do about it. I spent a couple of months on the couch and in bed. Then I read some stuff online like ‘the yeast connection’ and ‘tired so tired’ and I tried the diet. I got better after a couple of months. And I got of the diet. Now I am as sick as I was before. Walking is really hard, everything hurts and I am in bed all day. I thought getting better always ment that I would be better after a while. But when I eat carbs the trouble start again, not immediately, but it builts up. So now I have to start again. If I do a really severe detox I always get really sick, I tried for the past couple of days, but I have been crying in my bed with pain, so I am gonna take it easy on myself. I am looking forward to get better, and maybe, since I got of the diet too soon I will feel like a normal person one day, No idea how awesome that must be. Good luck to everybody. I know it’s hard but I also know it works. And, another great thing, on my long search for cures I found out so much stuff about healthy food, and the candida diet isnt just for people who suffer from candida, it’s really healthy for everybody."

If you’ll start taking a mineral called Molybdenum three days before beginning the detox, you won’t feel nearly as sick and should be able to get through it with few if any problems. If you don’t know about this mineral or want more information, just ask. Able"
2,robin,365,"Hi Able, When I got off the diet I started eating the way all Dutch people do. Bread for breakfast and lunch, potatoes during dinner. A lot of fruit and a lot of bread. I don’t eat pasta though because that makes me sick instantly. But we also tend to put chocolate sprinkles on our sandwiches and chocolate spread. Real good stuff 🙂 I was taking molybdenum, but I get a fever, an awful headache, so cold that I have to wear two pairs of pants and turn the heating up until it gets really warm and a lot of pain in my bowels. I am also really nauseas all the time. But I have experienced it’s worse when I only take liquids, if I eat vegetables it’s better, but still horrible. Tomorrow I will start with the cleanse in which I can eat the vegetables. Maybe I can do the more kind one and after I got a bit better go to a more profound cleanse to get rid of everything. Sorry for my english 🙂 I was wondering how much molybdenum you would advice on taking? The package I ordered from the UK says only one tablet a day… Tnx!"

And, another great thing, on my long search for cures I found out so much stuff about healthy food, and the candida diet isnt just for people who suffer from candida, it’s really healthy for everybody. Hi Robin, One of the most difficult part with this infection is to know the right time to release the diet. It is very difficult to know when there aren’t more fungal candida colonies in the gut able to regrowth and when to know that the immune system and the competitive flora be able to hold candida in its unicellular form. Both books you read are very informative, but my experience says me that Dr. Crook didn’t have a well elaborated diet, still allowing food that feed the fungus. Another thing is to reverse the immune tolerance it is necessary enough time to allow the immune system re-activates against yeast again. It took time to the overgrowth to suppress the immune system. Then, it will take time to recover it again. I advice you to keep away of those books diet, instead to follow a more restrictive diet such as this one in this forum. When you be asymptomatic again, I wish it be soon, don’t return to food that feed the fungus for long time. I also think you should continue the antifungals for long enough after the symptoms have disappeared. I have relapsed two times after being asymptomatic for 2 or 3 months because I discontinued the diet. Now, I am working in more areas such as detoxification, chelation, and flora recovering with fecal transplants to see if some day I can release the diet and don’t experiment any relapse. The good thing is this time I am not hurried so I don’t care if this will take 2 or 3 years. Jorge."

Yeah, I know that now, because I experienced exactly this, but that is fine with me as well, because I would rather feel healthy than sick.I assume this happens only during a detox period, or not? Yes, but now my illness has really come to this point of no way out. I am too sick not to go on a diet or detox, but when I do a detox I get so sick I cannot do anything but stay in bed and suffer… So, I kinda felt what you were sayingIn fact, in your present condition, I would advise against any type of detox period. So I also thought I should just go on a diet, or even ease into it. But I am kind of confused why I cannot take chicken or meat if I want to get rid of the candida. I only eat organic meat so there won’t be any anti-biotics in it. (I don’t eat chicken because here in the Netherlands the organic chicken has antibiotics in it as well even though they don’t give them anti-biotics)What is the amount of mcg’s on the label for each pill? It’s 400 mcgCan you tolerate eggs? Yes, I can have eggs, no problem. As for vegetables, I can get most of them listed on the website, but I don’t so well on cabbage or peas. However, to buy it organic is less easy. the goldenseal root and the swedish bitters and black walnut contain all over 40% alcohol, is that ok, because if alcohol (sugars) feed candida it’s not so smart right?

I know now I should stay on the diet longer, or even forever. That’s fine. But the hard thing is getting started because it will make me feel even worse than I already do. Guess I just have to suck it up. But it gets so hard that I cannot do anything but stay in bed all day."
7,Lauren,365,"Robin,  I am sorry about the pain you are in. Have you thought of a possible parasite problem along with Candida? I just relate a lot to your post and for me personally the problem is not just Candida. I also have read somewhere that there is evidence that a certain parasite causes Fibromyalgia symptoms, if I remember correctly. I believe it was on a doctor website that everyone highly recommends but now I cant find it. lol So I don’t know how accurate my memory is. Here is a link to this doctors book that has something about fibromyalgia and how it might be an underline infection or infestation.  https://www.drbrownstein.com/bookstore_OvercomingA.php Also, I have been told it is all in your head and also tried to push through it. My dad grew up on a farm and I was always taught that pain is just a part of life and with will power you could solve anything. But this is not the case in many situation. If will power along could fix me, I think I would be fixed already. Instead things just slowly got worse and worse. Though I am thankful I learned this from my dad because will power sure helps keeping you going 😀  Hope you feel better soon and I hope this info helps, Lauren"

The aldehydes excreted by the dying Candida are toxins which can cause liver damage at their worst, and die-off symptoms are the physical reaction that you experience. You need to be taking something to protect both your liver and kidneys from Candida toxins. Molybdenum is an essential mineral which will continually remove the toxins from the liver. If I couldn’t afford Molybdenum, I’d drop one of the antifungals before I’d be without it."

You can take the 150 mcg dose up to six times a day spread out over a 24 hour period, not all at one time. You can also take 300 mcg at one time if you need to.

You can start slowly with a small amount and actually work up to as many as 14 to 15 teaspoons a day of this oil. Of course you can cook with it as well as often as you wish. You don’t need to refrigerate this oil, it hardens very easily.Tomorrow i will bake the famous coconut bread from this site…can i also add some shredded coconut to it?Yes by all means, add a bit of raw Stevia or Truvia if you want, sounds great to me. When you look for Stevia or Truvia be sure to look at the ingredients. Only inulin or FOS should be added to the Stevia.

0,immunetroubles,370,"Well, my story is somewhat of a long one, and a little different than most, although the same in many ways too. My family traveled to Mexico in 2005 and we all contracted cryptosporidium (an intestinal parasite). My son was 10 and had major complications and just could not kick it. I also had trouble getting rid of it, and actually still have it, although it’s reduced in its effect. We have since discovered that my entire family suffers from a genetic immune disorder (that we didn’t know about) that makes it very tough to fight disease. About a year ago, after many years of issues related to the parasite, I developed some other new major problems. I had a sharp tingling and sharp shooting pains and pressure in my neck back and shoulders. I had a huge lump in my throat and couldn’t swallow, along with stuff oozing out of my chin, and white pimples all over my chin (I never have those). I felt very fatigued, and had thrush on my tongue that burned. My immunologist diagnosed esophageal candida and put me on a high does of dilflucan 200mg daily (with my immune condition even the 200 didn’t work and I had to increase to 400 and even 600 on some days). I took the diflucan for over a year. I now have a yeast sinus infection and am taking ketoconazole in a spray form (it was amazingly effective). I was not advised to, and didn’t really alter my diet much, although I developed severe intolerance for most foods (they would bring back the shooting pains in my neck and shoulders). I cut out refined sugar, but not sweetener, and it didn’t really get better. I recently visited a holistic center in Boston that combines traditional and holistic medicine and I just started the Candida diet on Monday. I’m already feeling better. I know I have a long way to go, and this diet is a killer, don’t know how I can do it and not cheat. I didn’t do a cleanse, does that make a real difference? With my situation, (being that the continual reinfection with the parasite causes ongoing reinfection with the yeast) I think a more steady path for me is best, rather than radical measures to kill it all off at once. I’m taking pharmacuetical antifungals but no natural ones at this point. I’m taking (50 billion) probiotic daily. Am I on the right path?"

Reply: It’s good to remove as many toxins as possible from the body right from the beginning, but lots of people choose not to do this. You can still cure your infestation, the detox period normally just hastens the response time.  With my situation, (being that the continual reinfection with the parasite causes ongoing reinfection with the yeast) I think a more steady path for me is best, rather than radical measures to kill it all off at once. Reply: Well you can’t kill it off with the diet anyway. And the process has to be taken slowly to prevent an overload of toxins for the liver and other organs which often happens anyway. Quote: I’m taking pharmacuetical antifungals but no natural ones at this point. I’m taking (50 billion) probiotic daily. Am I on the right path? Reply: I don’t know. A few questions answered might help; Which probiotic are you taking? (brand name) Which diet are you on, the one on the forum or the one on the site? Just for your information, the natural antifungals work just as well as the doctor prescribed ones do, and in many cases, better. One of the very best is organic virgin coconut oil. It not only kills the Candida with its fatty acids, but it’s also a whole food which will benefit you in many other ways.

I read the information about the studies showing the natural anti-fungals being as powerful as the drugs, and I’ll be ordering some of the oil or oregano and also coconut oil, and switching to natural remedies as soon as I get them. I guess I’m on the diet on the candida diet website, I haven’t eaten anthing forbidden for almost one week. I got guidelines from a nutritionist who is treating me. She said I was the worse case she ever saw. One of my dietary questions is that I was told i can have hummus but I’m not sure about that, there’s some conflicting info. thanks again Lynda"
3,Able900,370," Lynda, the experts on the forum probably can’t help you much unless you’re following the same diet that they did, or in some cases, still are. I posted it earlier, but here it is again. http://www.thecandidadie…ALLOWED-FOODS-LIST.aspx I would leave hummus alone for at least a month or longer as there are plenty of other foods to choose from the allowed foods list posted above. Able"
4,immunetroubles,370,"The link you posted is the diet I’ve been following. I’ll lay off the hummus for now, hoping to be able to have it when I’m further along. thanks again!"
5,sallyf024,370,"Lynda, You can do this!  Able was a major part in my recovery and the best adviser I found after nearly a year’s research. The diet was difficult to begin with but after 6 months of it, I have adopted it for life! I no longer get cravings for all the crap that I ate before.  You may want to add ‘oil swishing’ to your recovery process. Able introduced this to me and it was very successful for oral thrush and esophageal candida. Through the process of diet, antifungals and probiotics, my lifetime problems with arthritis and sinus infections literally disappeared. I had no idea that they were related to candida. Good luck!"
6,immunetroubles,370,"Thanks for the encouragement Sally!!! I so appreciate it. I know I can do it, but I’m still learning about the protocol, and it’s a lot at first. I’m excited that there is a way to get this under control without these drugs I’m taking. I also have sinus infections, that are yeast related. It’s amazing that you cleared up sinusitis and arthritis with this diet! Such a shame that most Docs don’t understand/recognize this as the scourge it is."

I had no idea that they were related to candida. Great to hear you achieved this kind of relief. I have similar symptoms myself. I was wondering if you eat nightshades now (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, chilli etc). I’ve heard a lot about nightshades being linked to arthritis, but I was thinking it could just be a developed sensitivity as a result of poor digestion. The testimonials I’ve read involve people simply avoiding nightshades rather than healing their digestive system, just like people with “gluten allergies” who avoid wheat and gluten and eat sugar-filled, gut-busting rubbish from the “free from” section instead. To me, the sensitivities seem to be a symptom of a wider problem. I’m going to avoid nightshades for a few months to see, but I’d really like to eat pasta sauce and curry again some day!"
8,sallyf024,370,"Javizy I am eating tomatoes now, but did not for quite sometime. However, I have learned that we are all different with our symptoms and reactions, which make this complicated. As I reintroduced foods, I had to notice any reactions. I did this slowly. I am still “keeping my fingers crossed”! Like I said, this is my diet of a lifetime, I NEVER want to get that sick again! Blessings and best of luck."
9,RennyP,370,"Hi Immunetroubles, I too have immune problems, I suffer with Crohn’s disease and Type 1 Diabetes and, in the past have had a skin condition called ‘Lichen Planus’. This is also cause by my immune system going into overdrive. As a result of the Diabetes (too much sugar in my blood) and Crohn’s, I have developed Candida more than once and had been treated with the anti-fungal drugs. These drugs are ok but can have nasty side effects such as; hives, itching, or swelling, breathing or swallowing problems, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, etc. As I have a tendency to develop Candida due to my illnesses and the medication I have to take for them, I decided to try a more natural way to treat the Candida.  I didn’t want to go on the Candida diet because it is extremely difficult to stick to it as, you really need to cut out all carbohydrates for it to work and, this for me is virtually impossible! Instead I tried a product you may have heard of called ‘Threelac’, I found this to be very effective at treating Candida and when you are taking it, you DON’T have to follow the strict diet, you just need to be sensible and stay away from sugar. It looks to me from reading your post that you may be using it as you mention Probiotics, that is good and I, from my own experiences, would suggest that is the best route to take when treating this horrible illness. There are many other Probiotic treatments for candida and it is certainly worth looking into trying these. I wish you every success in beating this disease All the best, Renny"

ThreeLac may work for a short period, but that’s all as it’s one of the weakest probiotics on the market. ThreeLac contains only three bacteria strains whereas there are 14 strains in the better probiotics. The count is a very meager 1.5 billion CFUs while others contain up to 200 billion and more. There’s simply no way this could make a lasting difference in a Candida infestation. The only thing that makes ThreeLac different from any other weak probiotic is the hype on the product. As far as not having to follow the diet but just staying away from sugar is concerned; that’s the whole principle of the diet. Do you have any idea how many forms of sugar there are and how many foods break down into sugar chains once they’re in the body? Able"

0,Dryad,371,"What follows is my account battling candida or what I thought was candida. It turns out that candida is only part of the story. The other part is my allergy to candida. During the winter of 2011 when I was working a very stressful job and eating large amounts of sugar that I believe set the stage for developing perhaps developed a sensitivity to yeast. Perhaps it was a yeast over growth which got a foothold due to a confluence of nasal steroid I was taking for seasonal allergies, a very high sugar diet, and combined with the most stress I’ve ever had in my life. In the spring of 2011 I began to get small eruptions of redness on my face. At first the blemishes were just below my right eye and but it eventually spread to both eyes and between the eyes above the nose. At times the edge of my eyes were bright red, raw, irritated and weeping slightly all the time. My allergies seem to get worse with nose dripping more often. I’ve always had bad seasonal allergies. Now I seem to have allergies even during the usual low allergy months. Log start: 5-1-2011 Noticed eye blotch, sinuses minimally involved. 6-1-2011 Eye blotch spreading. Start applying topical miconazole which seems to help. I dismiss as some minor yeasty beasty skin infection sure to be fixed by topical antifungal. 6-15-11 Woke up in the morning and went to kitchen to drink my usual eight ounces of room temperature tap water. As the water hits my stomach I double over in pain. Feels like a bomb went off in my stomach. Pain was so acute I nearly dropped the glass I was holding. Leave to get pepto from the store. Rest of the day the stomach was fine and was careful drinking water after. Pain appeared only that one day. I dismiss it as transient. 6-26-211 While visiting a friend I discussed having stomach pain and my friend suggests that it is an ulcer resulting from my stress levels. I mull it over and wonder if the nasal steroid I’ve been taking could be a factor as I had just recently quit that horribly stressful job. Perhaps it is an ulcer, will need to research more. Stopped all anti-inflammatory steroid use. 7-1-11 Full blown eye eruption and sinus involvement. Stop eating carbohydrates, no steroids. 8-1-11 Maintain dieting, skin is doing better but still some persistent redness and periodic allergy issues. 9-1-11 Ate carbs on vacation, eyes getting bad again. Back to zero carb diet again to get it under control. 9-15-11 Begin taking Nystatin orally, strict zero carb, begin first nasal irrigation with saline. I recommend NeilMedn nasal rinse bottle. It’s a great design. I just pour in a little table salt to it and fill with warm water. It has been so easy to use.  10-1-11 Fair bit of irritation, eyes red. Nasal passages seem persistently stuffed up and with constant but minor nasal drip. 10-20-11 Been strict with diet and taking Nystatin orally with rare nasal irrigation of saline with Nystatin solution. Symptoms 96% gone. Breathing so much better. Feeling like winning this finally. 10-21-11 Fell off wagon and eat carbs. Nasal flare up pretty much immediate. Blotchy skin returned over night. 12-10-12 While reading about candida I began to wonder if there wasn’t a sinus colony. As I figure it colony could have started in sinus, then fed by stress and sugar moved into gut and been an aggravating factor in the ulcer. With diet the gut improved but the initial colony could still be in the sinus evading treatment. After hours of reading I have come to the conclusion that condition may be Allergic Fungal Sinusitis rather than intestinal as I had presumed. 12-11-12 Devising plan to treat AFS based on the research I’ve seen. Choose not to use systemic antifungal agents owning to their low effect on superficial sinus tissue. It seems AFS can be non-invasive and existing on the surface of the mucosa only, living off the self reinforcing inflammatory products. The role of mast cells is identified and it becomes clear to me that a mast cell inhibitor and steroid are necessary ingredient. 12-16-12 Created nasal solution consisting of mometasone (Flonase) added to Cromolyn / Nystatin / miconazole solution. Nasal spray started to alleviate allergy eruption within 30 minutes of dosing. Also took Allegra and psuedophed. 12-17-12 Prepare Diflucan mixture. Mixture consists of fluconazole, mometasone, Cromolyn sodium and Nystatin. Calling it “Formula X”. 1-7-12 Saline rinse x2, start Formula X in late afternoon. Evening yes itchy, nose dripping – wondering if I’m developing allergy to cats. Took one Allegra, 30mg psuedophed and went to bed. 1-8-12  Woke with puffy eyes and one tiny red spot below right eye. Nose no longer drippy. Saline rinse and “Formual X” in AM. During day ate carbs but only in moderation. 1-9-12 Skin redness between eyes diminished. Eyes a little less puffy. Red spot below right eye is gone. Noon: sinuses and nasal passages feel open, no itchy nose or nasal drip. Haven’t felt sinuses this good in a while. 1-10-12 Have been eating normally for a month. No flare up of rhinitis. No asthma. No allergies. Daily routine is saline nasal irrigation BID and new diflucan nasal spray administered BID following saline. I feel absolutely normal again. Still being careful not to over due carbs. Have integrated fruit back into diet. 1-19-12 About a week ago I noticed my hair thinning thinning on my head. Could it be arterial-sclerosis resultant from the rather large intake of coconut oil? Begin using minoxidil on scalp. Hair loss is noticeable (to me at least). 1-23-12 I start to wonder if hair loss is secondary to use of Fluconazole. Quick web search yields many results Fluconazole associated hair loss. Have not taken spray today and will cease taking it. Switching to Cromolyn / Nystatin/ Mometasone solution only. Have already order Androcur and minoxidil oral to help offset hair loss, no idea if that will be at all effective. Losing hair right now is not an option. Suffice to say the the nasal cocktail seems 100% effective in bringing AFS under control. Will experiment as needed with periodic maintenance doses of fluconazole while using regular treatment with saline rinse and Cromolyn/Nystatin/mometasone spray. Usual treatment for AFS is to open up the sinus passages surgically. Because I have no insurance I have to treat based on what I am able to devise. There at least one polyp in the right sinus as I perceive based on air flow and a slight perception there may be something there. Prior to using Formula X that right sinus was persistently closed. For over a month it has been open but I can tell it could be better. I suspect that ultimately I’ll have to have the sinuses opened up as crucial step to long term management. If your eyes, nose, sinuses have been persistently involved I suggest you to see an ENT and discuss Allergic Fungal Sinusitis. Over the counter Cromolyn sodium (Nasal crom) and twice daily sinus rinses are something you can start right away."
1,Able900,371," It’s interesting that throughout your log from 5-1-2011 to 1-23-12, you only spoke of continually killing off portions of the infestation allowing the Candida albicans to repopulate and never once mentioned addressing the cause. Able"

But, of course, I wasn’t thinking or paying attention when I got strep throat after the new year. My Dr. prescribed penicillin and I didn’t think twice. Well after taking the meds for 10 straight days the strep was gone, but now I’m sick again feeling like I have the flu. Upon further reading, I found out that i just gave all the yeast in my body steroids…ughhhh kicking myself right now, but really excited about seeing this diet through and paying lots more attention."

0,jennyska,373,"Hi everyone,  I feel extremely alone and like no one understands. I was “diagnosed” with candida 3 months ago and since then it was hell. I was used to seeing my friends every day , ordering pizza, drinking, laughing, having coffees or popcorn in cinema and then it started. Sometimes I ask myself why is this happening to me, because to be honest, candida took over my life completely. So I tried starting to go on the diet when the first symptoms started,because most of the symptoms were linked to candida, but then everyone around me and even though doctors told me, such an illness doesnt exist and everyone considered me an idiot and doing various tests on me , blood, urine, EKG, reumatology , blah blah, because I have the weirdest symptoms ever, but all came back negative. Then my doctor said: its all in your head plus you have an allergy and that is making your symptoms worse, I was crying so much because I knew she was wrong and although I was never allergic in my life to anything, I went to see a specialist. Then finally I went to my specialist (allergologist), who said she doubts it’s and allergy and if I ever heard of candida albicans which might be the source of my problems. Then I cried again, because for two months I was going from doctor to doctor and for nothing because I thought I had candida in the first place. So one month ago I started the diet, everything was going quite good, although I was eating a lot of nuts, nut butter, brown rice, tomatoes and chicken, believe it or not, my symptoms became better. And then this weekend it all crashed to ground, I started eating chocolate, because I was so low, because I dont go anywhere anymore, because I was so sad and depressed, because I want my life back … Now its the third day on chocolate and I know I have to start again and it has to last for at least hopefully till Christmas I might be healthy because I dont have candida for that long (when I started seeing the symptoms I straight away started solving it). But my problem is I DO NOT KNOW HOW 🙁 I am reading so much about how to get rid of candida and yet I do not understand. So I wanted to ask someone kindly for an advice. SHould I start with a detox and how ? How long should the detox last ? I have read the posts about lemon in the water instead of psyllium and bentonite drink but instead of that what should I eat/take/drink ? What and when should I start taking supplements ? During the detox, first stage or second stage ? I have ThreeLac, Caprylic acid and Virgin coconut oil, how and when should I take them please ? I am sorry about my post being so long, but could someone please help me ? I want my life back… Thank you,  Jenny"
1,Able900,373,"Jenny, below are a few questions which I just answered yesterday. I think the answers cover the questions you had. If you have other questions or concerns, just let us know. Question: “Should I begin taking the antifungals (coconut oil, garlic pills) from the start of cleanse. Or, should i wait until after the die off? What is the most effective route?” Reply: Start the cleanse leaving the antifungals out for the time being. Chicken and fish should be left of out your diet during the cleanse if at all possible. After a week to two weeks of the cleanse, you can start eating more protein sources such as young fish (sardines, herring) or wild salmon occasionally or organic chicken. Organic eggs should remain your main source for proteins throughout the cleanse and treatment.  NOTE: Jenny, in your case, if you’ve already started the coconut oil, I would continue taking it through the cleanse. If you haven’t started it, then just wait until after the cleanse.  After a week to two weeks of the cleanse, you can start an antifungal or probiotic, but choose only one to start with. Stay on the one you choose for at least two weeks before starting another one. If you get the correct ones, 3 or 4 antifungals are enough. Oil of oregano, coconut oil and/or undecenoic acid, and raw garlic and/or garlic pills containing allicin are the best antifungals. A good probiotic is MegaFlora by MegaFood which contains 14 strains and a count of 29 billion. Start with one capsule a day taken on an empty stomach one hour before a meal or two hours after. Question: “Can Molybdenum be taken throughout the cleanse, or should it only be used during the die off?” Reply: Molybdenum can and should be taken from the beginning. It’ll be a life saver during your die-off period as it prevents the toxins from doing so much damage to the body, especially the liver. Jenny, Caprylic acid and coconut oil are excellent, although they’re basically the same thing, however ThreeLac is a waste of your money. Able"
2,jennyska,373,"Hi Able,  Thank you 🙂 I am planning to start with cleanse for a week, drinking lemon water and eating just raw or steamed veggies. After that, if I understand right, will start taking caprylic acid pills and coconut oil and raw garlic and adding to my diet … but I do not know what, since fish and nuts do not do any good to me, so probably just chicken, eggs and probiotic yoghurt and some buckwheat. I know you are speaking about molybdeum? much but what exactly it is and why does it help with candida and if I take so many antifungals is it going to do any harm to me ?  Thank you,  Jenny 🙂"
3,Able900,373,"Hi, Jenny. Quote: I am planning to start with cleanse for a week, drinking lemon water and eating just raw or steamed veggies. After that, if I understand right, will start taking caprylic acid pills and coconut oil and raw garlic and adding to my diet.” Reply: You should start only one of the antifungals at a time. Wait at least two weeks before you start another one. Quote: I know you are speaking about molybdeum? much but what exactly it is and why does it help with candida and if I take so many antifungals is it going to do any harm to me ? Reply: Molybdenum is needed to protect the liver and body in general from the Candida toxins as well as lessen die-off effects. It’s an essential mineral which is already found naturally in the human body, and supplements are available in vitamin stores. Molybdenum is found in many foods, but for a Candida infestation normally more is needed than what’s available in the foods we eat. It’s not going to harm you. About the yogurt, you’ll want to purchase only Organic Non-Sweetened Greek Yogurt with a minimum of sugar content. Oikos and Fage are two of the best brands. You can also make homemade kefir for your diet which would be a great benefit, you can use goat’s milk or even coconut milk if you prefer instead of cow’s milk. Able"
4,raster,373,"Hi Jenny, I just want to say that you are not alone in regards to the depression, loneliness, and the feeling that you cannot control candida and that it has ruined you. I once felt this way as well, and I couldn’t imagine the day that I would start to feel better. Having been on the diet for 4 months now, I feel really great and am more or less symptom free. In the diet you mentioned; I would alter a few food items if possible until phase 2. Primarily the nuts/seeds could be problematic because they contain molds/fungals. Oh and the chocolate…that cannot continue! You know it, it is setting you back! Tomatoes and rice are other things to consider removing; tomatoes are a fruit that contain sugar and rice has small amounts of gluten. Buckwheat is a much better alternative to rice that has almost the same flavor and texture. If you absolutely have to have tomatoes, it won’t set you back too much during the diet. I wouldn’t worry about phase 2 too much yet because its a ways away; just know that during phase 2 you can handle more bad foods. You won’t change the supplements very much at that point, maybe just less antifungals. During the die-off period, I recommend the use of saunas, steam rooms, or even a hot bath at home to help sweat those toxins out. This will almost completely nullify the die off symptoms and will help you recover more quickly. While I haven’t disagreed with able’s statements about molybdenum so far, I do not agree with this statement “It’s not going to harm you.” Molybdenum removes many minerals from your body; mainly metals such as copper, zinc, iron, etc. Your body in general needs these minerals to get better and it could pull out too much from your body depending on your chemistry, makeup, etc. Molybdenum does help heal your gut and does a bunch of other beneficial things; but there is a downside to using molybdenum. Molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys and liver. Undeceonic acid is also an alternative to capryllic acid (aka coconut oil). Dr. Mccoomb states that capryllic acid is only effective the first 6-8 weeks on the diet and after that time, the candida can adapt to it and its less effective. If you’ve already started taking it, I would just use undeceonic acid afterwards when it is done. Another probiotic to consider is HMF neuro; it contains human micro flora which will bind to your intestine walls better than other bovine related probiotics. I would alternate the probiotics you take throughout the treatment to get different kinds in the gut."
5,jennyska,373,"Hey 🙂 Thank you for you answer, I am definitely going to purchase the molybdenum, do you by any chance have any recommended site from which to buy ? Also, I have already bought the ThreeLac and I do not really want to waste it, when do you think I should use that ? Maybe stage 2 ?And concerning the yogurt, how about Activia and other probiotic yogurts found in Tesco’s? does it necessarily have to be greek style one? And if I start like adding antifungals lets say every two weeks another one, wouldnt I end up taking a lot of them at the same time ? Like in detox stage I wouldnt take any, then I will add coconut oil, but can I still eat raw garlic as well ? And after two weeks, I will add f.e. oregano oil and after another two weeks I will add caprylic acid and I end up using molybdenum, raw garlic, coconut oil , caprylic acid and oregano oil daily, isnt that too much ? And is it the same if I add coconut oil to my food and eating a spoon of it ? Can I also ask you, are you a previous candida sufferer ? Thank you Able :)Jenny"
6,raster,373,"It’s best to use the greek yogurt because it contains probiotics and little sugar; there is about 8-11g of sugar per tub. Other yogurts contain something like 17-22g of sugar per serving (tiny tub). This is way too much, more than the daily threshold amount you should set for yourself. Keep the sugar intake to less than 25g a day. You can take many supplements and it is not too much. I wouldn’t worry about it; it’ll help you get better faster. Throw away the threelac, it contains yeast. This is not a helpful product. I wouldn’t take it during any stage. I am a current candida sufferer and have spent hours on this website and listening to dr. mccoombs; this doesn’t make me an expert, but it doesn’t make me a noobie either."
7,jennyska,373,"Hello Raster 🙂  Thank you very much for your reply.. You know I feel like I want just to break down and cry every single day… To be honest with you, candida has taken over my face, nails and stomach as well. I dont worry about my nails and stomach too much , but I really want my face back – every day I have swollen eyes, dark circles, floaters in the eyes and so sensitive eyes to anything and my nails are completely yellow and I either have diarrhea or constipation (and that is just some of my symptoms and I used to have so beautiful face, I feel like this is a punishment for something I did 🙁 you know I feel so …. just so down 🙁 And similarly to you , I dont see myself happy and symptoms free in the future, just as you did, but I really really hope 🙁 How about the greek yogurt from tescos? Is that going to be ok or should I just check the sugar content in it yeah ? Ok I will try to save brown rice and quinoa for stage 2. So buckwheat it is, are the buckwheat flakes ok as well ? I will try to limit the tomato intake for 1 per day I hope that is not going to be so bad. I wanted to ask you, I admire you for the fact that you are on the diet for already 4 months, but how did you manage ? I mean, how about going out, meeting friends, celebrations, etc. or is it something I have to give up for a while ?  Jenny 🙂"

Molybdenum can cause diarrhea, growth retardation, infertility, low birth weight and gout; it can also affect the lungs, kidneys and liver. Raster, the symptoms you’ve named are possible if too much or an overdose of Molybdenum is taken during a short period of time, and a Molybdenum overdoses are extremely rare. Plus, a copper deficiency would already have to be present for it to cause a problem, and then again, an overdose of the Molybdenum would have to be taken for additional symptoms to appear. Taking too much of a probiotic can cause infections which would necessitate a treatment of antibiotics, especially in people with underlying health conditions such as Candida. Too much could cause a gene transfer which means insertion of genetic material into the cells, or it could cause an unhealthy metabolic activity and too much stimulation of the human immune system which would overwork the immune system causing it to crash, or …. should I go on? Too much oil of oregano is toxic to the body and can cause contact dermatitis, excessive vomiting, tingling or numbness in the mouth; it can inhibit iron absorption which leads to anemia and other serious iron-related conditions. Too much calcium will cause muscle weakness, vomiting, and excessive urination leading to dehydration, a too high or low heart rate, kidney stones, and coma. An overdose of magnesium will cause the same symptoms as calcium with the addition of problems with breathing. Too much fruit can cause a Candida infestation. Should we tell even those who have never suffered with Candida that they should discontinue all fruits from their diet, forever? I could add the thousands of possible dangers of overdosing with medications and prescription drugs that most of us are taking at least one of. If all you say is true regardless of an overdose, why is Molybdenum found naturally in the human body without ever taking a supplement? Should we look into having what is already there naturally removed by some unheard of surgery before we all contract the symptoms you mentioned? Isn’t it logical to say that if we should stop taking Molybdenum because of the possible overdose symptoms, we should also stop all of the products and supplements which contain overdose warnings? I assume you can see the complete lack of logic that your statement holds, or are you suggesting that we start including all of the possible side effects and overdose symptoms with every supplement we suggest to the readers? Able"
9,raster,373,"Alright able, I didn’t know about all of the possible side effects of all of these supplements. I’d like to see some links that you may have about molybdenum and candida research if you have them. I just saw this one liner on cancer.org and want to know more “Molybdenum deficiencies are very rare among humans; therefore most practitioners do not recommend supplements.” Then I saw this article: http://candidapage.com/aldehyde.shtml And they said “Molybdenum has a blanket reputation for breaking down yeast by-products into forms that the body could excrete.” I am no expert about molybdenum or even close; I just am skeptical of it working really well as a supplement."

I’d like to see some links that you may have about molybdenum and candida research if you have them. Raster; Only a small portion of the information concerning supplements, herbs, and alternative medicines that I post come from the Internet, most of it comes from notebooks filled with notes I’ve taken over the past 15 years of studying journals and research papers concerning alternative medications, herbs, and the use of supplements and minerals in the treatment of various illnesses as well as notes I’ve made from seminars on alternative health care which I’ve attended over the years. Some of the information has actually come from my own experiments. If I find a specific research study that is posted online, I normally include it in a post.  But I just did a quick search online to see what I could find as far as a notable and trustworthy reference to Molybdenum and Candida toxins, just for you, Raster. Your Quote: And they said “Molybdenum has a blanket reputation for breaking down yeast by-products into forms that the body could excrete.” “Yeast by-products” is of course a reference to the toxins called aldehydes which the dying Candida excrete; Molybdenum nullifies the potency of aldehyde by breaking it down or converting it into acetic acid. The following quote was written by David Schlesinger a licensed acupuncturist who specializes in Candidiasis related illness, multiple chemical sensitivities, and heavy metal toxicity. “We strongly recommend the use of the following supplements along with Formula SF722 to optimize the body’s capacity to neutralize toxins produced by Candida organisms as well as maximizing your immune system’s potential for combating Candida; Molybdenum, Pantethine, Wow Drops and Complete Thymic Formula.” Source: http://www.modernherbalist.com/products/sf722.html The following statement was taken from an article titled, “A Health-Destroying Toxin No One Can Avoid” on the subject of ‘Acetaldehyde Relief” written by Carolyn Pierini, Bachelor of Science in Clinical Laboratory Science, American Society for Clinical Pathology. “….

I think we all know that vitamin and mineral deficiencies are the major cause of most illnesses. I imagine by looking online I could find the same quote concerning just about every vitamin or nutrient known to man. You wrote, “I just am skeptical of it working really well as a supplement.” If you’re speaking of the ability of Molybdenum to reduce the effects of the toxins released by dying Candida, I can personally attest to its success in that area. It’s the only way I was able to withstand the die-off symptoms produced by heavy doses of antifungals as well as the quickly elevated amounts of probiotics and homemade kefir which I subjected myself to in order to cure the infestation as quickly as possible. Of course I don’t recommend doing this to any of the forum readers as it’s dangerous, but I knew what I was doing and was aware of the chances I was taking. Plus, I trusted the Molybdenum to do what I expected it to, and it worked perfectly once I reached the dosage I needed, which was much higher than the recommended dose on the labels. Able"

12,raster,373,"Once you do the diet, you start to feel better after a few weeks. After doing the diet strictly for months, you feel great again! Feeling great again gets you motivated to try harder and live healthier. I now look at most food as being poisonuous. I never thought that this would happen to me considering that I once loved sugar, alcohol, and all of the bad foods you can’t have on the diet. But I look around and see america medicated, overweight, and lazy…and realize that candida has caused great problems to our society. Seeing the problems in america and myself gives me strength to try harder and be healthier. Able: Thanks for the links and post.

Raster, did you ask the doc WHY he was so against it? Does he have the research which proves that it does more harm than good? Those questions would have been my first response to him. You know, just because they have the title “doctor” in front of their names doesn’t make them our decision maker, and it doesn’t mean they know everything there is to know about vitamins and other supplements, or anything else for that matter. In fact, when I’ve visited seminars on alternative health and the healing values of vitamin and mineral supplements, the people who showed the least amount of knowledge on the subject were visiting doctors. I’m aware that you are an active advocate of saunas and soaking in hot baths for expelling the C. albicans toxins, but some of us simply don’t have the time to linger in either one as often and for as long as it takes to do the job alone. Between working, meeting clients, and replying to posts on the forum, I’m doing one of those for about 15 hours a day. That didn’t leave me a lot of time for visiting saunas or soaking for an hour in a hot tub every time I felt the nauseating effects of die-off during my treatment. I’m sure I’m not the only person with a typical day such as that, especially considering the parents who work and take care of several children every day. PS: But a long soak in a hot tub at least once over the weekend is always a nice change. Able"
0,AMcKnight,374,"I just wanted to share my story of how my Candida was healed. I had been an athlete most my life I did competitive cheer and gymnastics and attributed my many yeast infections to thong underwear and sweat. I ate out most days of the week because of my hectic schedule and would consume slices of bread daily as a snack,I was carb addicted but didn’t see an issue since I was so physically fit. After high school my yeast infections got worse even though I was no longer working out so much. I saw gynocologist galore,I changed my soaps,my detergents,my underwear and even one suggested it may be my boyfriend at the time since he was uncircumsized that was causing the issue. It was horrible! At this point I had yeast infections every single month only going a week or two with relief from treatment and then getting yeast infections again. I was finally given a year prescription for Dyflucan and told to just take it once a month. I would cry to my mom constantly I felt embarrassed and tired and half crazy to be honest. I became somewhat of a hermit because I also had dibilitating IBS to the point where I was afraid to leave my house for fear I wouldn’t be able to get to the bathroom in time if needed. This was all very embarrassing to me and made me very depressed. I finally started searching the web and found the candida diet,I took the survey and was convinced this was what I had. A visit to a holistic doctor and a few test later I was diagnosed.I felt so relieved I was willing to do anything at this point because I was so sick.I had constant yeast infections, severe IBS, and a recurring ring worm spot on my arm. I also had acne and severe fatique. My doctor prescribed colloidal silver,probiotics,and the Candida diet. I must say since then,5 yrs ago I’m impressed at how much the diet has gotten better but while back then the diet was pretty basic it was the same concepts and I immediately started to get better. I continued the regimen for 2 months,I dropped 30 pounds healed my gut to where to this day I rarely have a yeast infection or bouts with my IBS and have never gotten ring worm or any fungus related issues since. I am now able to consume sugars and carbs without any issues although I still limit for weight and health reasons. Its been 3 years since ive had any yeast infections, I got one while pregnant but that’s not abnormal. The candida diet changed my life! I felt very alone throughout my journey,none of my friends or family had ever heard of Candida overgrowth but it was websites like this that gave me the tools and recipes to thrive and heal myself through diet. At one point Candida consumed my life but now I never even think about it except when I’m feeling grateful its gone! Do the hard work and you will see results. Its hard, I know ive been there, but its so worth it and when you get sick enough you will do anything to get well. I hope this helped or will inspire someone to dig deep and do what they have to to fight this."

4,kirstyk4,374,"Love hearing your story of success! 🙂 Just curious how long you were on the diet before you were able to eat regular foods again? Do you still eat many of the antifungal foods now in your diet such as garlic, onions, rutabaga? I would love to hear what you do in order to maintain your health but enjoy a variety of food. So glad you are happy and healthy now. I am ready for my life to revolve a little less around this and more on other things! Thanks for sharing!! Kirsty"

It took me a while to get to this turning point. I’m putting this journal out there to document my journey through the changes on the diet, the die off, and the results. Starting tomorrow, which is technically in an hour, and since I’m not eating right now…. basically starting now. 7 day water fast, pure clean spring water w/ coral calcium Then moving onto intermittent fasting and eating the diet plan by Gabriel Cousens. I am expecting to be bed bound with die off the first few weeks, and am looking forward to it so much. I will take some time to document my symptoms. -anxiety (general and social) -anger -depression -fatigue -bloating -flatulence -yeast infections -sugar cravings -athlete’s foot -dandruff -insomnia and low quality sleep -apathy -short attention span, loss of concentration and ability to stay focused -feeling of disconnectedness, especially to people -acne -angular chelitis (candida infection in corners of mouth)"

0,Kots,376,"Hi all, So when I took Levaquin 3.5 years ago my dry mouth started instantly overnight. I woke up one day and ALL I wanted was water and it forced me to quit drinking soda or anything sugared whatsoever. Just as a side note I NEVER drank water back then (I was bad) Here I am years later and it’s getting worse than it ever has. My tongue is thick coated white and yellow with ridges everywhere. I thought for sure after finding this site that maybe the tongue thing is Thrush but now I’m not so sure. It could be just symptoms of my uncurable dry mouth from the Quinolones poisoning that apparently progressively gets worse. I read up on how dry mouth causes yellow and white toungue and I am so constantly thirsty all the time. I started the Oil Pulling with coconut oil 3 times a day and I thought for sure it was working at first. I was wrong. I think gargling with the salt water afterwards has made me even more thirsty than ever. Today my entire tongue is yellow and nasty. I don’t want to go to an ENT cause I know it’s either Candida or just chronic dry mouth from Quinolone poisoning but now I’m thinking maybe I should. It’s the most annoying thing on earth. Does anyone else suffer from this, any thoughts on what I should do? Thank you so much everyone."
1,jamesb,376,"Kots I wake up with a severly dry mouth everyday and believe it to be oral thrush multiplying each night in my mouth. I have tried all the oil pulling with no success and I take coconut oil which I allow to melt in my mouth before swallowing but so far this has not produced any beneficial results. Last night from a suggestion I saw on another post just before bedtime I cleaned my teeth then gargled some coconut milk kefir and swallowed it, DID NOT clean my teeth again before sleeping and woke up this morning with a huge improvement as to the dryness of my mouth. Its only been one night and I am not saying I have it cracked but I am optimistic that this might help. Good luck on your efforts"

3,Kots,376,Thank you. I will try this.
4,Jackie2,376,"Knots, I too have dry mouth badly from Thrush. I found that spreading greek yogurt all over the inside of my mouth helps, as well as oil pulling with coconut oil 3 times a day, and doing the same with kefir…I also will gargle with it. Plus I drink TONS of water I would say at least 8-10 water bottles a day along with hot lemon water 3 times a day. I always have something to drink because of the dry mouth. After one full month of diet my dry mouth had subsided. However, I keep trying new things that made it come back, walnut, almond, sunflower seeds were the worst. I also tried some rice crackers very bad side affects. All of these things gave me dry mouth. The most recent ignorant mistake…popcorn…from a bar no less. Thus I have dry mouth again. I find the kefir to help the most. Best of luck to you. Hope my dumb mistakes help guide you 🙂 Jackie"
0,Rayvynn5374,377,"37 year old female with long history of what I believe is Candida living in Washington DC. For the most part I am a healthy individual. Knock on wood I do not get sick often as in colds and the such. I weigh 115pounds and stand 5 ft 1 in. Approx 12 years ago I started noticing a skin rash on my face. I honestly believed I had ringworm on my forehead. Made an appointment to see the doctor and it was gone by the time I got into see them, matter of days. Over the years it has come and gone. Each time different than any other time, no rhyme or reason for a flare up that I could ever put a finger on. Oh the rash is unbearable, not only does it look disgusting but it itches, burns, flakes and bleeds. I now know it is in my scalp and ears as well. Here are a list of all my symptoms that I have recently began realizing may be all connected. 1.	Tired all the time ( can sleep for hours if left alone, easily awakened and hard time falling asleep) 2.	Crave chocolate all the time 3.	Moody at times 4.	Dizzy with headaches for no apparent reason 5.	Shaky and nauseated when hungry 6.	Irregular menstrual cycles, skip a few months or have them a week apart 7.	Irregular bowel movements (no schedule to speak of, food doesn’t affect “outcome”) 8.	Low libido 9.	Joints ache (hands, knees and ankles) 10.	After consuming alcohol I wake up next morning swollen to the point of clothes will not fit, rings imbedded into fingers 11.	Sudden severe food allergies (tomatoes, all berries, bananas, coconut) 12.	Frequent chunks of yellowish/white stuff dislodging from throat  13.	Very bad breath 14.	Rash I have been to the doctor so many times and tested for all kinds of autoimmune disorders and infections. At one point they put me on Xanax I guess they thought I was crazy, to be honest I feel crazy. Someone who has so much to be thankful for and here I sit complaining something isn’t right, and everyone is like you’re fine nothing wrong. SOMETHING isn’t right!!!!!!  I would like to find a doctor or someone to help me determine if this is indeed what is going on. I do not know where to turn. The internet is full of so much misleading and/or conflicting information. Are homeopathic doctors the only ones who “deal” or diagnose candida? Thank you in advance, Ray"

2,Javizy,377,"Hi, and welcome to the forum. I can sympathise with your frustration with doctors and finding answers by yourself. I think you’ve taken an important step in connecting all your symptoms. The body is a series of interconnected systems that all affect each other, no matter how much doctors like to isolate and drug them. It’s only recently I’ve come to the same conclusion, and it all makes so much sense now. I hope you can find the answers you want here, and I wish you a healthful 2012."

After consuming alcohol I wake up next morning swollen to the point of clothes will not fit, rings imbedded into fingers Xanax works by slowing down the movement of chemicals in the brain that may become unbalanced. This results in a reduction in nervous tension (anxiety). Drinking alcohol while taking Xanax can increase the effects of alcohol. Some Side Effects of Xanax: * unusual risk-taking behavior, decreased inhibitions, no fear of danger; * depressed mood, thoughts of suicide or hurting yourself; * hyperactivity, agitation, hostility, hallucinations; * feeling light-headed, fainting; * seizure (convulsions); * urinating less than usual or not at all; * muscle twitching, tremor; or * jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Less serious side effects may include: * drowsiness, dizziness, feeling irritable; * amnesia or forgetfulness, trouble concentrating; * sleep problems (insomnia); * muscle weakness, lack of balance or coordination, slurred speech; * blurred vision; * nausea, vomiting, constipation, appetite or weight changes; * dry or watery mouth, increased sweating; or * loss of interest in sex."
5,candidamente,377,"Rayvynn5374 wrote: Should I stop running while i am doing the cleanse since there really doesn’t seem to be much “energy” providing nutrition involved? Certainly do not want to harm myself. Exercising helps removing the toxins that the Candida produces while healing, so I personally would not stop exercising, I still exercise in fact, not as much but I still keep it once/twice a week. The Detox Option 1 is the best option in my opinion, because Candida works better when our immune system is low, so we need to feed our body with the good foods that help fight the Candida.  Drink plenty of water and don’t stress too much 🙂"
6,Javizy,377,"I’d worry about where the energy will come from during the cleanse. If you have plenty of fat stores you might be okay, but otherwise you might end up burning muscle. Your metabolism will also need to adjust to a low-carb diet over the first week or so, so you might be in danger of going hypoglycemic if you do any strenuous exercise. We already had somebody mentioning collapsing on the forum, although he didn’t sound at all like a sensible person. It might be better to stick to something light, like yoga, during the cleanse and resume short jogs when you can eat some protein or generally feel up to it (I think the cleanse will take it out of you)."
7,Rayvynn5374,377,I should probably specify that I didn’t take the Xanax at all. Didn’t feel it was needed. I am not real big on meds in the first place. I will attempt to keep walking during cleansing and resume modified running once I am allowed onto stage 2. Something i haven’t found or come aross yet is how do youo knwo when to change stages? Thank you all for the advice and pointers! I really appreciate it.
8,raster,377,"Almost all western doctors will not diagnose you with candida but call it something else. They will give you drugs to address the symptoms but never the root cause. Naturopathic doctors practice holistic medicine where they address the causes of the problem leading to improved permanent health. However the problem is that they occur like colors of the rainbow; finding a good one could prove difficult. The one I go to in town here has clients/customers around the world in countries ranging from brazil to china. I have been lucky finding a good one to say the least! There are expensive tests you can take to help get a positive diagnosis of candida overgrowth but insurance likely will not cover the tests. Dr. Mcoomb’s recommends some in his youtube video, if you want to get as close to a real test there is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri2oNJ_Ea8I He recommends completing 2-3 tests and combine this with your health history, symptoms, including the use of antibiotics to determine whether you have candida overgrowth. You need to figure out what is in the intestinal tract as well as what is in the stool. Genova diagnostic labs has a candida immune complex test and metametrix labs has a GI stool effects test. No western doctor will say that you have it and look at you like you are crazy. A holistic doctor may determine that you have other ailments and specific organs that are damaged and can address these issues seperately. http://www.metametrix.com/  http://www.gdx.net/ If you think you have candida; the only way I think you will know whether you have it or not is to do the diet. If you have “die off” symptoms and feel worse once on the diet, this means you have candida in my opinion. I say give the diet a try and very likely you will see improvement. -Raster"
9,raster,377,"Excessive exercise is not recommended while doing the diet because your body needs the energy to heal. Excercise could lead to the immune system getting too bogged down leading to ineffective healing. However if you were to do light exercise such as walking 15-45 minutes, this could prove to be ideal. I personally got pretty gassed from doing light yardwork and I definitely worked too hard during the earlier part of my recovery. The number one thing you need to recover is plenty of rest. -Raster"

Reply: Taking the Diflucan wouldn’t be undoing the work you’ve already done, but what it would be is a waste of money. Nystatin and Diflucan are both precription antifungals which are no better or stronger than some of the better natural antifungals. Nystatin is supposedly a little stronger than the Diflucan. There is lots of published research on the comparisons between Nystatin and other prescription antifungas with natural antifungals. An example of one such study is below. All plants have a botanical or scientific name, for example, the botanical name for garlic is Allium sativum, for sweet basil it’s Ocymum basilium, and for oregano the name is Origanum vulgare. The following is taken from several published studies comparing oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare) with Nystatin. The antifungal properties of Origanum vulgare oil were examined both in vitro and in vivo. A comparison of the effectiveness of Origanum oil and Nystatin was examined in vitro using Candida albicans in broth cultures. Of the two, it was found that only Origanum oil at 0.25 mg/ml completely inhibited the growth of C. albicans in culture. The germination and the mycelia growth of Candida albicans were both found to be inhibited by Origanum oil in a dose-dependent manner. Studies such as this prove that prescription antifungals are no stronger than an over-the-counter natural antifungal. Able"

I look forward to passing along info as I learn it. Its been a rough 2 weeks, going “cold turkey” off sugar, sodas, caffeine, most carbs but I’ve done it. I know this is only the beginning."
1,Able900,380,"Hello, Kathryn, and welcome to the forum. You’re right, going cold turkey is rough, but when you listen to the people who work up to the diet slowly, they seem to have it just as tough, and in the end, it appears to be more difficult to stick with it than going straight to the diet. Congratulations on making one of the wisest decisions of your life in following the protocol for a cure. Able"

0,Toffeecoo,382,"Hey everyone~ Im new here and new to the horror-story that is candida. Im 23 and, without knowing fully what a yeast infection was, have had it for nearly 3 years on-going. I believe I developed it from having unprotected sex with someone and contracting high-risk HPV(irresponsible and stupid, yes I know. Im paying for it and thanking god it wasnt much worse [not like cervical cancer is the better choice to most things…]), which naturally sent my body astray with all the paps and tests and the cryofreezing procedure (not to mention how much of an emotional wreck I was). The first year my doctor informed me there wasnt enough yeast to constitute an infection so they ruled it out- even though I had every symptom except for the yeast. Oh lord, the itching was nearly unbearable. I concluded since there was no yeast, it had to be the HPV, but all my doctors assure me that that isnt a side effect of it. So all plausible causes cancelled I ended up purchasing a cream called Balneol to help with the itching, it did for a short while, but I’d need to bathe in it to feel a semblance of “normal” again :< So I further concluded that I was simply broken. Through-out all of this, I continued to have unprotected sex with that person, and the one thing that always came up was how ""raw"" it made him. After reading Able's post about body pH, I think my vagina was trying to fend off the infection by increasing the acidic levels? Pretty cool imo, if that's what it was doing. Second year, my new doctor prescribed me a week’s worth of antibiotics and an insert-cream. Candida came back a weak later with more apparent vaginitis symptoms, however the antibiotics seemed to have “cured” the possible high acidic levels… which now that I think about it, probably caused the vaginitis symptoms that was keeping the discharge at bay. 😐 I did nothing about it, as I figured it would go away on its own eventually since, well, I did take the medication? I was also very depressed at the time and have never been very in-tune with my body- but I never ate poorly. I drank alcohol once a year [creme de menthe on christmas], I dont smoke, and Ive always been repelled by fastfood. Soda was my only enemy, but I drank as much soda as I did black tea and laughed at all decaf beverages (I like to stay awake… a lot. Recently I can never get enough sleep and I faceplant my desk very often trying to focus on work :< but I havent touched an energy drink in a long time, soda has been a ""treat"" once a month for 2 years, yay!) But still, I couldnt force myself to read up on or understand Candida until year 3. On the third year I developed full-blown vaginitis. We tried the cream again, nothing. When it got _really_ bad, he prescribed me the 24(or 12?) hour pill… which also failed and thus began my adventure of looking for alternative methods. Like peeling and slitting a piece of garlic and inserting it overnight 😐 which doesnt work, in case anyone was curious. I thought about using yogurt.. but I’d rather eat it. I became a nervous wreck and 2 weeks after my period I began seeing blood in the discharge (black spotting sort of blood). This sent me into a chaotic state and I started wondering if perhaps the candida went systemic? Would I need to see a gastrointestinal specialists? If its in my blood stream, do I need to see an infectious disease specialist? Turned out, my period just came early (but honestly none of my friends or anyone I can think of has spotted a whole week like it was the end of their period!) A lot of talks with the other half I went a step more serious and natural in my control of candida. Thus I discovered the Candida Diet I confronted my doctor about it and he disregards any notion that the flora in the intestine is the cause of vaginitis. I dont like to argue with people 40+ years my senior or with a PH D in vaginas, but I thought it was pretty biased and ignorant for him to pass it off so quickly and be happy to offer me another prescription. He’s a nice guy, Ill go back for my pap, but I do believe Im going to leave all doctors out of my personal Candida crisis space. So here I am! I found a blog: http://middleearthhome.com/health/candida-experiment/ that, after a month of trying this diet, has highly encouraged me to make my own. Its a wonder how much more anal about my intake I’ve become just writing down my daily food log. Its also nice to see someone’s daily adventures in this, gives me hope. I’ve decided to restart myself with the diet. I found this website about a week ago, her journal 3 days ago… and it clicked to read the forums! and Im sure this is going to be it! Total soldier through this, ladies(and gentlemen)! So I come bearing a few questions: (some deleted due to being answered! hehe, they were kind of ignorant anyway after catching up on the forum’s diet low-down.) Has anyone took or is taking Candida Clear? Im a poverty-stricken art student with (as mentioned) a lot of medical bills (recently diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease and Im sure the 2 epidurals in a month arnt helping stress levels of mind and body.) So Im triyng to limit the $20-$50 nutritional tablets in favor of rent. The other capsule Im taking is Acidophilus <3 which unquestionably helps. With these two I think I have a strong fight against the candida. But what are your opinions? Last but not least, instead of using the detox specified on this website, my friend referred me to: https://www.herbdoc.com Dr. Schulze’s 5-Day Detox program. They swear by it, so I’ve started it. I want to say Im experienceing “die-off” symptoms, but I dont want to jinx myself before I know. Having just finished another menstrual cycle, Im waiting to see if the vaginitis is still around– –Which brings me to my ultimate question: how do you know when you’re clear? Will the vaginitis suddenly disappear? do I need more cream to finish it off in there? I was thinking I was going to use the state of it’s severity as an indicator to how well my bodys fighting the candida in my gut. Anyone else have other methods? ps: this diet isnt so bad. I gripe a lot about missing cookies, pancakes (buckwheat tastes like ass), frenchtoast, and toast with jam. But I do believe Im going to continue to eat like this 4/7 days of the week… but Im fantasizing here, I have months ahead of me. To be sure though, the first meal Im going to have when I decide Im safe enough to eat normal food… is a giant stack of pancakes swimming in maple syrup 😐 /probiotics scream in horror"

Acidophilus Glucosamine (for my back) Twin Lab’s Daily One Caps Ive stopped taking them the last 2 days since Ive started my detox, I didnt want to flush them with everything else. Bad idea? LOTS of water, attempted 3x daily Apple Cider Vinegar, the occasional Emergen-C 1kmg Vitamin C powder packs, Paud’arco and Spearmint. Would it be ok to continue to drink the Chai yerba mate with plain Almond milk instead of rice? Candida Clear – I was ordering a bottle of Caprylic acid (after reading that Forum’s Protocol post) when I discovered it… so I found it for half off and bought 2 last night, before I knew this information about rice. Seems weird they’d make a bottle just-for without fully studying the rice? I’ve grown up of the mindset that if it says its for x,y,z then its safe for x,y,z. I find it hard to believe they wouldnt study an illness to its fullest and end up prescribing something that sustains it :< My diet (before I began trying to follow the site’s guidelines) mostly consisted of noodles, cheese, few fruits and veg, and mostly bread/tuna/jam/meat and cheese. Current diet: I have no daily regimen since I have a sinking suspicion my lethargia and need to sleep for 12 hours (literally) is due to the overgrowth and lack of nutrients. Breakfast: eggs over easy ontop of spinach with self-made turkey sausage (turkey patties really) and occasionally plain yogurt (whole or half tub). Snacks: Cucumbers, Tomatoes, celery (with Lara Scudder’s peanutbutter- I read afterward all nuts contain mold 🙁 so I havent eaten it in a week.), boiled eggs, avacados. Before I knew fish were ruled out avacados, mayo, and tuna combinations for a more ‘hearty’ meal. Ive been eating Cascade Fresh’s plain 2lb yogurt containers at least once a day for a month before I started the diet. Im not eating them as much anymore with 2,3 or even a week’s span between purchasing a tub, but I definitely would like to continue pounding it back if I could. And the occasional sweet potatoe with butter. Dinners: Trying to follow the recipes listed for Dinners on the site, but Im branching out and making my own recently. Turkey pasta was one, beef wrapped asparagus, steak marinated in olive oil, herbs, and garlic (cooked in onions and ginger), lots of quinoa and brown rice. I was eating beans the first few weeks (thanks to another website saying I could) for more protein with the brown rice, but Ive cut them out in the last 2 weeks after discovering this site. Carrots more recently since a previous website didnt recommend them (tried replacing them with parsnips, but as I read.. parsnips are a starch, and so they’ve been cut out.) I tried making mashed turnips, but.. they tasted pretty bad and cutting them into squares is a bitch, so I think Im eliminating that side from the menu. Thats about it, combinations of veggie broth + quinoa, rice, steamed artichokes, broccoli, asparagus, snowpeas(sauteed in butter occasionally), sweet peppers, and squash. Its hard to stick to so few foods when my other half eats whatever he wants, AND a lot of sweets, he’s not adjusting very well to my new diet recipes so we’re having to buy to sets of diets and me cooking 2 different sides to accommodate his needs :<raster wrote: Rice milk is not on the allowed food lists because it is highly inflammatory and contains starch, sugar.Able900 wrote: Candida Clear contains rice flour and gum Arabic, both of which can sustain Candida albicans.

4,raster,382,"Stick to the foods allowed list: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1136_ALLOWED-FOODS-LIST.aspx As you can see, tomatoes are not included, nor is beef. Beef/pork can cause a bunch of ammonia production, so this is to be avoided if possible. Tomatoes have sugar and should be eaten sparingly. I would avoid the peanut butter and switch to fresh almond butter during phase 2 (don’t worry about this yet). If you were to eat greek yogurt, this would be OK, it contains probiotics and less sugar than all other yogurts. You should do this 2 weeks into phase 1 of the diet after the cleanse. Kefir is also a way more effective alternative (contains way more probiotic). Try to keep your daily sugar intake to below 25g. Brown rice is also not on the list because it is inflammatory, contains starch, and low amounts of sugar. If you were to switch to buckwheat, this would be a very good alternative. Also, red/black rice may be OK (give it a test). If you were to rotate between buckwheat, black/red rice, and quinoa as a side dish, the candida won’t be able to adapt very well to the diet. Carrots contain sugar and should be used sparingly if possible. As far as the veggies, my only other concern would be starch content. A great website to look up some info on your foods is here: http://nutritiondata.self.com/ Seafood is allowed, and it would be best to rotate between it and chicken (or turkey). Flours you can use for cooking include coconut flour, almond meal, buckwheat flour, and teff flour. Oat bran would also be OK if you eat it once every 3 days or so (not too often). I am wondering what billion count your probiotic contains? If its like 1-10 billion, I would upgrade to a much higher count when this bottle is up. Megaflora contains 14 different strains at a 50 billion count and HMF Neuro contains 12.5 billion (5 strains) and contains human micro flora. The probiotics are the single most important thing you will need for your recovery. You will also want to take different vitamins. The multivitamin contains soy and glucose, which will benefit the candida. I would check out this post for other good ideas: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1173_Vitamins-Minerals-Herbs.aspx I take vitamin C (with bioflavanoids), mg/calcium/zinc, and vitamin D is very important (cod liver oil) to reduce inflammation. You can take it even further if you want to…but the multivitamin isn’t giving you the proper ratio/amount of vitamins you need to get over candida. Good luck and hope this helps! -Raster"

At my local health food store, we have this peanut butter making machine, where you press a button and fresh almond butter is made immediately until you press the button again.

My only other recommendation is to get some SF722 undecenoic acid by thorne research (in a month or two). This is a highly effective antifungal that works better than most other antifungals for a long period of time. Candida can adapt to any antifungal, but not very well to SF722.

1,Able900,384,"Hello, Eileen, welcome to the forum. Your symptoms: thrush: For the thrush you should do the oil pulling therapy. It works. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst734_ORAL-THRUSH.aspx tiredness: This is part of the Candida symptoms; as the Candida is cured, the fatigue will lessen. mood swings: For these you might try an herb called Ashwagandha. joint aches: Again, this is one of the Candida symptoms which will lessen as you cure the infestation. Meanwhile, if they are severe you can take ibuprofen. In several studies, ibuprofen was shown to revert certain Candida albican’s resistance to antifungal azoles.  http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/56/4/678.full nausea: Another of the Candida effects. cravings: That’s the Candida wanting you to feed them what they like. As their numbers decrease, the cravings will also. headache: The Candida albicans produce various chemicals which are toxic to the human brain as well as other parts of the body. The chemicals include alcohols, aldehydes and hydrogen sulfide. When the chemicals reach the brain they pass through the blood vessels; the natural reaction is for the blood vessels to swell as an inflammatory response, when this takes place in the brain, you can imagine how this would cause a headache. sinus: Sinus problems during a Candida infestation is a sign of possible sinus yeast infection. Oral, nasal and vaginal yeast are a sign that the Candida fungus has infested the gastrointestinal tract to the extent of the beneficial being at an extremely low point; when this happens the immune system is most affected, and the entire body can suffer from infections.

0,alexquinn,385," Possible Contributing Factors to Candida Overgrowth: 1.) I’ve been running cross-country all four years of highschool, but this last summer, my workout regimen was particularly stressful, I was running twice a day, doing over 65 miles a week in order to further my position on the varsity team and in hopes of being a large contributor to the team’s success for my senior year. I was putting my body under huge amounts of physical stress. On a side note, my acne started mildly at this point 2.)I got poison oak or some sort of allergic reaction to a similar oil, and my doctor prescribed me 20 days of prednisone, a steroid. This is when my acne started to get even worse, all the while I am still running. 3-4.)The school year started and I was swamped with 5 AP classes plus regular courses and literally never had enough time to do my schoolwork. I would get home from practice after school at 7:30-8 and and I’d have way too much work to complete in that time. As a result, I found myself staying up to 2-4am half the week to complete the work, getting completely sleep deprived. The other nights of the week, I simply didn’t do any homework in order to get a good nights sleep and I’d find myself stressing out a lot at school. I was worrying about schoolwork, applying for colleges, and – most of all – not having enough time in the day to get all of the things I needed done, done. I was under huge amounts of psychological stress. Around this time, my acne was starting to get really bad, and I was starting to feel sick in general. My quality of performance in cross-country started to decrease. 5.) This whole time, I’d been consuming a runner’s diet, one that is highly rich in carbs. Most days of the week I would eat white pasta for dinner, oats for breakfast, and bread rolls, pretzels, and high sugar fruits for lunch. After practice I would drink copious amounts of Gatorade, and in the summer – on several occasions – I remember drinking entire half-gallons of chocolate milk after running. 6.) Since I was feeling so sick, and had moderate cystic acne by this time(two really big cysts that wouldn’t go away on one cheek and small cysts elsewhere), I visited the doctor. Lo and behold, for my cystic acne, future acne should it occur, and the tiredness that I was experiencing, he prescribed me 44 days worth of antibiotics (14 of augmentin and 30 of doxycycline)!!! At the time, I thought, well, I hope I get better. Halfway into the anti-biotic regimen, my acne started exploding, with cysts everywhere! I’m also feeling really tired and run down at this point. My lymph nodes on my neck and under my jaw are really hard and inflamed. Also, I’m having sever constipation, hardened, dis-colored stool, and abdominal/back/side pains. 6 1/2) This point basically just rules out other sicknesses. I take a trip to the doctors and they do blood tests after I explain to them what symptoms I’ve been experiencing. The mono test came back negative, the “inflamation”/ sedimentation rate test came back negative, the thyroid issue test came back negative, and my blood count was relatively normal (I even have the results and I think it’s odd that my white blood cell count isn’t up, though my monocyte and lymphocyte count is slightly elevated but barely, for any of you medically knowledgeable people out there). My doctor sent me on my way, hoping one of the tests would tell whats wrong, but nothing did. This was also before thanksgiving so I’m sure my mother will be scheduling another appointment after the break. 7.) Near the very end of the anti-biotic regimen, I started to experience severe constipation, abdominal/groin/back/side pains, and other digestive troubles such as dis-coloration of stool. I knew something was wrong when I ate three heaping plates of thanksgiving food, and only a few turds were produce from it (I know, ew, it’s still inside me). 8.) My last and final point has to do with how I feel after eating sugar and how I react to alcohol. I have noticed that when I drink an energy drink or anything really high in simple carbs, I feel tipsy, like seriously buzzed, like I want to take a long nap, like you feel when you drink alcohol! For example, at my thanksgiving meal, I was throwing down potatoes, sweet-potatoes, baked-pineapple, and cranberry juice, and granted I felt a little weird but I just thought I was full. Then when I drank a single glass of wine, I wanted to pass out. I mean I wanted to pass out in the way that you feel after downing shot after shot on your birthday and then losing all night at the beer-pong table. I had felt this way before, but never after one single glass of wine! Tell me if you think I have candidiasis or not ^^^ hahah."
1,Able900,385,"Well, if you don’t have Candida I’m not on earth right now, and I’m pretty damn sure I am. There’s only one way you’re going to get better, and that way doesn’t include antibiotics. These are nothing more than a doctor’s response when his conclusion is, “I have no idea what this person’s problem is.” The only way you’re going to heal yourself is by following a Candida treatment. All the information you need to get started is in one place, the link is below. The Protocol: http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1334_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx After you read the entire protocol, let us know about any questions you have. Able"
2,raster,385,"Sounds like it…western doctors will never diagnose candida, and they don’t know enough about human health. The antibiotics made things worse because not only did they kill off the bad bacteria in your gut, but also the good bacteria. This caused an immune system imbalance, allowing the candida to flourish. If you continue on for a period of weeks/months without doing the diet, things will only get worse. I would consider getting other tests. Dr. Mcoomb’s recommends some in his youtube video, if you want to get as close to a real test there is: http://www.youtube.com/w…a8I&feature=related He recommends completing 2-3 tests and combine this with your health history, symptoms, including the use of antibiotics to determine whether you have candida overgrowth. You need to figure out what is in the intestinal tract as well as what is in the stool. Genova diagnostic labs has a candida immune complex test and metametrix labs has a GI stool effects test. No western doctor will say that you have it and look at you like you are crazy. A holistic doctor may determine that you have other ailments and specific organs that are damaged and can address these issues seperately. http://www.metametrix.com/  http://www.gdx.net/ If you think you have candida; the only way I think you will know whether you have it or not is to do the diet. If you have “die off” symptoms and feel worse once on the diet, this means you have candida in my opinion. I say give the diet a try and very likely you will see improvement. -Raster"
0,Mrs.Carly,386,"I think I’m losing my mind…really I do. I’ve been following what I thought was the candida diet for the past 5 weeks. I went to a holistic doctor originally for allergy/food intolerance testing. According to the results that I received in how my body reacts to yeast products, she felt that I have a candida overgrowth. I have to say I agree with her as I had heard about it in the past. Well, she gave me a food plan that goes according to my allergy results, which by the way came back as intolerant to gluten, casein, whey, lime, most melons, cranberries, most beans, and an actual allergy to yeast and egg. I eliminated these foods and my abdominal pain went away. I’m also not nearly as gassy as I once was, PHEW! The problem is that the list she gave me included starchy foods that I could eat, coffee, grapefruit was allowed, she just told me to stay away from sugars and use stevia instead. She also told me to stay away from Chocolate and black tea. I have followed her to the letter, but after 3 weeks I started doing my own research and found that I should NOT be eating potatoes, grapefruit, and other starches (Rice, corn), so I cut that out, I felt like CRAP for 4 straight days, goodness! It was awful. I emailed my holistic dr. and she said that I was experiencing some die off symptoms. Great, I figured that one out. Here is my issue, she NEVER mentioned that I could not have coffee. I am very annoyed by this as I have continued to drink my coffee and take my probiotics (Anyone heard of syntol). At first she told me I would only have to be on this strict program for 6 weeks, then would meet with her and go from there, BUT after telling her about my die off symptoms and my concerns, she had me buy another bottle of Snytol to extend it to 9 weeks on this diet. I have not cheated ONCE, at least not on purpose. No cakes, no cookies, no sugar, NOTHING!!!!!!!! I would hate to think that the past 5 weeks has been a total waste because of what I did NOT know, and because of coffee. I have been irritable (god bless my husband for putting up with me), and just EXHAUSTED!! I keep hearing about how people are getting this great energy boost. Where the heck is mine!!??!?!? I’m struggling so much, ESPECIALLY because of the stupid allergies that I have on top of this candida stuff. I am SO SO SO scared that I will never get better. I took that candida spit test and WOW, okay yea it seems that things are still really bad. it took no time for my spit to create strands and make it’s way to the bottom (nasty). What are you guys eating? Please give me some kinda help, give me an example of what you are eating. I feel like I’m hungry all the time, I usually feel a slight headache too on most days. Maybe 8 glasses a water isn’t enough for me and I need to up the intake. Any advice would be greatly appreciated as I don’t feel like I’m getting enough clear guidance from my holistic doctor. Thanks, carly"
1,Able900,386,"Hello, and welcome to the forum. Your story is very typical for almost anyone who has visited a doctor in order to obtain directions for a Candida cure. Quote: I am very annoyed by this as I have continued to drink my coffee and take my probiotics. Reply: I’m guessing you’re read our opinions concerning coffee, with our without caffeine. Quote: Anyone heard of syntol? Reply: Syntol generally contains a 13.5-billion count and eight strains of beneficial bacteria. This is alright for the first month or so, but it wouldn’t work on a long term basis, it’s just too weak. After finishing the bottle, you should change to a higher count and more strains. The following link is the forum’s general protocol, the one we’ve been telling the members about for months, and it seems to be helping most of them if not all. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postsm5764_From-Able-and-Raster-The-Protocol.aspx#post5764 Let us know if you have questions. Able"
2,Mrs.Carly,386,"Yea, I’ve been following the program as was given to me by my holistic doctor (the first 3 weeks). In the past 2 weeks I’ve cut out pretty much all starches, and fruits. My meals consist of chicken, lean beef, lean ground pork, turkey breast, fish, and shrimp. My carbs are mainly from green veggies (Okra, spinach, lettuce, etc.). My fats come from coconut oil, olive oil, flax seeds and avocado. Calories average 1300-1500 per day, carbs are usually less than 60 grams per day. I notice that I get headaches almost daily and had a bad headache today. I’ve stopped drinking coffee, and this is my second day not drinking coffee. Even so, when I DID drink coffee, it has never been more than a half a cup. I’m not a huge coffee drinker. I’m wondering if I should cut nuts out of my diet too. I notice that although I love almonds, walnuts, and seeds, I get some stomach discomfort after eating them. On a good note, I’ve lost 12 pounds in the past 5 weeks. My weight is much easier to keep off than before. I’ve always struggled with weight loss, but after discovering that “good for you foods” like oatmeal, whole wheat products, and glutenous products are REALLY REALLY REALLY bad for my body. I can’t tolerate it at all. I’m just still concerned that I’m “cheating”. I don’t mean to, but because of the headaches I’m wondering if I’m still consuming something that I should not. Thanks for your help"
3,Able900,386,"Good evening, Mrs. Carly. You seem to be eating an awful lot of animal protein which really doesn’t have a positive effect on a Candida infestation. One reason is the ammonia that’s released from the protein when it breaks down in the body. Ammonia is beneficial to the Candida, and not your liver which is already working hard to remove the toxins released by both the dying and living Candida. Try sticking mostly to organ eggs for your protein, and adding fish and organic chicken (if possible) to your meals three or four times a week for at least a while. You really should be eating pork or beef at all during the treatment. You should definitely remove all nuts and seeds from your diet for at least a month, and then perhaps eat on almonds a few times a week for another month or two. Nuts generally are hard on the digestive system, plus they all contain a certain amount of mold which is detrimental to the Candida treatment. You mentioned both oatmeal and whole wheat products; if you’re eating regular supermarket oatmeal, this can feed the Candida, so can all wheat, even whole wheat. An excellent oat product which is acceptable for the diet is organic oat bran made by Bob’s Red Mill. Amazon carries this product. http://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Organic-18-Ounce/dp/B000ED9L9E If you’ve not already done so, you really should read the “Allowed Foods” post.  http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1136_ALLOWED-FOODS-LIST.aspx Let us know if you have questions. Able"
4,Mrs.Carly,386,"I don’t eat oatmeal, I used to, but i showed an allergic reaction to it.I don’t eat wheat products…I was saying that I USED to, and the years of eating this way led to this. I can’t eat eggs, Allergic to it. The reason why I eat so much meat is because I’m starving, all the time. I am always hungry and never feel full. I’ve even cut back on exercising in hopes that will help. It hasn’t. Chicken is nasty heated up (I work 40-50 hours a week and rely on leftovers a lot), but I will eat more of it if you think it will help. So basically this diet is just veggies mainly? WOW, not really a whole lot you can do in a day when you are living off of just vegetables. I still have to have energy to go to work, and the gym. I’ve already dedicated 5 weeks to this. I don’t want to dedicate much more. I want to eat fruits again. I want to stop feeling so tired every single day. For the past 10 years of my life I’ve had abdominal pain from eating foods I’m allergic to. This doesn’t seem much better. I still don’t feel very good. I don’t mind avoiding sugar, but I’m also not supposed to eat the same thing every day. My doctor told me if I eat chicken, I can’t eat it again for 3 days. Doesn’t leave a lot of choices if I eat chicken one day, and Fish the next, and just vegetables the next day? I just don’t understand how I can live on just vegetables! I am already starving as it is!! Do you have any other recommendations?? This is why I asked for an example of what people are eating in a day, a menu if you will. I already know about the list, but you are saying not to eat much meat. I am EXTREMELY confused. If someone would just give me a generic menu, It would be helpful. meal 1: X Y Z Meal 2: X Y Z Thanks"
5,monita,386,"Hi Carly, I know what you’re going through, it can be really difficult in the beginning to try to think of different things to eat and to try to plan meals… especially when you have to go to work. I know that I was so used to going out to buy a sandwhich, soup, some sushi or other such foodstuffs readily available in the shops. I also loved cereal and coffee for breakfast and found this hard to give up. There is a recipe section within the Forum that all the members have been adding to. This is split up into Breakfast, Main meals and snacks. This has helped me quite a bit. To give you an idea of what I would have for a few days though: Day 1 -Breakfast: Small pot of natural, unsweetened, Greek yogurt (sometimes with a slice of coconut bread with coconut oil on it if I am hungry). -Lunch: Large bowl of veggie noodle soup made from yeast and sugar free stock (any veg on the allowed list with some buckwheat noodles, often called ‘Soba’ noodles) with two or three slices of coconut bread with coconut oil on it. (I make the soup in the morning and put it in a flask for work) -Snack: coconut cookies -Evening Meal: White fish marinated in olive oil and a few spices or ‘coconut aminos’ with a variety of vegetables. Day 2 -Breakfast: small glass of kefir and a few coconut pancakes with a dollop of Natural greek yogurt -Lunch: Large bowl of veggie soup (different veggies to the day before) with a few slices of coconut bread – Snack: Small pot of Natural greek yogurt – Evening Meal: Green veggie egg foo yung (from forum recipes) Another great breakfast is a couple of soft boiled eggs with a few slices of toasted coconut bread. You can find the recipe for two versions of the bread in the forum recipe section under main meals I believe. My boyfriend has perfected a korma curry recipe made with a variety of mild spices and coconut milk and coconut cream. I have that maybe once a fortnight with chicken, some buckwheat and two or three steamed veggies e.g butternut squash and broccoli. I also have stirfry quite a bit (without rice of course) and just add a small handful of frozen prawns or a few small strips of chicken and use oil mixed with some garlic and light spices or some ‘coconut aminos’. I try to have a couple of veggie days followed by a ‘meat/fish’ day then veggie days followed by a meat day in an attempt to try to keep amonia producing foods to a minimum. I would say that the coconut bread is a lifesaver in terms of hunger control. I’m now at the stage where I am not hounded by hunger in between meals. My meals tend to fill me up for quite some time. I hope you’ve found this helpful. :o)"
6,Lucylu,386,"Hi Mrs Carly. I feel for you with the hunger, it’s certainly tough at the start. I’ve found that buckwheat bread (look at the recipe threads) & cooked buckwheat have been a life saver. Also I’ve found plain buckwheat crispbread thats a handy filler too. My daily diet would look something like:- Breakfast – 3 poached organic eggs on buckwheat bread (spread with coconut flour). I realise you can’t have eggs so how about avocado? Late morning – Chicken “gruel”!! Every few days I boil up the bones of an organic chicken, throw loads of veg in, a few handfuls of buckwheat to thinken… cook tthrough, season & blitz. Makes a nice thick soup. a big bowl of it certainly fills a gap. Early Afternoon – A mix of all types of salad leaves, rocket, pea sprouts, alfafa, an avodaco, homemade coleslaw/ dressing, maybe some leftover chicken or a tin of sardines or wild salmon. Late afternoon – Buckwheat crispbreads with coconut oil. I found some black olive pate today (just black olives, olive oil, salt) so thats nice and tasty on them. Dinner – either organic chicken or some sort of wild fish. The fish is tasty spread with coconut oil and baked/ grilled. Served with roast veg (I do several days worth at a time – slow cook eggplant, red onion, white onion, garlic, zucchini, loadsa olive oil, salt & pepper – cover tightly so it goes mushy and holds the flavour rather than crisping & drying out). I usually have a few days worth of mashed swede in the fridge too – this serves instead of potatoes. Jerusalem artichokes every 2nd day… either mashed or roasted in chunks – they’re v tasty. And then some steamed veg like broccoli or spinach too. Having such a wide selection of veg I could easily go without the chicken/ fish every 3rd day… but you have to make sure all the rest is pretty tasty and also looks good on the plate otherwise its just not going to satisfy! Late snack – I usually don’t need one after the big dinner but I’ve made up a sweet zucchini cake which satisfies any late night sugar cravings – recipe on the recipe thread. Throughout the day I drink lemon squeezed into hot water, probably 12 mugs. Always have one nearby… even in a travel mug when I’m in the car! This probably staves off any hunger too. Best of luck with it… I hope you work out soon what suits and what fills you up. Lucy"
7,raster,386,You can eat oat and rice bran; these are the healthy parts of the grain and contain no starch or sugars. Also try the pumpkin muffin bread recipe. Buckwheat is a great item to eat; be sure to balance it off with some cod liver oil to counteract the inflammation properties of the buckwheat. Chicken sausage is also a great item (get the fresh non packaged stuff). Switch to green tea instead of coffee; it has anti-inflammatory properties. Read the “about that hunger” post. Eat more seafood and switch between seafood and chicken. Add inulin to your food to heal the leaky gut. Get a stronger probiotic or make some kefir. -Raster
8,Mrs.Carly,386,"Thanks for the suggestions…the diet is more difficult for me because of the 20 something foods that i showed a reaction to. Most of these foods were of course things that I ate daily, like eggs. I’ve never tried buckwheat, I will look into that. For some reason I have a really hard time with grains. I have a hard time with everything! Except protein and a few vegetables. Well here is to giving it my best shot while out of town for thanksgiving week. I haven’t “cheated” on my “avoid these foods” plan for my food allergies. I have avoided all forms of sugar. It isn’t so bad anymore. Sometimes my cravings are still there but I’m so used to saying no that it is just getting easier."

I have trouble with my health and diet for many many years and even I tried and try to figure out what I am allergic too and write a daily food journal. I am not managing to get it straight what I am allergic too. When I have a reaction I think ahh, that’s it. So I stop with it but still I am feeling bad. Then after some days I might try it again. I want to get one single week symptom free so I can test single foods. I never managed to get that start. I even went on a fasting, thinking if I don’t eat anything I will get my start. But it didn’t work out either hundred percent, it worked some but I didn’t get totally sympthomfree. Maybe the candia was dying off while fasting and I felt terrible from that. I have no Idea. Can you tell me what you did to be so sure that you are allergic to which food? What are the most reliable testing s for food? When I ask my doctor he said that one cant test food. I should write down what I eat. I do this for 8 month now but I am not wiser. thanks Thomas"
10,Mrs.Carly,386,"Hi Thomas! Western medicine, my my humble opinion, do not believe in treating the problem, but rather the symptoms. You take pills for that, then have to take more pills for the side effect so on. I went to a holistic doctor here in Town. She did a blood test…it cost me $350.00 for this very extensive blood test but I showed a positive reaction to several foods and an actual allergic reaction to yeast and eggs. According to her, food intolerance and food allergies are just different in that one shows an immediate reaction (and allergies can be more severe) and the other shows a delayed reaction (up to 3 days later it can pop up). I paid for the food allergy test and the visits with the holistic doctor out of my own pocket, insurance will not cover, BUT I no longer have the abdominal and back pains i used to have when I cut it out. Most of my migraines have gone away too. I’m still battling the candida though. After my thanksgiving week vacation I am going to really reevaluate my diet and make some more cuts. I am not cheating by any means, but there are some things that I can do to improve, for sure. I would HIGHLY recommend seeking a holistic doctor. She is the one that told me about the candida overgrowth (well I had come across this possibility several years ago, but didn’t want to do the diet). Since then, my thoughts have changed!"

Here in Sweden it is very difficult to find a holistic doctor. I heard that 3 doctors are in problems, they want to remove their licence because they, as normal doctors gave people homoeopathic medicine. For me to find one good holistic doctor I think I will have to google with the right search words. yours thomas"
12,Lucylu,386,"Mrs Carly & Thomas – It’s actually a holistic doctor that diagnosed my candida too. she does full food allergy testing using a vega test machine – there’s a picture and explanantion in this link:- http://drjenniferdaly.com/treatments.html It takes an hour for her to take a history of your symptoms & go through all the things you eat. She’s a medical doctor as well as having several qualifications in alternative areas. Inititial consultation €85 and follow on is €70.

0,89Mirageman,387,"I have had stomach isses for as long as I can remember. I’m a 33 y/o male and over the last 2 years or so I’ve had this dull pain in my lower right side, mostly after meals. I’ve also been a diabetic (type II) for about 10 years now and didn’t really look after myself like I should have for most of those. Mainly just ate anything that I wanted and took my medication. It seems the pain is worse right after meals but only when I am sitting or laying down. If I stand its completely gone. A few months ago I started searching online for the symptoms and tried the gluten free diet for about a month with no real progress. Then I stumbled across candida and a little light bulb came on and I realized I was finally onto something. I did the spit test and within minutes there were huge strings hanging down almost reaching the bottom of the glass. I took one of the online tests and scored very high and was told more than likely it was candida. This brings me back to my first question though. What type of stomach issues do you guys/girls have with candida? I was diagnoced with gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) back in June along with a Hiatal hernia. I have lost about 35 lbs since June by cutting back and exercising and am feeling much better these days. It does seem like the pain is not as intense so maybe its my gut/intestines healing."

Sometimes it was sticking me like a knife but not so often. Since I am doing the diet Able and raster are doing here on the forum I don’t have pain any-more in the stomach.

4,Able900,387,"Hello, Thomas. With a Candida albicans infestation, the infestation often causes the entire gastrointestinal tract to be inflamed, this includes the stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, liver, small intestine, and appendix as well as the large intestine or colon. During the infestation inflammation often occurs in any of one these areas or more, and it’s also possible that pain is experienced in one of these parts when the actual source of inflammation is happening in another area of the body; this is the way of the human body. What I’m saying is that it’s perfectly normal to experience pains in these areas of your body. The dizziness and achiness or pain in your muscles can be caused by die-off toxins of the dying Candida.

I hope I remember to help others when I am ok again and not drift off in the unknown spaces of the internet. To even give you are clearer picture, how you and raster helped me I liked to say some words more. I was following a candida diet from the internet which focused mainly on fats and protein. So I was eating a lot of meat. My body collapsed as you know and I wrote about. Then I was sure my misery had to do with the fact that I was lacking sugar and broke the old diet in a extreme way eating everything again only not to suffer these terrible symptoms I got from the meat diet. You said, that I am not suffering from sugar loss and you where right. You too said I should not eat so much meat and you where right with this too. I am following now your diet here on the forum for a week and the panic attacks are gone and the terrible vibrating has only come very minor back last week for some hours. I am looking forward to see them gone too. I had for years pain in the stomach like a little burning sensation or like someone pressing a thump into my stomach just under the navel. This is totally gone now. For 3 days I am pain free with the stomach. For two days now I don’t have this dizziness I had for a very long time. I am very positive and I hope that if I would get all the stuff you get your hands on in the states I would heal much faster. But at least we have tons of Swedes here the famous kålrot!!! 😉 Thank you Able and Raster for making this Forum live, informative and fun to visit. yours Thomas"

Trying to figure out if they’re even candida related at this point or not. I will admit that I still eat quite a bit of meat, chicken, turkey and fish that is not organic so that’s probably my problem. I keep losing weight and feel I have to eat something."

I know you didn’t address this to me, and I’m sure Thomas will answer you. But if you’re still eating meat every day, then this could very well be the cause of your stomach problems. When meat proteins break down, they release ammonia which can irritate an already irritated stomach and intestines. The Candida also release ammonia which is added to the ammonia that the meat produces during its break-down, so if you’re eating meat 1 to 3 times a day, the fact that you and the Candida both are causing ammonia in your system means that the liver is being constantly overworked, again, not to mention the irritation of the stomach and intestines. In addition to the protein break-down, the non-organic meats eaten every day contain antibiotics which are destroying the beneficial bacteria in the intestines on daily basis. This alone will prevent a Candida cure. If you don’t cut the meat from your diet, you can expect the stomach problems to continue as well as not being able to completely cure your Candida infestation. Your cure is about choices that you make every day, nothing more. Able"
10,89Mirageman,387,"Thanks for the info Able, I kinda figured that but I guess I was in denial because I have started feeling a little better. I was already on the candida diet and taking the anti-fungals/supplements before I ever found this site. I know for a fact that I already experienced some die off effects such as itching and fatigue. Would you recommend that I start over with the cleanse that you mention here on the forum and start from scratch or just cut out all meat for the next month and see what happens? I do want to get this under control for sure and I am willing to do whatever it takes."
11,Thomas,387,"Hi, Well, I am sticking to the diet to the point, not breaking an inch.  If I eat meat then only some wild salmon at the moment and some white fish. Only fish which are caught in the ocean and not from fish farms.  I mainly eat organic eggs for protein and avocado.  But I believe I only have twice a week some fish. Until now I didn’t have any chicken yet. We don’t get organic ones where I live so I stick with the fish. PS.

As I cant get them here without alcohol I bought only the herbs and make myself a bitter tasting tea from it. I get that one down, and it feels good in the stomach.

0,c.winters,388,"My Story Hey guys, after reading this forum for a week or two thought it would be a good place to share my story and document my progress. Background: The usual, doctors prescribing me anti anxiety, add, depression etc pills my whole life. Recently found out I am have reactive hypoglycemia, adrenal glands are burnt out and very large possibility that I have Candida. Started hypoclycemic diet which quickly transitioned to candida diet (they are very similar)Binge drank and smoked on weekends (cold turkey for 3 weeks so far, and relied heavily on sugary foods my whole life to cover up emotions. Have also been on antibiotics for extended periods of time because of acne. At the point where it’s too painful not to make some changes! I’m two weeks into the diet at the moment, there have been lost of ups and downs (mostly down), 3:28 am right now and can’t sleep.. decided to take a couple extra drops of oregano oil tonight, big mistake 🙂 Diet: Mostly Veggies (organic if possible) Fish or chicken every day or two Eggs! Coconut oil, Oilive Oil Lots of herbs and spices  Coconut flour, stevia, protein powder (some days) Supplements: Multivitamin Probiotic Vitamin D Chromium (regulates blood sugar for hypo) Fish oil Plan on getting: Digestive enzyme molybdenum (if i can find it) Anti-fungals: Oil of Oregano (for the first 2-3 weeks) Any suggestions on the diet or supplements? How did your first two weeks go?"

4,Able900,388,"Taking individual enzymes, whether a few or many, will cause the body’s own production of these enzymes to simply stop producing with continued use, at which point your body will continuously be dependent on artificial means of digesting all of the food you eat. But the biggest problem is the enzyme cellulase in particular because it is not a normal enzyme produced by the human body. In addition, cellulase breaks down the fibers in vegetables into simple sugars, and when breaking down the cellulase in the Candida cell walls only a small portion of the Candida cells can be destroyed by these enzymes. The resulting sugars will simply feed the surviving Candida allowing them to grow and multiply. You need to purchase digestive bitters which will allow the body to make its own enzymes as they are needed. Read the following post for more information. http://www.thecandidadiet.com/forum/yaf_postst1111_Digestive-Bitters.aspx Do you have New Chapter Every Man Multivitamin? If not, please send a link to the one you have. But if you do have this one, it contains fermented soy as well as gum acacia which is a sugar.

0,anniroC:,390,"Hello, I believe I have had candida for more then 20 years.  I have actually been diagnosed three different times.  First time in 1989. I was just a younster then… all of 22 years old.  I was to caught up in my young life… and didnt understand the gravity of the depths this disease would take me. Second time was many years later… 2005. I was having allergy issues and a co-worker told me about her Dad that was a naturalpath. (sp?)  I went to see this guy and he told me then that I had candida…  That time I wasn’t ready to hear it again. I did buy some of the supplements and fake started the cleanse. I tried half heartidly several times to “cleanse”.  Now fast forward to now. For the past three years… I have had multiple failing health issues. Almost everything on the list and more for candida. I was insneard in Western Med world and had Dr.’s opinions coming from every direction. Several very expensive “test” to find out that “nothing was wrong-except-this-or-that-overweight-blah-blah-blah” Take these meds… and go away. I didn’t feel listened to and patronized a lot of the time. One such doctor told me the reason I was having pain in my stomach was because I was to fat and it was squishing everything inside. Nice. For the record I am overweight and have been for most of my life. 5.1 250 lbs. I was told the discoloration on my skin and skin tags were “just part of the ageing process”. This time… the way I found out I had candida was- My family had taken a camping trip. Glorious time out with nature. Which was a good time… When we arrived home and upon showering my body started itching and broke out in hives from head to toe. Thinking it was probably another “allergy” of something I came in contact with… I went off to store to get some medicaited “anti-itch” spray. Which I found. As I was leaving the store… It came to me that this was Yeast. One thing led to another… I find myself back in the Naturalpath’s office where I had been six year previous. With in 10 minutes. He told me exactly what I had and this time I was ready to listen… hear it and really do something about it… or really I had no choice. I was sick. I staggered into his office. I felt like I was wasted. The next 4 days that followed I thought I was going to die. I layed in bed for HOURS holding my head… every nerve ending felt like it was raw. I had a wierd humming noise in my head. It was awful. I ate the foods allowed ONLY. I am on day 8 today. I had a crappy day today. The 6th day has been the best. I felt lighter. In addition to the candida I also have a parasite infestation in my liver. That is another story in itself… yet yeast and parasites go together quite well from what I have read. The last 8 days have changed my life… I am scared of what the future holds. If this cleanse and eating this way cures things for me… I will believe God has personally handed me my own personal miracle. Any advise, inspiration, & thoughts are welcome.  C:"
1,raster,390,"Sounds like you are on the right path. Once done with candida diet, I would not go back to certain bad foods such as sweets, diet soda, anything with aspartame, food coloring, etc. Limit your coffee and get more exercise. You can turn yourself around and cure some/many of your health problems."

3,yes178,390,Ive also been battling Candida for awhile. No way at the level you are. Ive noticed a huge difference with taking the probiotics (i take sustenex every day a chewable probiotic) I also drink 4oz of aloe vera juice every day. (i use georges aloe vera its filterd and tastes like water-no cramping-) The combination of the two was a HUGE HELP to me just my opinion these two things really helped me.
0,Gadget,391,"I have recently been on the candidas diet where I cut everything out except vegetables chicken, eggs, lemons, brown rice,quinoa, millet, almond butter, and I am out of options what else to do for myself to fix what’s going on internally as I can no longer make any descisions for myself and have to guess at everything I do and all my doctors cannot give me any help as I had to figure out my own problems myself. If I could just get the brain fog to lift so I could think for myself and drive again so I did not have to rely on the bus I would be in a lot better shape. But I also would like to know how to put my weight back on with this new diet because even with trying to get 5 meals in a day for 2000 calories the weight is just falling off as my wife wants me admitted to the hospital and I told her there’s nothing they are going to do and it’s all up to me that is why I bought this program but the brain fog being the worse it’s ever been and the anorexia is not getting me any better. Help please, Gadget God bless everyone on this forum"
1,Able900,391,"Hello, Gadget. Your brain fog is coming from both the Candida and the die-off toxins released by the Candida as they perish because of the diet, which is of course what you want. And I know how horrible all of the die-off symptoms can be, but there is help. Look for a product called Molybdenum, this is a natural trace element already found in the human body. Try to find it in pill form, 250 mcg in each if you can. Start with one pill after breakfast and one after your last meal of the day. The next day you can raise the dose to one after each meal and continue with that dosage. Another useful product is called Candidate by Native Remedies, this helps with brain-fog, headaches, etc. You can take this three times a day or as needed since it works on a immediate basis, so you don’t need to keep it in your bloodstream, you can take it when begin to feel a die-off reaction approaching. But for the time being I would take it three times a day to get rid of the present brain fog. As far as what you should and should not eat is concerned, you need to stop eating brown rice, quinoa, millet, almond butter since you’re still new on the diet. You can add them gradually at a later time during the diet. You can add organic buckwheat in place of those items, Amazon has this.  What you can eat a lot of is: All the green fresh vegetables you can eat. If you can’t find lots of fresh ones, you can purchase frozen vegetables. In addition, as often as possible you should eat avocados, organic eggs, baked rutabaga, turnips, green beans (and all other green vegetables), and bread that is made from coconut flour. The recipe for the bread is in the “Recipes” section of the forum. You can also find a lot of other recipes there that will help you increase the items on your diet as well. By the way, don’t eat the rutabaga the first few times you have it as it’s one of the strongest antifungals you’ll use and can create terrible die-off toxins. Also, you should be taking the Molybdenum and Candidate before you eat this. Three days after you change your diet, purchase some organic coconut oil and take three teaspoons a day, one after each meal. You should raise that amount to four teaspoons after two days and continue with that dosage for at least 7 to 10 days. Be sure that you are taking the Molybdenum and Candidate at least three days “before” you start the coconut oil, otherwise it can make you very sick as well as making the brain fog worse because it’s a powerful antifungal that will kill thousands of Candida in your body, thus releasing more toxins. A few questions if I may: How long have you been on the particular diet you’re on? How long have you suffered from Candida symptoms? Are you taking any supplements at all at this time? If so, what are they? After you’ve added the things I’ve named, post your update on the forum and we’ll talk about the next step. Meanwhile, if you have questions or have a concern about anything, please let us know. Able"
0,Horreur,392,"hi. i’m a female in my early 20s. so, it goes like this: i started having sex when i was 15. everything was cool. around the age of 19, i did not have sex at all for an entire year. after a year, when i finally did, BOOM. yeast infection. a yeast infection every single time i have sex. this has been going on for 4-5 years now. every. single. time. on average, i probably have four a month. i’ve tried everything. monistat, garlic, tea tree oil…none of it works. my tolerance for diflucan now is borderline non-existant. i’ve also tried everything to make the infections stop coming. i’ve narrowed down all the options, and i KNOW it’s sex. i’ve also read that being on birth control pills for 3+ months isn’t good either. ha. i was on them for 8 years. i found out about candidiatis, and it seems like it’s my problem. i have always maintained a fairly healthy diet, but i do eat plenty of bananas, bread, and cheese. i have had problems with depression and anxiety all my life, but definitely now more than ever. my brain does feel clogged a lot of the times. i just started the candida cleanse today. i’m about to have my first liver flush and go to bed. i reallyyyyy hope this takes care of my chronic yeast infections. has anybody else had this problem? did the cleanse fix it? i want to be normal again!"
1,Able900,392,"Horreur wrote: has anybody else had this problem? did the cleanse fix it? i want to be normal again! The cleanse alone won’t ‘fix’ a Candida infestation any more than kicking a flat tire will repair it. You’ll need to go on the strict Candida diet and eventually start the antifungals and probiotics. In addition, once you’ve started the cycle of contracting a Candida/yeast vaginal infection every time you have unprotected sex, the cycle won’t end until you’ve taken care of the real problem, and of course that’s using protection. The vagina is more acidic than alkaline, but semen is more alkaline. If you’re continually on the borderline of a yeast infection, the addition of an alkaline environment to the vagina is all that it takes to set off the infection again. If you’ve started using protection now, that’s the first step. So all you’ll need to do now is the cleanse and then complete the diet’s various stages. Until you’ve done this, Candida will remain in your system. Able"
2,Pina,392,"I haven’t tried any of this, but some people have had some improvements: I’ve read people tried douching with garlic water or leaving a garlic clove inside (tie a string around it so you can pull it out), or using a tampon dipped in coconut oil. Don’t wear tights or pantyhose. Wear only cotton underwear. Don’t wear tight jeans, pants or leggings. I would quit BC if you are still on it at as well. If you are having unprotected sex, you can pass candida to your partner and for as long as you’re with this person, it will be harder to fight this fungus. All of the above is helpful, but going on the candida diet is what will really help you. Good luck!"
0,gonznj2001,393,"I’m trying to figure out what to do next. This is where my candida journey has taken me… Over the summer I was feeling horrible- fatigued, sweating profusely, bloated, foggy brain, irregular period, was running but could not seem to loose weight or feel healthy, dry eyes, headaches, and the list goes on. I thought it was my thyroid so I cut most carbs, white sugar, diet coke, etc out of my diet while I found a dr to see. I found an md that practices hollistic medicine and had to wait 3 weeks to see him. So I was on a very low carb diet for 3 weeks by the time I saw him. Once I saw the dr he put me on a diet but didn’t mention candida. I was very overwhelmed and have never been one to take medicines so he decided to take a conservative approach however he did not sugar coat it and it scared the crap out of me. These are the things I am doing: I am taking 3 tsp of coconut oil a day, a digestive enyzme 2x day, drainage drops 5 drops 2x day, chaste tree am, warm water with lemon mostly in the morning, minced garlic in salads. He suggested a master cleanse- but I am not open to that right now. Told me to incorporate ginger, cayenne pepper, and cinammon into my diet. Luckily a friend asked if the dr mentioned candida because the diet seemed to be a candida diet. I found this site and it has been extremely helpful. I’m buying organic produce, organic/free range meats, organic eggs, etc. And this is what I’m eating right now:  Breakfast: eggs with tomatoes and avocodoes, eggs with spinach, or greek yogurt with walnuts (soaked) or almonds and sometimes berries. Snack/ Lunch: raw nuts, celery sticks with cream cheese, sometimes quinoa crackers with guacamole, butter, or hummus. I miss the crunch so the quinoa crackers satisfy that need. Also zucchini soup, sometimes eggs similar to breakfast, or the chicken quinoa salad. Sometimes I have a spoon of cottage cheese. Dinner: lean meats, veggies i.e. eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, salads with raw garlic, shallots, and quinoa and assorted veggies and garbanzo beans. And I am having a hard time with all of the raw garlic, shallots, and onions that I am eating. I feel like the taste comes up from my stomach into my mouth so my weakness is a square of 82% dark chocolate. About a week ago I felt horrible- extremely fatigued and broke out from one day to the next. I followed some of the indications for the die off and things seemed to stabilize. I feel a lot better than I did during the summer but not 100%. The sweating which to me was the worst symptom is much better and while my priority was feeling well I’ve also lost weight and don’t feel bloated. So I feel like what I’m doing is working. But I have to admit that I’m afraid of not feeling well again and I’m not sure what to do next. I just got the results of my bloodwork and everything was normal so nothing underlying that is causing my symptoms. I buy the whole foods organic yogurt with probiotics. But I’m wondering if I need something more or what else I should be doing. Thanks, Sandra"
1,Able900,393,"Hello, Sandra. It doesn’t matter that you’re eating only dark chocolate instead of regular; you’re still feeding the Candida every time you eat this. If you’ll cut out the cream cheese as well as the cottage cheese you’re more likely to eventually see an improvement as both of these are feeding the Candida. As long as you’re killing and feeding the Candida both, you will not see a permanent cure, but only continue the cycle. What type of guacamole, butter and humus are you eating? As far as the doctor’s suggestion for a master cleanse is concerned, the diet would be a form of cleanse if you would clean it up a bit, but not as it is at this time. If the garlic, shallots, and onions are bothering you, you can easily remove either the shallots or onions completely without a problem. Instead of using dark chocolate to remedy this try a product by the name of Digestive Grape Bitters as it will be a lot healthier than the dark chocolate, especially at this time. If you decide to purchase the bitters, let me know and I’ll let you know how to use them. If you’ll let me know the names of the digestive enzyme and drainage drops you’re on I’ll check these out. Even though a doctor recommended these, believe it or not, quite often there are factors involved with the products which they overlook. From your post I take it that you’ve read about Molybdenum and Candidate being useful for the die-off symptoms. Correct? Did the doctor not suggest that you take a probiotic? Able"
2,gonznj2001,393,"Thank you so much for replying. I will eliminate the cream cheese and cottage cheese. I make the guacamole with avocados, cilantro, salt, and lime juice. I make the hummus with organic chick peas, garlic, olive oil, and tahini. I’m using kerrygold butter. I will look into digestive grape bitters. I am taking the Medicine’s name complete nutritional enzyme- 1 am and 1 in pm on empty stomach. And energetix drainage tone. I did read some posts about the die off but the names you referenced do not look familiar. I will look at those too. The dr did not suggest taking a probiotic. I left the dr’s knowing that my body was full of toxins, that my body was holding on to stress, that I should start with the diet and supplements, and await the bloodwork results to see if there was something underlying causing my symptoms. I do have to go back but it takes weeks to get an appt. Thanks, Sandra"
3,Able900,393,"Hi, Sandra. Kerrygold Butter is a dairy product as it contains pasteurized cream which is feeding the Candida whenever you eat it. If you really need to use a type of butter, a product called “ghee” is the only safe type. It’s much, much stronger than regular butter, so you don’t need to use near as much, but it’s also much more expensive. If you stop using butter altogether, you’ll find that in time you don’t miss it at all. If you’re using regular table salt, check the ingredients, it probably contains either damaging additives and/or Dextrose. Dextrose is a sugar which feeds the Candida. Purchase pure Himalayan sea salt which contains nothing but pure pink salt (because it’s unprocessed it retains the pink color of the sea rocks from which it’s taken as well as all the minerals we need for health). I still don’t know what type of enzymes you’re taking. “Medicine’s name complete nutritional enzyme” produced dozens of brand choices on Google. Is there a particular brand name? The Energetix Drainage Tone is a homeopathic remedy which I see no problem with, but I really have little knowledge on homeopathic medicine as I believe it normally works much too slowly for logical use. Exactly how long have you been on the diet you named? Actually, you weren’t really lowering the number of Candida in your body a great deal as you were feeding them at the same time. I completely understand that you do not wish to take ‘medicine’ so please realize that I never recommend medicines as they’re described. I had much rather recommend a natural product which can do the same as a medicine and often obtain a better and quicker positive reaction. I stated that so that you will understand when I say that neither Molybdenum nor Candidate are actually “medicines.” Molybdenum is a natural trace mineral which is naturally found in the human body, and Candidate is purely a mixture of herbs. If you decide to take only one of these, definitely take the Molybdenum as it will also protect the liver from dangerous Candida toxins. Able"
4,gonznj2001,393,"I appreciate all of your insight. I will give ghee a try. I just checked my salt and when I thought my symptoms were thyroid related, I switched to an iodized sea salt. So I will make sure to get the himalayan sea salt. I might have had a typo. It’s The Medicine Man’s nutritional supplement: Complete nutritional enzymes. Formerly Complete Nutrients for digestion. Contains pancreatic enzymes, papaya enzyme, pineapple enzyme, and curcuma longa (root) extract. I’ve been on this diet for three weeks. I am going to try Molybdenum. While some symptons have improved dramatically I still have brain fog and I read that it could help with that. Thanks, Sandra"
5,raster,393,"I once was at this point and just gotta say keep up the diet. Give it 1-2 more months and it’ll do wonders. I personally had a bad leaky gut reaction to the quinoa; so this may have to be removed as well. It is technically a grain and still has low amounts of gluten. I recommend trying to replace it with buckwheat, which is a little bit healthier in my opinion. Save the quinoa for phase 2 of the diet. Switch the salt…good idea. Anything with salt added to it (such as roasted sunflower seeds) isn’t healthy either. Just get the raw ones. Maybe cut the almonds and save for phase 2…its up to you. As far as the doctor…I recommend visiting a naturopathic doctor if you haven’t done so already. He may possibly suggest some (different) homiopathic enzymes that will help like the grape bitters. I feel that homiopathics do work…so I would continue to take it. Also leave any beef or pork out of your diet if you haven’t already done so. Relating to the fatigue…your adrenals are completely drained, so you will need a good b-vitamin to help heal you. If you are drinking any coffeee..stop it immediately because it doesn’t help. Get more exercise to build these adrenals up. The bloodwork won’t show much information at all. They will never be able to properly diagnose candida, and it’ll take many tests and specialists (expense) to figure this out and they may even find you to be normal."

Sandra;  Concerning Raster’s statements above, please disregard everything other than the coffee suggestion. First of all no one knows whether or not your adrenal glands are ‘drained’ as he seems to be so sure of. In fact, since you say that the die-off protocol stabilized the fatigue, it was almost certain to be caused by die-off rather than completely drained adrenals. As far as his statement, “Get more exercise to build these adrenals up” is concerned, please ignore this statement as well. Only a healthy diet and the correct supplements will do that job. In fact, taking strenuous exercise is advised against since it only aggravates the fatigue as well as drained or low adrenal glands. Although a very mild type of exercise may not hurt, rest works ten times better in the case of drained adrenals. As far as The Medicine Man’s Enzymes (Amylase + Lipase + Proteolase) are concerned, if you get the Digestive Grape Bitters you won’t need that product. Taking pure enzymes such as those simply teaches the body that you do not need its help in producing natural enzymes since they’re being supplied from elsewhere. In time, your digestive system will depend on you to always supply enzymes so that your body can digest the food you eat. Digestive Grape Bitters do not do this as they simply stimulate the proper functions of the body so that it can supply the needed enzymes in the correct amounts at any given time. Grape Bitters have other uses as well; they generally improve the micro-environment of the digestive system from the stomach to the large intestine.  Bile flow is increased reducing the incidence of gallbladder disease and improving the self-cleansing action of the liver.  Grape Bitters also stimulate the repair of the intestinal-wall lining caused by Leaky Gut Syndrome and Candida in general. Able"
7,gonznj2001,393,"Raster- thank you for the encouragement to keep at the diet and it helps knowing that it does get better. I realize that everyone’s experiences are different so I appreciate you taking the time to share yours. Able- I was was running and doing p90x and was told to scale down on exercising and to do nothing more than a walk each day so I concur that doing strenous exercise for me right now is not the answer. I am going to look to switch to grape bitters. Thank you for all the information. I am going to implement some of the changes recommended. So grateful I found this site. Thanks, Sandra"
8,SamanthaB,393,"Before I go off on one, I’ll start by saying that I think I have a candida issue but have not managed to complete the diet yet as it’s do darn hard and the last time I got the most terrible die off symptoms which left me only just able to go to work everyday! From what I have read (which is loads now), I think you are doing tremendously well and well done for finding a solution so soon. When I first started feeling ill I turned to sugar to perk me up so I made it a million times worse for myself! I agree with all of the information about the dairy, equally caffeine is generally a no no. Anything with sugar replacements is also a no go so the 2 above pretty much rule out that dark chocolate. The way I think of it is that if you are substituting a normal food with something else, usually you still can’t have it. Stick to the things that are definitely fine in terms of your salad, etc. Some people suggest garlic tablets…have you tried these instead of so much raw garlic? Might slow you down a bit but is more socially acceptable and might make it easier to stick to. You are doing so well so make sure you do push on and get all the way back to better, it’s very easy to think you will never feel well again but I have read loads of accounts of full recoveries now so it is definitely possible. Check out my blog, it will show you how well you are doing compared to a lot of us out there: http://candidafree.wordpress.com/ (if this blocks the link, it’s called Candida Free and is on WordPress)."
9,raster,393,"As far as the exercise comment; I did not mean strenuous exercise, but just what you can handle (walks are a perfect way to get exercise). If you wear yourself down too much, it won’t really help. On a side note: Plenty rest is definitely the best thing you need to fight candida. You may need as much as 8-9 hours to heal properly on the diet. Don’t short change your sleep! This will go a long ways to get your body more daily energy."
10,gonznj2001,393,Thanks Samantha B- I will check out your blog. Thanks raster- my inclination was definitely to work out harder and it’s been an adjustment to have to slow down. I appreciate your feedback.
0,christina miick,394,"Hello, 12 years ago I had a kidney transplant and I take prednisone every day. I have experienced candida symptoms including vaginal infections and skin rashes for years. The problem is I am bery limited on what I can use/take and even what is ok to eat, due to protecting my kidney and or the meds i take for my kidney. I wondered if anyone else was in the boat and had some advice?"
1,Able900,394,"Hello, Christina, and welcome to the forum. Patients have to go through so many rounds of antibiotics during and following transplants it’s really no surprise you’re suffering from Candida. You will of course check with your nephrologist before trying anything that I or anyone else may suggest considering the treatment and interactions with your medicines. You can look at the Candida diet on the site yourself to see which items you can eat. I imagine that you shouldn’t have a problem with the diet actually since it’s a fairly clean diet and is geared towards cleansing the body in general. Beef is listed as one of the initial food items, but I suggest that readers leave it out of the diet for at least two to four weeks depending on their infestation. Among other factors, this is because of the ammonia gases that are released during the breakdown and digestion of red meat protein. The ammonia will only make it more difficult to detox the liver if you are adding ammonia to its workload every day. If you eat eggs, I would try to make organic eggs my main source of protein for at least two weeks. Chicken and fish eaten occasionally should be fine, but again, just don’t overdo it with these proteins. As far as an antifungal is concerned, I would imagine that a good probiotic is certainly one that you’d have no problems with. I remember a research study conducted in Sweden in 2010 which concerned a medication for kidney transplant patients called myycophenolate mofetil. You probably already know that immunosuppressants such as this one often cause diarrhea because of altering the microbiota population of the intestines. At any rate, two groups of patients were chosen for the study before their surgeries, one group was given a high dosage of probiotics and the other group a placebo, they continued the probiotic and placebo for four months following their surgeries. The probiotic group was given a total of 100 billion beneficial bacteria a day. In the end, there was a 71% reduction of expected diarrhea in the patients given the probiotic, but the other group suffered the average percentage of diarrhea for the number of patients studied. So if you do decide to try the treatment, I would definitely suggest the probiotic as your first supplement. Good luck to you. Please keep us posted as to your decision and progress.  Able"

0,tttom,395,"Heya I’m 17 (18 in july) I’ve had systemic candida for around 4 years now and can’t really remember what it feels like to not have multiples of problems. I have so many symptoms such as acne, severely bad blood circulation (my hands will still turn purple from being cold even in 20 degrees celsius) yeast infections, depression, anxiety, dandruff and generally just feeling aweful etc the list just goes on and on and they are all constant. After not getting any help from doctors ”it’s all the in the head” (haha) I decided to go on a no sugar diet by using information of the internet, I spent a lot of money on products such as threelac, ginger, GSE and oil of oregano with no luck. After 5 months i wasn’t feeling any better/ getting any good nutrition and just started feeling worse and worse until my parents decided i needed to see a nutritionist (which is costing hundreds of pounds) I’ve been on a much healthier candida diet now for the last month and a half which incorporates a lot of vitamins etc as well as anti fungals. Despite this i still keep getting these negative feelings that i’m never going to get better. My life is like living in a nightmare, i get no pleasure out of it whatsoever anymore, everyone around me is going out, partying/clubbing, carefree as to what they eat and drink and i just stay home all the time now and barely see my friends as i don’t feel comfortable going out. I used to love skateboarding but due to my blood circulation plus other symptoms i can’t enjoy it anymore. I haven’t had a girlfriend for over 3 years now as i have a yeast infection and i just don’t feel comfortable in my own company let alone with another person. I don’t feel like i can join in and have fun like everyone else everything has to be so serious and strict i feel completely alienated. I’m going to university in september and i’m so worried that i won’t get better for then and also that the majority of people will be drinking like crazy and eating really unhealthy i just can’t imagine that i could live like that. Has anyone successfully got rid of a deep rooted candida? if so how long did it take you? Thanks Tom"
1,June,395,"I’ve been following the forums for a bit now. I’m seeing a Naturopath and have been following a candida diet for about 7 weeks now and am feeling much, much better. And yes, I know someone who had a severe candida infection (including 2 hospitalizations and her weight went under 100 lbs). It took her about a year and a half with help from a naturopath and not cheating on her diet and she is well and healthy and eats normally. This was 20 years ago and I know there is much more information available now. So get as much help and information as you can and don’t cheat on your diet (I think this is a huge part of recovery)."
2,tttom,395," That’s good to hear that you’re feeling better 🙂 I think it’s just that it’s such a long process sometimes i get anxious to whether i’m actually getting anywhere, it’s great to hear success stories like that, gives me hope, i’m surprised she can eat normally and hasn’t got symptoms again (which is great though!) Thank you"
3,codylee,395,"hi tom, i just wanted to say that i know exactly what you are going through. im 2o and the last 3 years have been frustrating for me also – i get the skin rashes/ problems and alot of the time, just dont feel ‘right’ or feel yuk & bloated after eating certain foods. going out with friends to eat out is certainly frustrating when you cant just eat ‘normally’ hey . my biggest thing is staying motivated – im hopeless- ive attempted a number of times to do the diet, and always end up back at square 1. reading this website has inspired me to give it another go and blast it.good luck and i hope you can too. cody"
4,sue27uk,395,"I have just read this Tom and am really sorry to hear you are suffering like this. I am 27, and have had thrush for 5 months so can’t imagine what it must be like for years. I also have a fissure and IBS which is all causing me major problems. I have been to a dietician who has helped me with the IBS so I hope your new diet helps aswell. Are you using any treatments from the doctor? I am on a course of tablets which help ease the symptoms. Have you told your parents how you are feeling? They seem to be very supportive which is great. I think you should, or your doctor. I know how lowering constant health issues can be and am currently undergoing counselling which is helping me, maybe talking to someone may help. With regard to the thrush, have you tried taking a probiotic capsule? You can get them from Holland and Barrett – acidophilus has helped me (until I had to start on the antibiotics again!). Good luck, I really hope you get the help you need 🙂"
5,raster,395,"It can take as long as 6-18 months to completely cure candida and if you want to heal faster, I recommend visiting a naturopathic doctor who will put you on better supplements that will help you heal in weeks instead of months. Give the diet a few more months and you’ll really see the difference."

0,BoJo,397,"Hello, my name is ‘BoJo’. I am a 24 year old female that has been on the Candida Diet for about 2-1/2 months. I started this life changing diet all because of information I have received from a friend and continuous yeast infections that did not go away no matter what I tried. It started with a couple of friends planning on taking a trip to North Dakota for a friends graduation. So I contacted my friend to see if she still wanted to take the long road trip to a fun filled weekend. Her response was that she was down to go except she was not going to drink with us. My first thought on this was “Well that’s lame. If my friend is not going to want to party with me then I’ll be the only drunk one. That’s no fun.” So we decided not to go for several reasons, not just the reason that she can not drink. I asked her over several weeks why she can not drink because every time us girls get together we all seem to have quite a few beverages and try to have some adventure to go on :). She did not really answer me to why she was on it other then she had an overgrowth of yeast in her body. To me that did not really make a whole lot of sense and I am the type of person that will ask several questions to understand how, what, and why things are what they are and she was not really answering my questions. So over these several months of trying to get out of her what this diet was that she was on I was finally got the answers I was looking for. She started to tell me her story (I would love to tell her story because hers is far more interesting than mine but it is not my place so I will let her do that if she decides to do so)and all her symptoms where before she started it and she kind of “self-diagnosed” her self . So of course I continued to badger her and ask questions because everything that she had I seemed to have. She was telling me what Candida does to the body and why my body is acting the way it is acting. After hearing all this “shocking” news about what may possibly be doing this to my unhealthy life style I started the diet the very next day. I totally went cold turkey as best as I could but man am I glad I did it that way. I feel that if I would have ‘weened’ myself off of ‘regular’ food then I probably would not have done it at all. I love food way too much to want to cut anything out. Overall, I did not feel that my lifestyle was unhealthy. I was very cautious of what I ate due to the fact that I have educated my self on nutrition but I must not have been doing as good of a job as I thought I was doing. I later found out that I was not eating healthy at all and I was starting to let myself go in many ways not just what I was consuming. This diet has been life changing! I am very aware of what certain foods do to my body. What others are harmful and some that are very beneficial. The symptoms that have cleared up so far is my acne for the most part. I still have some and I think that is because my candida isn’t completely gone. I used to be extremely gassy and now I am not as much. I’ve realized that was because of the foods I have eaten. If I do seem to burp a lot after a meal, I do not eat that food item any more. One food that I can not eat that I used to eat a lot of was soy. My body does NOT like soy. The only symptom that I seem to not be able to get rid of is my yeast infections but I think the longer I am on it that too will go away :). REALIZATION: One thing that I have realized about this diet is that it is different for EVERYONE. Some people can tolerate different foods while others can not. Experimenting is kind of the key to all of this. On what supplements seem to work and what foods bother you and which ones do not. I have come to find out that supplements are key (even though I tend to not take them everyday). The supplements that I use are by a brand called Nature’s Sunshine. I use herbal medicines and have for over ten years and will the rest of my life. This diet has increased my dislike for modern medicine due so many negative effects on the human body. Exercise is also very important (yes, I stack on that some times as well.) I try to keep it interesting because I get bored of things very easily and tend to quite. I have started getting several health magazines that recommend several work outs for the month so that helps with the consistent change of pace. There are days to where I want too have that slice of pizza that my boyfriend’s roommate ordered, so I cave and I have one. Later I realize why I don’t eat that way any more but that is why I do not mind so much that I cave. I have heard over and over again that it will set me back but the thing is that I personally need a reminder every now and then other wise I tend to loose sit of the bigger picture. I also plan on eating this way the rest of my life. This is a continues process and I am glad I am in this process. I convinced my boyfriend to do it was well and he is starting to have the die off symptoms right not but has already lost five pounds after only being on it for a couple of weeks. There is much more that I can put into this forum but maybe that will be for a different day. Thank you, BoJo This is the website to the products I use if anyone else wants it: http://www.naturessunshine.com/us/products/a-z/default.aspx *I plan on posting some recipes in the food forum. When I started this that was one thing I struggled with was I could not find or think of anything to eat."

1,whyitsme,398,"yes xylitol or setvia are allowed as sweeteners. As hard as diet is, it does get easier the longer you do it. You get used to only shopping on the outside of the store. But you also appreciate how much healthier you are and how much better you feel (once you get past the die off stage that is) Once you have it under control.I’d give it a few months, as well as make sure to make necessary changes elsewhere,( ie: such as adding probiotics) a small cheat is allowed in my book as long as you maintain the diet the rest of the time. Meaning only a few bites of one of your items not all of them. (a glass of wine, or a piece of pizza or a few balls). It is easier to actually have no sweets though, if your will power is in question. I usually also take a extra probiotic if I do a slight cheat just in case. However I have found that once you are clean, you must maintain diet about 98-99% of the time. Or risk it comign back. good luck!"

0,Alby1970,399,"I have had all sorts of symptoms for years. Three years ago I started the cleanse/diet and did amazingly…for a while. I had horrible die off at the beginning but they went away after a week or so. I remember looking in the mirror and seeing my skin look better than it had in forever and my red (sunburn looking) chest was perfectly normal. I was thrilled. Then, I did something really really stupid. I got Botox injections. The toxins must have overloaded my system because two days later I got shingles! I went off the diet and was worried about going back on it because the shingles really freaked me out. My symptoms slowly got worse over the past three years. The last year has been really stressful (getting divorced) and I just haven’t had the motivation to do the cleanse/diet. I’ve also been on an all carbs all the time diet and eating more sugar than I ever have. I’ve never been a big sugar eater but, for me, having an ice cream cone or a candy bar every day is a huge change. I joined because I am going to start Monday and I need help with my resolve and with staying motivated."
1,Able900,399,"Hello, Alby. Curing the Candida infestation means that you take antifungals to kill the fungi, and you stay strictly on the diet in order to avoid the cycle of killing and then rebuilding the infestation continuously. It can turn into a never-ending treatment as you can see. Staying with the treatment is really all about two choices, and the choices are;  which would you prefer to live with for the remainder of your life, the candy bar and the Candida infestation, or leaving the candy bar alone and being healthy and free of the suffering you’ve been experiencing? Think about those choices when you see a candy bar or think about an ice cream cone. Able"
0,Rockinbetty,400,"If you have done the cleanse, either option 2 or 3 will you share your experience with it? I just bought everything for the Detox Drink and Liver Flush and I’m a mix of anxious nerves, haha. I was really hoping to have started it last week with the holiday time off of work, but wasn’t able to… so part of the cleanse will take place while at work, sigh.. ha… oh well"
1,Sunshine,400,"Hi Rocki I have just started the cleanse 4 days ago, I am in my fourth day. I started option 2 but after two days, that is on day three I felt terribly lethargic and I just could not go on with it any longer. However, I had only wanted to do option 2 for four days, as I feel when I go to work it will be too hard to follow. So yesterday I went shopping and bought myself vegies and salad greens and made myself a salad and steamed vegies. I ate it all and afterwards started feeling much better. I am therefore now doing the option 3 (with one meal a day) and that suits me just fine so far, tomorrow is the real test as I will have to go to work! The positive side, I had very bad flue when I started the fast and this might have also made it worse, but after two days of fast (day three) my flue felt better and today it seems almost gone. However, I ate lots of garlic and Olive leaf extract to combat the virus, knowing that it also combats the Candida. Hope this helps you! Sunshine"
2,Rockinbetty,400,yeah…. I’ve been going back and fourth on that… I think I will do option 3 as well. Thanks Sunshine! really appreciate your input (:
3,Rockinbetty,400,"I don’t know if this relates to your symptoms..but the first 2 days I was completely fine..but the morning of day 3, I collapsed when I got out of bed! I had those spots you see when u stand up too quickly, zero energy and short breath..immediately thought of my blood sugar level, so I made a pb & j sandwich and felt a little better…had to miss work, I couldn’t even stand up.. so granted, I only made 2 days on the cleanse..I’m bummed, but that reaction was scary as hell… has anyone else experienced that??"
4,Mo,400,"I’m on Day 5 of the Cleanse and I actually fainted on Day 3 at night cause I got up too fast, I didn’t panic and went on with the fasting cause it happened to me in the past (getting up too fast and fainting) without fasting. I do feel tired indeed but I noticed that the energy goes up and down. I’ve been slow running and sunbathing (in Rio de Janeiro!). Luckily I’m not working for the moment so it’s easier to do cause I wouldn’t be able to work in these conditions. Also, I’ve been focusing a lot on breathing exercises and introducing myself to meditation. My goal is to do the full 7-day cleanse."
5,Diane,400,"Hey Mo, Im on day 2 of the cleanse and like you I intend to do the full 7 day cleanse. However I am somewhat concerned because, so far I have had no bowel movement. To be truthful I was hoping that my intestines would react to the psyllum and bentonite. I do notice a difference for one thing my joint aches and pains have significantly reduced if not vanished so thats a plus. However I would really like to see all the yucky stuff go into the  toilet where it rightly belongs. Any suggestions Mo??? Thank you Diane from Malta living in the Netherlands"
6,iuperi,400,"I just found this site and I am so thankful! I dealt with a severe case of candida last year and thought, “Yeah I beat it!” NOT! Just a few weeks ago, I started having symptoms again. Besides the struggle with candida, I also have: gluten intolerance, lactose intolerance, insomnia, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, high blood pressure, polycystic ovary syndrome, sinus problems, pmdd, and anemia. I’m only 32! Since I went gfree 2 years ago, I seen a drastic improvement in my health. I know it doesn’t sound like it, but in 2008-2009 the pain was so bad I was in a wheelchair. Now I am going to start the cleanse and candida diet on Aug.1 (my bday is coming up and I would really like to enjoy some gfree cake first-hehe). I already started walking 2 months ago and worked on portion control. I’ve lost 20 pounds. So I’m looking forward to starting the program. Also I’m hoping that by getting the candida under control, it will affect my other medical issues. So look for updates;) Keeping fingers and toes crossed!"
7,tommequilts,400,"I’m on day 2 of the cleanse, option 2, and so far, so good except for one thing. I totally can’t stand the bentonite. Everything else is bearable for seven days, even the liver flush drink which had me quite worried. I’ve always been pretty intolerant to garlic and ginger, and was afraid it would set my gut on fire. To my surprise, it hasn’t – and the taste isn’t even horrible. (I mean, not something I would choose on my own, but definitely tolerable for seven days.) I’m nearing the end of day 2 and I’m feeling a little light-headed, so I’m going to watch myself carefully. First 2 days have been at work; now I’ll have the weekend; and then the last 3 days will be at work again. It really hasn’t been a problem to bring my drinks with me on the train. But I can’t believe how much my mind keeps turning toward food! I’ve never done a cleanse like this in my entire life, and really want to do the whole 7 days. Nice to have this forum for support."
0,Able900,401,"Hello, fellow forum readers. I recently read an interesting story on a blog by a gentleman who claimed that he had discovered the perfect ‘secret cure’ for Candida, and you would never guess what it was, to quote him; he said the secret he discovered was, “Suffering.” He continued to explain his ‘secret’ with the following information; he said that after literally years of suffering with the infestation he finally realized that he was simply going to have to respect the diet and follow it as he knew he should have all along. But instead of doing this from the beginning, he chose to fight the infestation with dozens of different antifungals and supplements, not to mention the hundreds of dollars he wasted during that time – but without completely following the diet. About three weeks ago, he said his suffering finally forced him to go on the diet 100%. So he did, and waited to see what would happen. As of Thursday, he said “amazingly” he’s experiencing fewer symptoms than he has in at least two years. So that’s why he says that literal “suffering” was the path to his cure. But what a path, right? It’s really not that amazing, and so simple, but it’s just too bad that he had to suffer needlessly for two years before believing what he had been told, that following the diet closely, and adding a few antifungals along with high counts of probiotics was the easiest and quickest way to destroy the infestation. Remember that the longer you wait to do exactly what is needed for your cure, the worse the infestation will become, and the worse it becomes, the longer your treatment period will take. Able"
1,Katy Gillett,401,"Hi Able, I might sound like a stuck record here but I do find sussing out all the things we can and can’t eat a little confusing. I hope you don’t mind I’m going to tell you a few of the things I’ve been eating that I think I may need to cut and could you possibly tell me if I’m right please? Quinoa Buckwheat Bread (currently making this with buckwheat flour, flaxseed meal, baking soda, cream of tartar, sea salt, coconut powder, eggs, olive oil and a dash of stevia) Oat cakes (ingredients are oatmeal, extra virgin olive oil, dulse sea vegetable, sodium bicarbonate, cracked black pepper, sea salt) Blueberries (small portions only a few times a week) Organic Greek yoghurt Sweet potato (About one a week) Brown lentils (protein for my salad about once to twice a week) I’ve been at this seven weeks and as you know my symptoms have not gone and I’m not feeling better in the slightest. I don’t think this is die off because it’s been around a week since I started one tablet of caprylic acid and though I did get worse, I don’t feel better. Hope you don’t mind me asking yet again. Just want to make absolutely sure that I’m not cutting things out that don’t need to me and making it unnecessarily hard for myself."
2,Able900,401,"Hello, Katy. Of course I don’t mind you asking about the food you’re eating. The foods you named are below along with my opinion about each. Quinoa: I would eat this only two or three times a week. Buckwheat: I see no problem with this. Bread (currently making with buckwheat flour, flaxseed meal, baking soda, cream of tartar, sea salt, coconut powder, eggs, olive oil and a dash of stevia)  No problems with the bread that I can see. Oat cakes (ingredients are oatmeal, extra virgin olive oil, dulse sea vegetable, sodium bicarbonate, cracked black pepper, sea salt) If the oat cakes contain regular oatmeal, you should leave this out of your diet. May I ask, do you make this yourself and if so, why do you add sodium bicarbonate? Blueberries (small portions only a few times a week) I know that I originally wrote that it should be alright to eat these a few times a week, but I would leave them completely out of the diet for the time being as blueberries do contain a simple sugar in the form of fructose. I’m sure others would disagree with me, but I’m only saying this because you’re still not seeing any real improvements. Organic Greek yoghurt: I see no problem with the yogurt. Sweet potato (About one a week); I would leave this out of the diet for the time being. Brown lentils (protein for my salad about once to twice a week);  If I’m correct, brown lentils are fairly low in carbs, if this is true, I see no problem with having them once or twice a week. You stated that you’re taking one tablet of Caprylic acid a day. Is this actually in tablet form or capsule? I would be sure to purchase the capsules and not the tablets. You can also increase the amount of these every few days as it is not unusual for a person with Candida to take up to six capsules a day. However, if you really want to combat the Candida with this supplement, the pure organic coconut oil will work much better to benefit your purpose, or you can take both. With the oil, you can use it in cooking, but the best way to obtain it is in its pure form as in a teaspoon or tablespoon. You can work up to as many as 10 to 14 tablespoons a day. Your greatest hold up in seeing less or milder symptoms is more than likely the probiotic if you’re not taking one. Unless I’m mistaken, you were going to wait until you returned to the UK to purchase this? If so, then this is probably why you’re seeing no improvements. If you can make or purchase kefir there in Bahrain you can try this as it contains a lot of the beneficial bacteria. You can probably be a little more lenient with the diet once you’ve been on the probiotics for a week or two. Able"
3,Katy Gillett,401,Hi Able – thanks for getting back to me on this.. and so quickly! I will adjust my diet accordingly… I’m so glad you said my bread is ok – that made my day and everything else is simple! 🙂 I didn’t make the oat cakes myself so I can’t answer you about the sodium bicarbonate but it does seem strange now you mention it. Luckily these aren’t something I’ve been eating for long.. The same with the sweet potatoes and blueberries so not too much damage done! I do know a place where they sell organic kefir so I will get that asap. How many times a day should I have this and the organic Greek yoghurt to be getting an alright amount of probiotics until I get more in the UK? The caprylic acid is a tablet and unfortunately they don’t sell it here in Bahrain. My mum actually sent these out last year from the UK and these were the only ones she could find but I do know a shop that has capsules (in UK) as I’ve taken them before. For now I’ll go and get some pure organic coconut oil and have that. As of tonight I’ve also switched from the caprylic acid tablet to these Kyolic Candida Clease capsules I have. so I’ll take 4 of those a day alongside as many spoonfuls of coconut oil I can handle! I realise I have another food related question that I’ve read confusion about.. what about chillies? I’ve heard they are so good for you but then read that they destroy the beneficial bacteria in our guts when we’re trying to repopulate during a battle with candida. Which is true? Thanks again Able.
4,Able900,401,"Hi, Katy. I wish you had asked me about the Kyolic Candida Cleanse. This contains protease, lipase, and glucanese all of which are enzymes. Glucanase breaks down glucans which are a chemical compound of glucose (the simplest form of sugar). I have no idea why it’s in the cleanse, but you don’t need it as part of your treatment. Besides that, the Grape Bitters will produce enzymes which your body needs in the proper amounts. Reading the ingredients of anything you purchase is something that all Candida sufferers should probably do. If you don’t know what something is, then you could ask or research it before you make your purchase. This is mainly for your protection, but also to prevent you from spending money needlessly. Another thing is, if you stay strictly on the diet, this is a cleanse in itself. The coconut oil as well as the kefir have the ability to cause die-off symptoms, so I would start slowly with each. Perhaps just two teaspoons a day of the oil just as a test; if you tolerate this without bad die-off symptoms, you could slowly increase the amount. I also suggest that you not start both of these on the same day, but wait until you’re sure that you’re not experiencing die-off symptoms from the first one you start before you start the other. Chilies are a debate matter between lots of theorists. It’s believed that they kill the bacteria in the stomach that lead to ulcers, so it seems to me that if it can kill one type of bacteria, it can also kill other types such as beneficial bacteria. If you want to, you could treat it as a test item. I don’t see how eating them once or twice a week would present a problem. Able"
5,skapwds,401,"I’ll throw my two cents in about the caprylic acid. I take two of the Now (brand) Candida Clear supplement at every meal and one before bed. They contain caprylic acid, oregano oil, pau d’arco, and black walnut. Currently my GI tract feels like a war zone, but I know everything I’m doing is for the best."
6,Katy Gillett,401,"Oops sorry Able. I thought I’d mentioned this product in a previous post to you. I think with the words ‘Candida Cleanse’ on it also, I assumed it would do the job and anything dubious could be similar to ThreeLac having yeast in it. I am an avid label reader but this is why I get so confused about what we can and can’t have because just as I think I’ve got it, I find out a surprising item we’re actually allowed or not.. Anyway I’m definitely getting better with this. I hear confusion is a symptom of Candida anyway haha (certainly one of mine!)… I’m glad you told me about the Kyolic though because I woke up panicking last night and have an anxious chest today so I’m guessing that’s why. I’ll be happy when I can get my hands on some Grape Bitters. Thanks for the tips on taking coconut oil and kefir.. I’ll start with the coconut oil seeing as I don’t have an antifungal at present. Those die-off symptoms certainly put me off though! Only 3 more days of work left though then I can feel as ill as I like hah! I’ll see about the chillies.. I want to try out a Thai green chicken curry recipe from Jamie Oliver (with minimal chillies of course!) but don’t want anything else to compromise my diet right now.. I guess I’m pretty much back where I started at the moment. But at least I’m more used to this way of life :). I have been wondering Able… How many eggs did you/do you eat in a day? Were you not worried about the cholestorol levels in your diet? Or is this another myth you’re about to dispel for me? 🙂"

Or is this another myth you’re about to dispel for me? 🙂 Yes, Katy, I am about to do just that, and personally I’m very grateful that I’m able to do so. I tried to remember the most creative statement about eggs that I’ve read, and this one came to mind from Harvard Medical School.  “Egg Nutrition and Heart Disease: Eggs Aren’t The Dietary Demons They’re Cracked Up To Be.”  You gotta love that one, and it was written back in 2006, but Harvard was actually behind with the news. The facts are that yes, eggs do have a lot of cholesterol, however, the ‘myth’ part of the story comes into play by claiming that the egg cholesterol goes into your bloodstream which eventually (according to myth) passes into your arteries. This is untrue. Just a small amount of the actual cholesterol in the food we eat is capable of passing into the bloodstream. On the other hand, the saturated fats and trans fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in food products are the culprits which can have negative effects on the blood cholesterol levels. The reason is; there has to be three ingredients in the body in sufficient amounts before the body can make the extra cholesterol which leads to high levels. The three ingredients needed to produce cholesterol are protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Another reason that eggs are safe for us is something called “lecithin” which is found in the egg yolk. Perhaps you’ve heard of lecithin, it can be purchased in vitamin stores as a health supplement. Lecithin is actually produced naturally by the human body, but it is also obtained from the foods we eat as well as supplements. Lecithin is a multi-purpose nutrient in that it improves the memory, strengthens the nerves, and the big bonus is that it’s one of the most used natural substances to actually lower cholesterol. And as I’ve stated, it can be found in egg yolks. The reason that lecithin is so useful in lowering cholesterol levels is because of the B vitamins found in eggs. In the situation of cholesterol, it’s the B vitamin Chlorine which attracts LDL cholesterol in the blood and carries it away, much like the HDL cholesterol does. Also, there has to be some merit to the fact that 50 years ago, many of our grandparents lived on farms and ate eggs as a staple food on a daily basis. However, because of all the popular ‘instant’ breakfast products, this is no longer true and yet the average number of Americans who have high cholesterol and blood pressure has greatly increased since then. Able"
8,Katy Gillett,401,"Interesting indeed. I ask because when I was first introduced to this forum I remember wondering about the amount of eggs you said you consumed but then stumbled across a study that tested the cholesterol levels of people consuming varying amounts of eggs each week and there was absolutely no difference by the end of the study. I wanted to see what you knew on this. It’s amazing how many myths are so ingrained in society’s mind. It is truly fascinating though. Able, out of personal interest, which courses have you taken over the years? I’m thinking of going down this route and wouldn’t mind some (yet more) advice from you on which direction to take… I hope you’re having a good week. Katy"
9,Able900,401,"Hello, Katy. Actually, when I was in the Navy I was able to squeeze in a few classes on Health Education while studying for my Graduate Certificate in Security Management. But since getting out I’ve taken courses in human anatomy and horticulture. When I saw this question today I remembered something you posted yesterday in the other forum that I never replied to, it was this: “Do you not ever think about going into the alternative medicine field professionally? Or is it actually already tied to what you do? Hope you don’t think I’m being nosey.” I don’t think you’re being nosey at all, and yes, I’ve thought about this field as an alternative profession, but it would be impossible. First, I would need many more courses to be able to do this for pay. Second, there is no way I would ever give up my current career, it’s too important to me and it took quite a while to become established and respected in my field. So anyway, having the two professions means I would have to literally split my focus and dedication between two different jobs, and unfortunately there’re not enough hours in the day for me to do that to the degree I would insist on. So what I do is view my career as the actual job that caters to the necessity for money, and the other as a well loved hobby. Able"

Cheers Diane"
0,skapwds,402,"Greetings from deathly hot Oklahoma! I have been struggling with what I believe to be cutaneous candidiasis for about three or four months now. It’s the result of taking bactrim for a bladder infection, go figure (bactrim is the devil, from what I’m reading). After finishing the course of bactrim I was perscribed, I developed very dry lips. No matter what kind or how much lip balm I put on, they would always be dry and flaky within minutes. It developed to the point of having an itchy, red ring around my mouth (I call it my “angry mouth”). I went to see my physician and described a single dose of diflucan. I took it, symptoms went away for a week, returned. Went back to my doc, same thing happened. Then I had to go to a minor emergency clinic to get two more doses since it recurred on a weekend. In addition, I received some topical nystatin which took the edge off a bit. My physician was going to refer me to a dermatologist since it was only on my lips when I saw him, but then it developed into lovely-looking infected sores (I’m a very clean person and the only thing I can come up with was that they became infected from the inside out) or textured, red, bruised-looking spots on my skin. So obviously, it’s systemic. (Also, some history. As a child I was on antibiotics often with no issue. After I stopped eating meat, eggs, and dairy, taking antibiotics became an issue. A couple of months before all this, I had to take a course of bactrim for a UTI and had thrush on the inside of my mouth, but only where my top front teeth touch the backside of my mouth. Cured with a dose of diflucan and topical nystatin.) I have an affinity for high-carb foods, as much as I know I should avoid a lot of what I eat, despite eating healthy compared to the rest of the general public. Before starting on this journey of self-healing, I had no idea how yeast fed itself or what I could do to stop this cycle. This website and forum has helped tremendously. Now, for the “diet” (I hate that word) part of all this: I have resumed eating seafood and eggs because I am unable to get enough protein from eating veggies. I’m following the Stage 1 protocol on this website, and the only “cheating” I’ve done is the occasional dab of unsweetened cocoa to curb my sweet tooth and a sprinkle of fresh parmesan on the occasional meal. I am on day three and I already feel like I am improving. I’ve also been putting a dash of lemon juice into ice water with some stevia to satisfy my sweet cravings. I am eating brown rice, but I know that should not be an everyday thing. Supplements I am taking: Inner Eco probiotic coconut kefir, trillion+ strain count of: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris Lactococcus lactis ssp diacetylactis Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris Lactobacillus kefyr Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus Saccharomyces unisporus Bio-K Plus original dairy culture, 50 billion+ strain count of: L. acidophilus L. casei Pure brand Candex, contains: Cellulase, 128 000 CU Hemicellulase, 80 000 HCU Amylase, 8 000 SKB Invertase, 2 000 SU Glucoamylase, 400 AG Now brand Candida Clear, contains: caprylic acid, 500mg Pau D’Arco, 300mg Black Walnut, 300mg Also swishing with coconut oil 3x daily before meals. Oregano Oil, 200mg If anyone has any input, feel free to let me know! I am feeling positive about this and can’t wait for die off, as bad as that sounds."
1,Able900,402,"Your supplement plan doesn’t look bad, that is other than the Candex which contains Cellulase, 128 000 CU and Hemicellulase, 80 000 HCU. In effect, with these two enzymes you’re feeding the Candida and in doing so you will allow them to thrive for as long as you’re taking these. Certain enzymes that are available are enzymes which are not naturally made by the human body, but yet they are put in many enzyme supplements unnecessarily. In addition, during their break down they change other enzymes into a sugar which actually ends up feeding the Candida and thus prolonging the treatment period and cure. This is the case with both cellulase and hemicellulase.  The most useful digestive enzymes is something called “Digestive Grape Bitters” and this is the exact name you want to look for. The dosage suggested on the bottle is not necessary because the bitters work simply by nerve stimulation. When the bitter tasting herbs come in to contact with the bitter receptors on the back of the tongue the bitter receptors are stimulated. This in turn stimulates the vagus nerve, which increases levels of stomach acid, bile and pancreatic enzymes. This also has a cleansing effect on the liver so it is important to drink plenty of water throughout the day when using them to prevent a strong detox reaction. Since the whole principle is to stimulate the bitter receptors and thus the vagus nerve you only need to be able to taste the bitterness of the herbs. 1/2 of a dropper full on the tongue before meals or after meals will be enough to do the job. To treat the thrush, look for a post titled “Oral Thrush.” Able"
2,skapwds,402,"I truly appreciate the reply, Able. Thank you! I stopped the Candex and took up Grapefruit Seed Extract. 10-15 drops in a glass of water before meals and bed. I will look for the digestive grape bitters. I will read the oral thrush post. Thanks again!"

0,CTMike,405,"Hello everyone, Warning!!!! This is a long post. Sorry, but this story is convoluted and complicated…. I’m at a point in working to get over Candida where things are particularly confusing. Completely different messages from my doctors… I finally got an appointment with my gastroenterologist. He had treated me for something completely different in 2009, so this was my first dealing with him about the Candida.  Up until that appointment, I saw my holistic chiropractor, who diagnosed the candida overgrowth at a severe level. He uses little vials of strains of candida in various strengths. This was back in the fall and again this March. Hard to explain how he does this. I was on a variation of the diet back in the fall and brought down the candida, but when I was tested and it was “out of my system,” I ate normally and it came right back. So I have been on the strict candida diet this spring.  I saw my regular doctor in April, who just accepted the diagnosis, no testing, (which was frustrating!), and put me on ketoconozol, (spelled wrong…)an strong anti fungal drug, for 10 days. Didn’t help. And in June I saw both the gastro doctor and had another visit with my chiropractor. The gastro doctor has been frustrating. At the appointment, he said everyone has candida in their bodies and that chiropractors all diagnose candida for any problem. He felt that the only people who get a candida overgrowth are those with diabetes, compromised immune systems or cancer patients. He dismissed the chiropractor’s diagnosis totally and told me it was highly unlikely I would have any candida overgrowth and should eat normally.  I told him I really wanted some testing. So he tested blood and stool and found I had no problem with wheat, my blood sugar is normal, no parasites or bacteria problems, normal thyroid activity. He feels that if I’m feeling better, fine, but if I feel sick he will do a MRI, and some other tests to see what the problem is. Again he does not accept that I could have a candida overgrowth. He was very concerned about the weight loss. (30 pounds or more in about 6 weeks), which he saw as unexplained! Hey, I completely changed my eating habits and was on the candida diet! I have since stayed a one weight now for over a month so my weight has stabilized.  I had the results of the tests faxed to my chiropractor and he helped me understand them a bit more. He also did his candida vials test and found I had brought my level even farther down that a recent test a couple of weeks again. He used the term “negligible” to describe the level of candida overgrowth. He has had me introduce more foods. Basically more grains and some higher carbohydrate vegetables as well as fresh ground peanut butter from the health food store in small amounts.  I plan to stay on the candida based diet for a much longer time having had the experience of the infection coming right back if you eat as one ate in the past, too soon. I’m figuring December or beyond, just to be safe. I still need to go over the gastro doctor’s test results with my regular doctor, (which I have little hope will be helpful), and then have everything faxed to my cousin, a general practitioner doctor in VT, who is traditional but doesn’t rule out holistic and other types of doctors. My friends and loved ones have been supportive, and of course concerned and confused, especially by the sudden weight loss, tireness, symptoms…. Some now wonder if I haven’t had a candida overgrowth at all and have been going through the diet and all for no reason. But if not candida, then what is this? Thanks for sticking with me this far. Right now, I’m feeling so confused and frustrated. I should be happy that my chiropractor’s tests for candida overgrowth confirm I’m “better,” (even accepting the truth of his testing methods in the first place.) Am I really better, or is there something still undiagnosed and dire looming? All these mixed messages and feeling like I don’t have all that many more answers. I wonder if getting the MRI and more complicated testing should be the next step. But the chiropractor tests showed candida overgrowth and now, a vast improvement in the infection. Hopefully I am truly getting better. In many ways I do feel much better, but in some ways no…. Thanks for sticking with this very long post. I don’t know what I want to hear from you all, just wanted to share my experience, the confusion and the frustration, with those who might understand, maybe have some insight. Best wishes to you all. Peace, Mike"
1,Able900,405,"Hi, Mike. “out of my system, I ate normally and it came right back.”  This happens often with Candida sufferers, in fact, I think with most. It’s exactly what happened with me. I’m of the belief that it takes much longer than any of us suspect to be rid of the infestation. I’m clear of all symptoms at this point, and have been for quite a while, but I do not plan on ever going back to eating “normally” again. I won’t take that chance. “The gastro doctor has been frustrating. At the appointment, he said everyone has candida in their bodies and that chiropractors all diagnose candida for any problem.”  It’s true that everyone has a certain amount of Candida in our system as it’s necessary for good health; however, a Candida infestation which turns fungal is also very possible. “He felt that the only people who get a candida overgrowth are those with diabetes, compromised immune systems or cancer patients.”  What can I say, he’s just another MD Idiot, and there are lots of those around. “I plan to stay on the candida based diet for a much longer time having had the experience of the infection coming right back if you eat as one ate in the past, too soon. I’m figuring December or beyond, just to be safe.” I’ve been on the diet for eight months, with no immediate plans for a change. My way of coping is focusing on one day at a time, that and being grateful that I no longer have any Candida symptoms at all thanks to the diet, antifungals, and heavy doses of probiotics. “But if not candida, then what is this? … Am I really better, or is there something still undiagnosed and dire looming?” What are your current symptoms? “Hopefully I am truly getting better. In many ways I do feel much better, but in some ways no….” In what ways do you ‘not’ feel better? Thanks for posting.  Able"
2,Hope,405,"I’m so sorry it’s been confusing. It does seem, though, that if both practioners said your candida issues were “neglible” and if your tests are returning normal, that’s surely a good sign that something is working well for you 🙂 I would echo Able’s last questions – what are your symmptoms now? What’s troubling you that you feel may still be candida related?"
0,jackandmasonsmom,406,"For the past two years, I have dealt with what I believe now to be a Candida issue. I have always had reoccuring vaginal yeast infections that now just seem to be a persistent issue that I’ve learned to deal with, have chicken skin (have had it for ever, acne flair ups and serious issues with bloating/gas that can be very painful. I was diagnosed with IBS when I was in college that subsided after the birth of my first child but as things started to change hormonally with my body & age, I have thought that maybe my IBS had come back – until I found out about Candida. It sounds like there aren’t very many medical professionals who know about it or are willing to treat it so am I wondering if I’m up to self-diagnosing myself and seeing if a change in diet helps me or struggle to find a Dr who doesn’t think that I’m just depressed and need to up my antidepressant meds to “fix me”. Any help or feedback would be GREATLY appreciated. This is something that I haven’t even broached with my husband until I think I’ve got a grasp on what I need to do to feel better. Thanks so much in advance!"
1,Able900,406,"Hello, welcome to the Candida Diet forum. If you do decide to see a doctor for a Candida diagnosis or treatment I would first search to see if there are any Naturopathic physicians in your area instead of a regular medical doctor. http://www.naturopathic.org/content.asp?contentid=60 If you decide to do the diagnosis and treatment yourself, the people here on the forum can definitely help you with that as well as offering support whenever you need it. The way most of us did a self-diagnosis I suppose was to go on the diet and see what happens. For example, I noticed a slight difference in my symptoms within a week of starting the diet, plus, you’ll probably experience die-off symptoms after starting the diet, and this is another clue that it’s Candida you’re suffering from. Remember that you can always come here for advice and support. Able"
2,whyitsme,406,"I agree, I basically diagnosed myself once figured out food allergies were a major problem. I had naturopath give me antifunagls and then I just did diet on own. You will notice difference in first week if it is a problem. I had friend who tried it, and it wasn’t her issue, so noticed no difference. Just by change of diet without antifungals you will notice a difference, so if you want to save the trip to the doctor then just try the candida diet for a week. (no need to do cleanse in my opinion either)"
0,niki,407,I am desperate for some motivation. I am only 21 and have sufferred with endless candidia symptoms for over 4 years. Finally I was told to go on this diet and have been sticking to the diet about 60% for the last 8 weeks. I understand the only way I will see a difference is by doing this 100%. Any suggestions on how to stay motivated?
1,Able900,407,"Hi, Niki. Wow, 60% … and you’re saying that the reason is because you’re not motivated to cure the Candida that has held your body captive for four years? Is that because the Candida isn’t bothering you enough to cause you to go all the way with the diet? So you’re thinking you can’t find the motivation. I can say that all I needed for motivation was the thought that one day I’d be rid of the beast that was keeping me from enjoying life 100% – which was what I had been used to for my entire life. I guess you could say that the idea of no longer enjoying life to its fullest was not acceptable for me, and therefore all the motivation I needed. I guess that doesn’t work for everyone. So, since I can’t think of a motivation that could possibly be stronger than simply wanting to be in perfect health and enjoy life to its fullest, I have to say that I have no idea how to motivate you. Sorry, but I really do hope you find that motivation, and soon. Able"
2,Hope,407,"Hi, there 🙂 I think everyone has to have their own, personal motivation. Not sure anyone can tell you what yours should be. I would say, though, to take some time – alone, if possible – to relax and really think about what you want. Do you want to keep eating “normal” foods more than you really want to get well? If the answer is “yes”, ask yourself why. If you decide that you want to get well *more* than you want to eat normal foods, I’d say still ask yourself “why?” 🙂 Knowing a good, solid, concrete reason for WHY this is all worth it is pretty critical, I think. For Able, the big reason is to finally live life to the fullest. That’s his “why” and he goes back to it as inspiration in tough times. For me, I’m expecting a baby, and I want the baby to be healthy. Also, I WANT TO BE HEALTHY – I know that our marriage and our entire family life will benefit from my health. That’s a huge motivator for me. Candida is literally a time when you can’t have your cake and eat it, too 😉 You can’t have *both* your normal lifestyle with normal food AND optimal health. You have to choose between the two. But, like I said before, no one can make that choice for you. Take some time to really think and question, pray if you do, and decide… do you really want to take the diet seriously or is it just not worth it to you. I really hope you find a good reason to go for it, and stick with the diet. There’s so much in life worth being healthy for 🙂"
3,NeekyNoo,407,"Hi Niki, For me, I have got more and more motivation as I’ve gone along. I’ve tried a variety of different approaches; ‘quick fixes’, less restrictive, half hearted, and each time my attempts have failed I’ve been determined to clear it up the next time. I think finding this website has really helped me; the dietary advice, recipes and the forum. I have had Candida twice, and the first time I cleared it up fairly easily, this time is proving a lot harder. I don’t know when I got it the first time, but I look back at my life when I was around the age of 21 (I’m 31 now) and I’m sure I had it then. I wish I’d known, so I could have done something about it, but I also know what my lifestyle was like, and don’t know how motivated I would have been to clear it up.  It is hard work, especially when you see everyone around you eating so ‘normally’ but try and see it as a positive learning experience. I have learnt so much about what goes into our foods, and wouldn’t want to eat most pre-made foods now anyway. Don’t beat yourself up about mistakes that you make, and hopefully your desire to be well will be enough to motivate you in the long run. You’ve done the diet 60%, how about increasing that to 70%, then 80% etc? It will get easier to do. Good luck 🙂"
4,2ndRound,407,"One thing that I’ve found that helps for me, is the results I had after my first cleanse. See, I didn’t realize it, but I couldn’t really taste or smell food very well anyway, probably due to an overgrowth of Candida in my mouth. I hit about day 13 of my cleanse (I used a different program, Candigone kit) and then BOOM EVERYTHING I ate started to SURPRISE ME. All of a sudden the herbs I was taking tasted herby to the point where I was like ‘yuck what the…’ and then everything was just so much more delicious! So to stay motivated this time I’ve been just reminding myself that cheating on my diet will just make everything not taste as good anyway. The enjoyable cheat you have now will just cut out the everyday wonderful experience of being able to fully taste your food overall. And one of the primary reasons to eat badly is to feel and sense the food anyway right? Nutritional value cheats are not high on the list. Also if you’re considering ‘hey how will junk food taste after I properly cleanse then?’ Well, on my first round I rewarded myself with a hunk of cheesecake. Couldn’t resist. OK I’m lying it was TWO slices of cheesecake, one when it hit midnight of my last cleanse day and one for breakfast in the morning. So bad. I know it set me back but I didn’t care. Over the years my diet has gradually changed to be REALLY healthy but had included bad for Candida foods, but doing this second round I’m cutting them out again BUT I’m more lax on things like store bought herbs and non-organics of beans and chickpeas veggies and I’m including some higher sugar veggies (peas and carrots) but in very small quantities so it make day to day on this round easier then the first because of its variety. But I will say, your taste buds end up changing to actually LIKE the healthier foods more. I will still have some potato chips when not cleansing but I try to buy the healthier version, because you’ll be able to taste the cheap additive crap they put into the stuff that goes into the regular brands. Finally, there are people out there who say willpower is a myth and there can be some merit to that, so try and remove everything from your kitchen that isn’t part of your cleanse diet to avoid temptation. My first time round I had a specific drawer in my fridge I dumped all the “do not eats” into and didn’t open it until after I was well done the cleanse. This time around I have become such a habitual coffee drinker so when I started I removed the cup that holds the coffee grounds the machine percolates into and stuck it in the back of my cupboard. I use the coffee maker to keep a warm pot of tea handy and ready to drink most of the day and that really helps. Best of luck in your changing your diet! 🙂 And don’t be too hard on yourself, our body is made up of more bacteria then most people thing (generally about 10% according to the biology class on http://www.khanacademy.org) and it can and does influence us in ways we don’t fully understand yet. Don’t be too hard on yourself."
5,BenjiRixon,407,"If it’s inspiration your after I’d look no further than a topic called “cured” in this subforum. There’s a post from able in there detailing what can happen if candida is left and not taken seriously. Basically first signs are the yeast turns to fungal form, then causes leaky gut where toxins are dumped into your blood stream causing an auto immune disorder where the body starts fighting itself, then sepis occurs and only 1 in 3 people don’t survive past that. Is staying alive enough motivation?? It is for me lol ! I’m using my iPhone at the moment but when I get to my laptop later I’ll link the post here. Over and out Benji"
6,BenjiRixon,407,"heres the extract from ables post Medical Fact: When Candida is left untreated in the early stages, the disease has been known to cause death to the patient. If Candida progresses to a stage during which it enters the bloodstream, it is then referred to as Candida Sepsis. I imagine most if not all of you know what the word “sepsis” means, but if you don’t, I will place the definition below. When it reaches this stage, it is extremely difficult to treat and to successfully overcome. Once it reaches this point, the death rate from the disseminated Candidiasis infestation can easily reach 30% and higher. For this reason, let alone the pain and suffering both emotionally and physically that the patient endures, a dedicated treatment of Candida in its very early stages cannot be overstated. Sepsis: “Sepsis is the body’s response to a bacterial infection. Your immune system goes into overdrive, which overwhelms the normal processes of your blood. The result is small blood clots forming and blocking the blood flow to vital organs, which in turn can lead to organ failure. Even healthy people can become deathly ill from any type of sepsis. Quick diagnosis and treatment are crucial, because at least one third of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis die from it.” Even if Candida does not reach this level of overgrowth, even a mild to serious case can cause a condition known as Intestinal Hyper-Permeability, also called Leaky Gut Syndrome. This occurs when the wall of the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by the Candida when it changes its form and creates something called rhizoids, a root like structure which breaks into the intestinal walls. The ‘breaks’ allow molecules such as partially digested fats, toxins and proteins to get through the walls. The body of course sees these substances as foreign forms, and therefore will make antibodies to fight them. This in turn causes the patient to quickly become allergic to various foods which they would previously been able to eat without a problem. By the way, a “rhizoid” is a root type filament which anchors itself to a foundation for the purpose absorbing a food source from the foundation which in turn sustains its existence. If Leaky Gut Syndrome cannot be healed soon, it eventually leads to many different vitamin deficiencies, as well as deficiencies of minerals such as zinc which causes eye disorders (macular degeneration). Copper deficiencies are normal with leaky guy syndrome which leads to Osteoarthritis and elevated blood cholesterol."
0,Rockinbetty,408,"So after much awaited time of searching the internet and doctor visits, I’ve found this site..and am excited to say that I will start the diet/detox this weekend. But there is one thing that has been driving me up the wall. Whenever I have sex with my boyfriend, I break out in an awful infection…and he does too ): Granted, I think I was the first one to start the cycle, since he never had them before…his last about a week and then symptoms go away… I finished a diflucan and yogurt overdosing last month and then it happened again! and this time its awful and painful and awful.. again, I went to the doctor today..and decided to force a diflucan on my boyfriend..but is there ever a way to stop this?? Or am I cursed for life?! I’m doing this diet for myself. I’m tired of this “BS” . Over the coarse of the last 10 months, I’ve pretty much changed my diet..exercise everyday, no alcohol, almost no breads or pastas, and sugar intake minimal to a piece of dark chocolate every once in a while.. Has anyone else had similar experiences?? I’m so desperate for support or advice or anything ): It’s so depressing. I’m hoping this diet and new lifestyle will help me."
1,Hope,408,"I don’t want to cause conflict between you and your boyfriend, but it’s true that partners can pass candida back and forth to one another. It sounds like he really needs to go on the diet, too. But, I know that might be a huge battle 🙁 At least you could use condoms? If you just keep passing it back and forth, the diet isn’t going to help you long term. Not happy news. I know."
2,Rockinbetty,408,"Thank you for at least responding!!! I actually tried to explain this theory to him, and he thought I was just making it up..since his symptoms clear up so fast..but yes, we are using condoms now.. I actually got Diflucan from my doctor and was planning on giving him one.. is it possible that he can give it back even if he doesn’t have symptoms? No matter what, I think I’m going to do the diet…I feel like my good bacteria is down or my immune system..but if this “tag team infection” is whats happening, then I will feel a little more relief. Thanks Hope"
3,LolloRosso,408,"I didn’t know that, my Fiance has been having many similar Candida Symptoms over the last couple of years. I feel terrible thinking I have infected him with this :0("
4,Hope,408,"I’m not sure what to tell you. You know I’m not a health care practicioner or anything 😉 I can share, though, that a good friend of mine is currently on the diet *not* because of her symptoms, but because of her *husband’s* symptoms. He’s off the charts on those candida questionairre thingymabobs. The chiropractor they’re seeing really stressed that they both needed to go on the diet – strictly – to avoid contant reinfection. I don’t know if this is because his symptoms are so severe (and he’s had them, literally, for years and years) or if this is just standard practice for couples. My husband isn’t on the diet, but we’re using condoms. Which is hilarious, because I’m pregnant right now! 😉 I’m sorry I don’t know more, but I hope you all can figure out what’s best for you both."
5,2ndRound,408,"Friend of mine who had never had it before said he had gotten it from his girlfriend. He said specifically that if the partner exposed to it doesn’t have a healthy immune system, then it can be transferred, and that’s how he got it. He just didn’t happen to be as healthy as he used to be for awhile (he’d been dating her for awhile) and it got transferred."
0,Ethanbaker,409,Can anyone please help me out by sharing your views on what is meant by a candida diet ?
1,kelandu,409,"As far as Im aware its just a complete change of eating to help eliminate candida. Because most foods feed it you have to find the ones that dont and it just becomes a way of life to do it. Have you looked at the diet itself to see which foods to eat and avoid? also you will need antifungals such as garlic, caprillic acid etc to kill the excess candida . Its easy to undertand once you have all the facts in front of you , its just hard to follow because you realise how restricitve it is. Ive been doing it for 4 months and Im feeling heaps better although Im sticking to this for life I think x"
2,Whitney,409,"A Candida Diet is a cleansing diet meant to rid the body of excess yeast. Candida Albicans is a common type of yeast found in the body that when left unchecked can lead to yeast overgrowth.

We have been to our local health shop and the man there is fab and says loads of people come in with candida. he suggested trying acidophulus plus and if there is an improvement then he probably has it. He has been on the diet for over a week now and for the last 3 / 4 days has had no pain. I suppose it doesn’t matter if it works hey!!!

0,carrotflowers,411,"I hope I’m not speaking too soon, but it seems like I’ve cured my candida. I want to share it because when I first started searching around, it seemed like I was stuck with it forever — I have yet to find someone to post a positive candida story online. So here’s mine!!! I’ll try to make this as short as possible…. my candida symptoms surfaced after I got my tonsils taken out. Before and after surgery, I was on several rounds of antibiotics, and got a TERRIBLE case of thrush. My oral surgeon said that its typical, since my mouth was closed all day, I ate/drank less, and the antibiotics, of course. He prescribed me some antifungals and sent me on my merry way. Months later, I hadn’t really thought about the thrush since it wasn’t causing any pain/itching anymore (even though my tongue was still pretty white)… my hands and feet starting tingling/cramping/hurting, i had muscle spasms all over, and eventually I got really sick. Flu-like aches, congestion, fever. My doc saw the white tongue, said it was probably some sort of infection, and just told me to drink lots of water… which (obviously) didn’t do the trick. Well, then I did some intense research. I was panicking, of course, expecting the worst. I went from thinking it was MS, to fibromyalgia, to eventually, (of course!) candida. I finally remembered the thrush, and it all made sense. So, here’s the combination of things I did that seemed to have helped me(dare I say cure again?) FOOD Two weeks of incredibly strict no sugar diet. Here’s what I ate lots of: Salads, with onion, lots of garlic, lemon juice Quinoa Oatmeal (sweetened with stevia) Walnuts and Almonds Celery with almond butter Rice Rice cakes/crackers Green Tea (at least one cup per day) I reintroduced natural sugar slowly, and stayed away from the refined stuff/carbs for another month and a half. ANTIFUNGALS I started right away with natural antifungals: coconut oil, aloe, raw garlic, and garlic capsules. (I tried to switch between these, so the candida didn’t get used to it!) I also bought a bottle of herbal pills called “Candida Detox,” which had oregano oil, pau d’arco, and lots of other good stuff!, I also took a multivitimin, fish oil, vitiman c, zinc, psyllium husk, and a probiotic EVERY DAY. And occasionally, I’d drink a cup of Traditional Medicinal’s Daily Detox Tea. EXCERSISE Definitely important. If I was feeling lethargic or achy, I would hit up the gym, and feel noticeably better after. Here’s my routine: Yoga once a week Spin class once a week Some other form of cardio (treadmill, usually) at least once a week So I was feeling pretty good after a few weeks, but much to my frustration, I was occasionally getting the weird hand pain, and the muscle spasms everywhere! So.. I think the real icing on the cake (so to speak) was getting acupuncture! I had never gotten it before, and wanted to try it out, and you guys, it totally worked. I used to get probably 500 muscle spasms a day (at least!). I now probably get 1 or 2 every other day, if that!  And now, I feel great. Even though I don’t have much refined sugar anymore, I have had some of it if I’m at a restaurant, party, etc, with no repercussions! I also have been drinking coffee again fairly regularly (though not as much as I used to!) and I still feel amazing. I hope this is helpful! I think I covered everything, but if not, please feel free to ask questions!!!"
1,NeekyNoo,411,"Hiya, It’s great to hear a positive story, and I really hope you aren’t speaking too soon. I’ve been trying different approaches over the last year, and went to see a Chinese herbalist. Candida isn’t recognised in Chinese medicine but I got accupuncture and cupping as well as some supplements.  I started to feel better, went on a sugar binge and then felt worse agin! I lost faith in the treatment and didn’t finish my course. I’ve been thinking about going back and you’ve inspired me to actually do it. How many treatments have you had?"
2,veg2,411,"that’s awesome! I’m so happy for you! thanks for posting, I have googled ‘candida success stories’ and other such things and you are right, people do make it seem like if you ever look at a carb or a cocktail again you’ll perish- so it’s nice to hear some positive feedback!"
3,Lily,411,"So lovely to read something positive! I really hope you are ‘cured’. Just out of interest, did you ever try the spit test? It’s supposed to be a tell tale sign of yeast overgrowth. There’s something about it on the site somewhere. My spit had legs. Very unpleasant! Just wondered if you tried it as would be interesting if you’d done a before and after!"
4,carrotflowers,411,"@NeekyNoo, I just had one acupuncture treatment! The guy was really good, and although he seemed to have no idea what I was talking about when I mentioned candida and my symptoms that worsen post-sugar consumption, a big part of his diagnosis and plan for treatment comes from looking at patients’ tongues. At this point, mine was still pretty white ish, so I’m guessing he took that into consideration!I would recommend him to you, but I noticed you’re from the UK lol. Good luck!!! @Lily, I did do the spit test, but I didn’t take it too seriously, since I’ve heard it’s not really reliable. Mine was pretty cloudy and “leggy” as well. Now it’s definitely better, but still a little cloudy… I don’t know what’s normal! I should ask one of my roommates who are presumably candida-free to see what healthy spit looks like, haha"
5,Hope,411,"That’s very good news, Carrots 🙂 So, all told it was 8 weeks? 2 weeks of strict detox and then 6 weeks of gradual reintroductions? May I ask what you’re eating now – are there foods you’re still avoiding? I think I’d be really leary of trying a number of foods, yet, if I were you. There are so many stories of having yest recurrences just weeks after “ending” an anti-candida diet. I’d love to hear what it seems you’re currently able to tolerate, though. Congrats to you!"

Hearing your story will make me want to carry on even more, sunshine"
8,Able900,411,"Actually, Carrot, you were never on an “incredibly strict no sugar diet” as you wrote, not if you were eating rice, rice cakes and ordinary crackers. Even if you were ingesting some sort of all-bran crackers, brown rice and brown rice cakes, you were still putting sugar in your body, just more slowly than you would have with white rice. Brown rice is a starch, and it turns into sugar once it is broken down by your system. I’m curious about what type of oatmeal you were eating. Most likely, this was also being converted into sugar once in your system. I certainly hope that the Candida sufferers on the forum will resist taking your advice to heart; with even a somewhat mild case of Candida, your diet would add months to their treatment period and suffering. Able"
9,Hope,411,"Able, do you eat any grains, then? I’m assuming from your comments that you don’t eat brown rice. I’m confused by your condemnation of foods that convert to “sugars” once digested. Our bodies *do* need sugars – eventually even vegetables get broken down into fructose. Red peppers and other veggies, for instance, contain glucose and fructose both. So, avoiding all foods that convert to sugars would be nearly impossible and unhealthy. I understand that brown rice is digested more quickly than other grains and has a higher glycemic index rating. Is that what you meant? I cannot eat puffed brown rice or brown rice crackers w/o a reaction, and I only use brown rice flour sparingly with other grains. However, I do eat whole grain brown rice 3-4 times per week."

Able I cured my candida, the first time round, with a fairly relaxed diet and it cleared up within 6 weeks. I got it again after taking antibiotics and it is proving MUCH harder to get rid of. Everyone is different and I think it depends on many different factors in ones life, health and wellbeing. To categorically say that everyone would suffer if they followed this would suffer is unfair. I’m sorry if you are having a really tough time with it, but some people are luckier."
11,Able900,411,"Hope wrote: Able, do you eat any grains, then? I’m assuming from your comments that you don’t eat brown rice. I’m confused by your condemnation of foods that convert to “sugars” once digested. Greetings. No, Hope, I don’t eat grains or carbohydrates at all other than what small amount of carbs I obtain from coconut flour, the vegetables I eat, and a hand full of blueberries I have every few days. Human beings can live without carbohydrates, and they can live healthier. For example, our body makes the necessary amount of cholesterol that is needed in order to survive. When there is an overabundance of cholesterol in one’s body, that extra cholesterol was created by an overabundance of certain food products in the body. Three ingredients are needed in order for your body to make extra cholesterol, namely, protein, fats, and carbohydrates. One can easily see how too many of the three of these is the reason that we Americans are notorious for our high cholesterol levels. I’m very sorry that I confused you with my post, and yes, I was speaking of the high glycemic rate in many foods as opposed to that of vegetables. Please believe that I am by no means condemning your diet, and please allow me to explain why I view the Candida diet as I do: Have you experienced the Herxheimer response, also known as die-off symptoms? If you have, you probably realize how terrible this experience can be. I’ve talked with Candida sufferers who have actually passed out from this part of the Candida cure, and yes, I also experienced it during the worse time of my infestation. Part of the reason that this continues to take place in our bodies is because, if we are using any of the stronger antifungal products fairly often, and not following the diet precisely as it was meant to be followed, what we are actually doing is fighting a war in which we are aiding the enemy with needed supplies such as rations. Do you see my point? By doing this, we are constantly allowing more Candida to grow and survive, and yet attempting to kill them off at the same time. It becomes nothing less than a continuous cycle of feeding and killing, thus experiencing the die-off symptoms over and over again, and unnecessarily prolonging the Candida cure. Perhaps not everyone will experience it in this manner, but I know of many who have. Of course there are mild cases of Candida in which a milder diet can be tolerated. But do you wonder how many Candida sufferers are really aware of whether their case is that of a mild, moderate, or severe case of Candida? I know that I was not aware that I had a mild case until it changed into a different form, and then I became acutely aware. I hope that my reply to Neeky’s post will further explain my position, and I’m truly sorry for the lack of clarity in my previous post. Sincerely, Able"
12,Able900,411,"NeekyNoo wrote: To categorically say that everyone would suffer if they followed this is unfair. I’m sorry if you are having a really tough time with it, but some people are luckier. To be sure you understand, thankfully I’m not having a ‘tough time’ with this or any other health problem at the moment. I did have a mild case of Candida which started late last year. It was a ‘mild’ case until I went against the diet and decided that I was well enough to start eating a few items that I was not enjoying previously on the diet; foods such as an occasional red apple, half a sweet potato, and occasionally a few whole-wheat crackers. Eventually I was hit with the full force of a Candida infestation. The Candida I had before this was really nothing compared to what I was feeling at that time, because this ‘new’ Candida was at least five times worse than anything I had previously experienced. Today, I am without a single Candida symptom, but only because of the protocol which I followed devotedly, diet included. However, I still have to be very careful and not eat anything that may feed the left over Candida in my system, as I am aware that it will take many more months before my body is completely rid of this disease. I’ve spent the last six or seven months studying every volume of information I’ve been able to uncover in the area of Candida causes and treatments (and failures).  What I’ve learned is to take this disease as seriously as I possibly can. I’ve also learned why, on many forums, you will find people who have suffered from Candida for 10 to 20 years without a cure. Medical Fact: When Candida is left untreated in the early stages, the disease has been known to cause death to the patient.  If Candida progresses to a stage during which it enters the bloodstream, it is then referred to as Candida Sepsis. I imagine most if not all of you know what the word “sepsis” means, but if you don’t, I will place the definition below.

Sepsis: “Sepsis is the body’s response to a bacterial infection. Your immune system goes into overdrive, which overwhelms the normal processes of your blood. The result is small blood clots forming and blocking the blood flow to vital organs, which in turn can lead to organ failure. Even healthy people can become deathly ill from any type of sepsis. Quick diagnosis and treatment are crucial, because at least one third of the people who are diagnosed with sepsis die from it.” Even if Candida does not reach this level of overgrowth, even a mild to serious case can cause a condition known as Intestinal Hyper-Permeability, also called Leaky Gut Syndrome. This occurs when the wall of the gastrointestinal tract is damaged by the Candida when it changes its form and creates something called rhizoids, a root like structure which breaks into the intestinal walls. The ‘breaks’ allow molecules such as partially digested fats, toxins and proteins to get through the walls.

If Leaky Gut Syndrome cannot be healed soon, it eventually leads to many different vitamin deficiencies, as well as deficiencies of minerals such as zinc which causes eye disorders (macular degeneration). Copper deficiencies are normal with leaky guy syndrome which leads to Osteoarthritis and elevated blood cholesterol. Am I attempting to scare people into taking this disease more seriously? Maybe I am, so pardon me if I take Candida more seriously than some people think I should. What I type here on the forum is done for no other purpose than because I really do hate to see good people suffering, people who, in the beginning of their disease could be healed completely and much quicker than they will later on, but instead do not take a fairly light case of their disease quite seriously enough, and therefore often go in the opposite direction of a healthy recovery. I truly hope you do not believe that I spend time on these posts which I write simply because I enjoy berating people for not listening or not taking their disease seriously enough, and I sincerely apologize to each of you, and I am asking your forgiveness if I have seemed impudent in my posts. I assure you that I did not intend to present myself in this manner. Able"
13,Hope,411,"Able, you don’t need to apologize. I wasn’t clear on what you were saying, and now I am. Thank you for taking the time to post all of that 🙂 My candida is mild. On questionaires right now, I’m actually below “mild” symptomatically. *But*, I know I had clear cut candida issues at the onset – thrush, skin rashes. The thrush was in conjunction with an antibiotic, but still. I want to see this thing through, not just jump for a piece of fruit immediately because nearly all of my symptoms seem resolved. Anyway… I agree with you that going w/o grains would be ideal for most people in terms of how long it might take to get rid of the yeast. However, I’m pregnant and I already have 4 children at home to care for – without grains my energy levels were too low. With 1-2 small servings a day, I’m much better off and my baby’s weight gain is better. I’m careful now (although I wasn’t at the beginning) to not include too many servings of brown rice. I lean toward a millet/raw buckwheat combo more. I also agree that it will take longer to get rid of this candida with some grains in my diet than it would without them. My die-off symptoms have been very light – fatigue, mostly – and I’m trying to keep it that way to avoid exposing the baby to high levels of toxic by-products. It will take longer, I know. But it seems to me that my pregnancy kind of demands the slow & gradual path. I began Stage 1 on April 2nd, and I’m still there. Haven’t reintroduced a thing. No potatos, no sweet potatos. I had to have another antibiotic 5 weeks in, though, so I consider that to be pretty much starting all over again. So, although I’ve been on the diet for over 10 weeks, I feel like that antibiotic set me back to square one and I’m really only on about Week 4 or so. I’m curious for a few more details of this Bigger Badder Candida that came about for you in Stage 2 the first time around How long had you been in Stage 1 before you started trying to reintroduce foods and had the reactions? I’d rather stay in Stage 1 for the rest of my pregnancy (12-15 more weeks) than have a huge wave of candida hit me like that. My intention had been to reintroduce a few of the lowest sugar fruits 3x/week or so in a month or so. Blueberries, raspberries, rhubarb. I’ll look forward to hearing a little more about your experience with reintroducing."
14,Able900,411,"Hope, thank you for the explanation and for sharing your experience of Candida. Well, it seems you’ve made some fantastic headway on your journey to cure Candida. I understand your caution since you are pregnant, a very wise decision no doubt, and I completely understand that the baby’s health and growth are of utmost importance. I was in stage 1 of the diet for just about two months when I started introducing new foods. The “bigger badder” Candida made me feel horrible. I had next to no energy compared to what I had before, and even though I was experiencing the constant hunger, I had no appetite at all and it was a chore just to eat a meal. I lost over 20 pounds during that fairly short period, and really did not need to. I’ve managed to gain 15 of those pounds back, and I’m satisfied with my present weight. But at that time, nothing tasted good, nothing at all. Plus I was experiencing the die-off symptoms almost every day, no doubt because of the strong and numerous antifungals I was taking. Fortunately, I have my own business, so I was able to take advantage of this when I needed some time off. I only mentioned the Candida to my doctor one time during a regular checkup, and I knew right away that I was wasting my time, so of course I never depended on a doctor for advice. What I’ve reintroduced so far to my diet this time is a short list indeed, namely blueberries three times a week, dried beans once or twice a week, and drinking a little almond milk occasionally as well as using it in cooking. Instead of reintroducing the ‘old’ food products, I’ve decided to stay on this healthier diet for as long as I can, hopefully forever in other words. I know that I feel a lot better eating the way I now do, and I’ve overcome the most difficult part for me. That was allowing my body to become accustomed to virtually no carbohydrates without giving out or giving up, but once I was over the Candida enough to feel a lot better and stop the enormous hunger feeling, the almost- carbohydrate-free diet became a lot easier. Fortunately I’ve discovered several products which allow me to still enjoy eating and a good meal. The coconut flour is just one example. I can eat ‘bread’ three times a day if I choose without worrying about what I’m putting into my body. Lots of people do not like the taste of this bread, but I doctor it up by brushing it with olive oil and sprinkling sea salt, garlic, and mixed herbs on it and then toasting it in the oven. To me, it’s just as enjoyable as the garlic bread I used to have. I can now enjoy egg salad sandwiches (which I really did miss in the beginning). Of course I don’t use mayonnaise, but I found the Yellow Organic Mustard which is made with apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, and I use this to make egg salad and deviled eggs as well as coleslaw, which is another item that I missed terribly for a long time. I also purchased some of the organic condensed coconut cream and even made some coconut cookies using it and the coconut flour; which by the way I won’t be doing again, much too sweet for my taste. But I do enjoy the condensed cream mixed in Greek yogurt as a snack as well as part of my breakfast. The yogurt and thick cream together give a nice sweet/sour flavor that I’ve not found in other foods on this diet, a welcome changed. I didn’t entertain guests, other than my girlfriend, for a long time, but a week ago I invited two other couples for a late dinner. I only prepared the food that I eat, with the main dish being stove-top baked herb Danish hens, which they couldn’t brag enough about, several steamed vegetables, a salad, and the coconut-flour bread the way I make it. I mixed the condensed coconut cream with Greek yogurt and added blueberries and a little Truvia to it for dessert, and you would have thought that I spent hours in the kitchen preparing this dish considering the way everyone wanted seconds … and thirds. I’m curious about the antibiotic you had to take five weeks into the diet. Was it very apparent as far as the Candida was concerned that you were taking it? When you start reintroducing foods such as the fruits you named, I’m sure you’re aware that you need to start only one fruit at a time and in a single week. After the second outbreak, I literally stopped eating everything but eggs and green vegetables. That’s how bad I felt and I was determined to ‘do it right’ this time. Gradually, I began slowly trying other things, even foods that were ‘allowed’ on the stage one diet such as coconut, chicken and meat. While doing this, I would go without food (which I know you probably can’t do) for at least five or six hours, then eat only a little of the food I was testing. If I received any type of reaction, there was no doubt about what caused it. This is how I discovered that I had to leave red meat alone. For protein I eat only organic chicken, eggs, and sardines. I eat sardines because, being young fish, they’re one of the lowest-mercury-containing fish we can eat. Hope, when reading your posts I can feel the energy of wisdom that you share with others. Your children are very fortunate to have you as their mom. I wish only the very best for you and your family. Able"
0,rose8marie,412,"Hello,  I have just recently started the candida diet. This is my 4th day on the diet and I just went to a health foods store to buy some foods that I could eat (which cost me a pretty penny!). The first day of my diet, I wasn’t able to go to the store and therefore the first couple days of my diet I really didn’t have much to eat (except yogurt and cucumbers!). The first day that I realized I needed to go on the diet was heartbreaking. I am a huge pasta and BREAD fan! As I read all the foods that I would have to cut out of my diet, I realized it was almost every food that I eat on a daily basis! The first days of the diet, I felt very disheartened and almost like life was over (my family is very big on food!). After I truly devoted myself to this diet, I was all in! I started focusing on the foods I CAN have instead of those I can’t. When I found this website, I was so relieved! FINALLY, I found recipes for the foods that I can have, and pretty good-looking recipes too! This website has been a savior, and also after reading through alot of the forums, I have found alot of good advice too. I have gone all-out on this diet and am feeling pretty optimistic about it, although I have had acouple of problems along the way (but it’s only my fourth day!).  The first couple days I felt SO DRAINED! It felt like I was being dragged everywhere. I also had some bad caffeine withdrawal, which I’m very sensitive to normally. On top of that was sugar withdrawal, which I usually use to counteract the caffeine withdrawal. Before I was able to go to the store, I almost gave up. I was thinking that it wasn’t worth it changing my whole lifestyle. I live with my boyfriend and his parents and it’s hard to eat in this house without cheese, bread, and pasta on the table. I don’t want to put a burden on them, as they are who I care about, but I feel as though they will have to change to accommodate me! Also, my boyfriend keeps telling me that this is just too much, that I’m having to change too much for this. But I feel like this is something that will really work and will really help me. He also doesn’t like the fact that this is a lifestyle change, and not just a one time thing. It is hard to do, but I know I’m strong enough to do it. I have tried to do something similar in the past, as I have had yeast infections for a while. I remember looking up foods to avoid, but I never really wen t through with it. After getting yeast infections once a month, accompanied with a UTI every month, I decided to do something about it (my boyfriend is also getting them now!). I will definitely keep up with it and probably post an update once a week, mainly to keep myself on track, but also to provide any helpful hints, advice, or support that I find while on the diet! Wish me luck!"
1,Hope,412,"Hi, RoseMarie! 🙂 And welcome to the forums! Your attitude sounds great – like you’re really determined. That’s wonderful 🙂 Hopefully, your boyfriend will get to a point where he can be supportive, too. Did you know that some UTIs are yeast-related and not bacterial? Have you ever asked your practitioner whether they sent a urine sample for a culture to determine the source of the infection? An antibiotic will do nothing to help a fungal (yeast) UTI. In fact, it will only make them worse. You may already know all this, but just in case, I thought I’d mention it. By the way, you mentioned that your boyfriend’s beginning to have symptoms, too. Man, I hope I don’t just create some kind of huge battle between the two of you with this info, but you should know that candida can be passed back and forth between sexual partners. You can be on the diet and doing well, but it’s possible that he can give it back to you if he has it, too, and you’re intimate. A good friend of mine is on the diet right now just because of her husband’s candida symptoms. Their health care practioner wanted to be certain she wasn’t just passing it back to him. This might turn out to be a really great period of growth in your relationship with your boyfriend. You can really learn a lot about communicating with one another with respect and love, supporting one another in sickness and in health, putting one another first. I don’t know how long you’ve been together, but difficult and stressful times like the one you’ve just started (any big change, even a good one, is stressful) can really move a relationship forward. Hoping the first stage of the diet goes well for you!!! 🙂"
2,rose8marie,412,"Hope, Thanks for your thoughtful words! You actually raise a good point that I didn’t think of. I didn’t think of this as an opportunity for growth, but I can definitely look to that as a possibility. Thanks again!"
0,natnmargie,413,"Hi there! Back in 2004, I discovered I was “hyperthyroid”…and then suspiciously it got better for several years and shortly thereafter I discovered that I had Candida…badly. I fought Candida, did Cleanse after Cleanse and finally had it where I thought it was at least “under control” and I could live with it until the end of 2009. Life during all of this time was stressful with 3 close family members dying and stress of buying and selling a new home and moving…which didn’t help my Candida issues. November of 2009, I went for a physical and my thyroid was tested and I was “super Hyperthyroid” with a resting heart beat of 120 beats per minute and absolutely exhausted all of the time. (many other symptoms too) After many tests by my MD, I was sent to an Endocrinologist…he put me on an “Anti-Thyroid Drug (PTU) and ever since then my Candida simply went away. The moral of the story is…your Endocrine system can really “mess you up” (the Thyroid is consider the great Mimicker and Adrenal problems can also look like Candida) and I really want to encourage people to get tested by their Doctor for anything that could be causing the same symptoms we get from Candida. I had surgery to remove ½ of my thyroid 10-14-2010, and I’ve had zero symptoms of Candida ever since. I am still careful about what I eat and only have sugar as a “treat” So please go to your Doctor and get your Endocrine System tested…you might find out that you have a problem that is “fixable” in many holistic, simple ways, and you could feel so much better. PS. I am by no means suggesting that Candida isn’t it’s own disease, but I was not aware that thyroid/endocrine issues can cause it, and I’ll bet you didn’t know it either. Have a great day…and feel better."

I can confirm that in my case garlic and coconut have had the same effect on me!!"
0,bjgriffin,415,"Is Greek yogurt with honey a good probiotic to eat or does it cause more of the candida symptoms? I just started the 17 day diet in which you eat only chicken, fish, and turkey along with lots of fresh and steamed vegetables, lots of salad with a balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing, it also tells you to drink green tea. Each time I ate the fish I had a break-out of rash and blister like itchy sores on my hands and one foot. I used tea tree oil on my foot and it dried up the blisters but it has not helped with my hands. Could there be something in the fish (fresh salmon) (halibut) (canned tuna) that is causing my problem. Is the drink kefir a good probiotic? this diet has you eat a lot of citris fruit and apples… if anyone has any advice please let me know thanks"
1,sarah,415,"There are a few different versions of candida diets out there, and they don’t all share entirely the same guidelines. Based on the diet on this website, I’d make the following suggestions: Honey shouldn’t be eaten while you’re on a candida diet. It, along with other forms of sugar (even naturally sourced sugars) feeds the candida in a big way. Hold off on sugars until you have eliminated the overgrowth in your body. Both yogurt (Greek and American styles) and kefir do contain live probiotic cultures. Make sure you’re using plain unsweetened, rather than sugary, versions of these. If you are experiencing an allergic reaction to fish I would definitely recommend against eating it. Some people do have seafood allergies. Most fruits should be avoided at first (a bit of lemon or lime juice is okay) due to the high sugar content. Once you have eliminated the candida you can add fruits back in moderation, beginning with low sugar varieties. Most vinegars should be avoided on a candida diet, as well as other fermented and yeast-containing foods, as these promote the growth of candida in the body. Apple cider vinegar is the notable exception, which has antifungal properties. I highly recommend reading through the diet described on this website. There’s a lot of detailed information provided here. Best wishes!"
2,Whitney,415,Getting your probiotic in pill form instead of through yogurt is also an option that some people who are avoiding dairy prefer. Good luck! ~Whitney

0,noroomforlogic,416,"I am so relieved to finally have an idea of what this thing is that’s been wrong with me for most of my life. I have been suffering from Candida for almost twenty years and though I am recently only self diagnosed I have already seen a dramatic change in my symptoms over the past few months thanks in part to diet change and homeopathic remedies. Last fall I decided to go vegetarian and it was doubly the best and worst decision I could have ever made. The trifecta diet of cheese, mushrooms, and bread was the catalyst for gastrointestinal mayhem. After four months of the veggie diet and a month of stress from the big five areas of life (marriage, work, family, personal, finance) I had the worst outbreak I’ve ever had (spots in the front and a milky colored discharge from the back). The first time I had a major external outbreak was in 1994 when I was 15, though I’ve had an external sensitivity to ocean water since the time I hit adolescence. My parents had sold our house before closing on our new place and I had to live with my grandmother for a few months. I lesion popped up on my inner thigh which left about a three inch scar. I was embarrassed because of the location and didn’t ask for help at the time and since this was all before I was sexually active I was lost as to what this was or where it came from. It was also around this time that I noticed that sugar made it very painful to urinate. It became apparent that alcohol also had this affect on me when i got into college. It cropped up occasionally in high school (I only dated one girl in high school so she thought nothing of it) but through out college I was self-conscience and didn’t date much because of it. I was tested numerous times but none of the doctors knew what the spots were. The closest any doctor could get to a diagnosis was geriatric diabetes or maple syrup urine disease (from what I’ve read the only ailments that cause your urine to have the consistency of glue). Though I am self diagnosed I think the source of the problem was an anti-fungal regiment my former dermatologist had me on of Diflucan and Lotrimen when I was twelve years old. I have soft nails which she thought may have been a fungus. I attempted to retrieve my medical records but the hospital where my doctor was located closed it’s doors and destroyed it’s back log of medical records (it was over twenty years ago that I was on the medication). I recently had a stool test for yeast done which supposedly came back negative. The doctor told me I could seek a second opinion if I wanted to. This has been the reaction I have had from almost every doctor I have visited since I first experienced symptoms. The symptoms I have had most of my life include… * excessive fatigue * cravings for alcohol * anxiety * rectal itching * cravings for sweets * inability to think clearly or concentrate * hyperactivity * mood swings * hyperactivity * itching * eczema * depression * sinus inflammation * dizziness * poor memory * persistent cough * low sex drive * muscle weakness * irritability * learning difficulties * sensitivity to fragrances and/or other chemicals * cognitive impairment * sore throat I have also been prone to sinus infections and hemorrhoids since I was in my mid twenties. Again, no doctor made this connection. I realized that if the affected areas on my skin were tender and prone to bleeding then the same thing was probably happening on the inside. I have been sticking to the Candida Diet pretty strictly for the past few months but I’m convinced that I will be dealing with this ailment for a very long time if not for the rest of my life. Thank you so much for all of the information provided here. I am so grateful to have found the website and am doing my part to spread the word of healing through diet."
1,LolloRosso,416,"From what I have been reading, Drs don’t want to know because if everyone followed the diet, they’d be out of a job. I hope you can get through the first year and reclaim your life."
0,lillyflower,417,"hi, well i never new about this until recently a friend told me i might have it. back in 2002 i started getting really bad anxiety and yeast infections.. then i started having bad throat problems i was having sore throats a lot and white patches on my throat then the ent told me to just have my tonsils removed so i did. after that the problem kinda went away. i started getting really bad anxiety though and depression and ocd and i dont know if this is even linked but im saying it any way lol  my diet consists of a lot of carbs and sugar, im a over eater too. I also get very weird feeling like i want to jump out of my skin. constant body itching so i went to an allergist cause i also am having throat problems again. feeling like little bumps on the roof of my mouth. feels weird when i swallow sometimes like something is there. and i will get a hive here and there so i went to the allergist who tested me and i came up + for all these allergys i mean they are mild allergys but im shocked cause i never had a problem until the past year.  im 27 btw.  i tested + for corn, pork,,tomatos, wheat, strawberrys, gum, talc powder, bug reppelient, oranges. the oranges, strawberrys and corn is a 2+ allergy the rest is a 1 allergy and i cant seem to not eat this stuff i still am eating corn products, wheat and tomatoes and pork.  (i know dumb) so lately i been feeling like my tongue has a burnt feeling on it no matter what i eat it feels really sore and its bothering me. i also developed pcos from gaining weight this really sucks =("
1,Hope,417,"Hey, lillyflower 🙂 Well, no one on these boards can tell you for certain, but you do have quite a few symptoms associated with candida overgrowth. Your throat/tongue issues could possibly be thrush, which is just candida in your mouth. Docs can culture for this, and you’ll know for sure. *If* you have thrush, I’d say in combo w/ your other symptoms, you’re pretty likely to have candida issues. For me, thrush would be enough to get me on the diet seriously. As for the allergies, did you know that it’s very common to actually **crave** the foods to which you’re allergic? It makes sense that your biggest allergies are the ones that are the most diffult for you to drop. So, I’d get a culture done on your tongue/throat asap. If it’s thrush, I’d get on the diet ASAP. If not, I’d pursue the allergy thing for a little while and see how much avoiding your listed food helps and go from there. Hope it helps!"
0,doodle81,418,"I’ve been on an anti-Candida diet for about 2 months now. Before I started it, I had lots of stomach aches and diarrhea issues, along with immense fatigue and irritability, and weighed 261 lbs (I’m a 5’3″ woman). While the fatigue is still present in moderate amounts, and my husband will say my irritability is only slightly improved ;), my stomach and digestive issues vanished in the first couple of days on the diet. This leads me to believe I have allergies to dairy products (small amounts of non-aged cheese is okay for me), besides my body not being able to digest carbs/sugars well. Along with cutting out those things (including fruits, except for granny smith apples, which was hard for me!), I’ve been going to the gym about 3 times a week (great for getting toxins out of the body) and drinking distilled water – and lots of it! The supplements I’m taking include an anti-yeast once in the morning and once at night, 2 99-mg potassium capsules/day, oil of oregano and olive leaf extract supps. one at a time/twice a day in-between meals, ionic fizz magnesium (more easily digested in powder form), and probiotics (about 60 billion) just before bed. Those should be taken either one hour before meals or two hours afterward, and are best just before bed. With all that I’ve been doing (including diet and exercise I was doing on my own since the beginning of August), I have lost 38 pounds so far!! I’m so glad I found out all this information about my body and have found the strength to take the steps I needed to toward better health and quality of life. If you’re struggling with temptations (I have a wicked sweet tooth), you’re not alone. For my salty/crunchy cravings I have found black bean chips from my local health food store. Those with salsa are great! Make sure to read labels though, even things like salsa can have a lot of sugar in them. In recipes where you would use regular milk, use coconut milk instead. Use unsweetened if you can find it. Coconut is an amazing food. If you can, read ‘The Coconut Oil Miracle’. My husband read it and we immediately began using the oil in many meals. Hope this helps!"
1,kelandu,418,"thanks for the advice there. you are doing great. can i please ask you where you get the probiotics from? I cant seem to find any stronger than 3 billion.

0,mandaylyn2984,419,"Okay so I went on a vacation to Myrtle Beach back in June 2010. I came back with clogged ears, dizziness, nausea, sinus pains and pressure but no mucous. Went to the ER they said Sinusitis. I was on two different antibiotics inside of a month…soon after finishing them the symptoms still persisted and from there everything went down hill and I mean EVERYTHING!! I began missing my menstrual cycle, had no appetite lost about 35 lbs in a month and a half. I weighed 230 lbs and am down to 165, still experiencing symptoms. I’ve got constant fatigue, weakness, burning and tingling of the skin, hot sensations on my body frequently where I feel feverish but I have no fever I am actually cold and clammy. Anxiety for absolute no reason, sometimes I have trouble breathing and it throws me into a panic attack. Stiff joints/muscles…tenderness everywhere including my abdominal area. 24-7 stomach issues, gas, bloating, indigestion, nausea, pain in the left side where my rib is, feels almost like there is something swollen. My allergies are horrible! I’ve always had allergies but they were mild, I never had taken any allergy medication. Now it’s to the point where when I smell cologne, or go outside in the summer my nose instantly swells and I can’t breathe. I’ve been to the ER about 10 times in the past 9 months. They do Complete Blood Count with differentials, urinalysis, CT scan of head, CT scan of abdomen. So far all they have found was a low TSH for my thyroid but all other levels are normal. Doctor says thyroidtoxicosis where it fluctuates. Had an ultrasound on my thyroid it is perfect! A cyst on my left ovary which probably needs removed since it’s been there for a year. Doctors can’t find ANYTHING! I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and refused to take the pills because I know that is not what is causing what is going on. It’s not the anxiety that’s debilitating it’s the physical symptoms. I am 26 years old and should not be feeling like this. I can barely walk some days. My legs cramp up on me and turn purple when standing for long periods of time. I mean, I keep going to the ER because I feel like I am LITERALLY dying. Does this sound like  Candida to anyone? I mean it’s every part of my body my gums are even swollen. I did the at home Candida saliva test and it was positive but I don’t know how reliable that test actually is. My primary care doctor refused to test me for it because my Blood Count was normal and they can’t find anything. How do I state my case without doctors thinking I am looney? It’s like I have no ground to stand on because nothing shows up in blood work. I am scared…with this being left untreated it turns into more serious things down the road. What would you do? 🙁"
1,kelandu,419,"Hi there sounds like you are going through a terrible time. I have been the same, in my daairy I had over 50 sypmtoms over a year! its just awful. I was going to suggest you go to your gp to rule anything else out but you say youve been and had the same response I had, pointless! I dont think going on the candida diet can hurt you so at least giving it a try will show you whether you are right or wrong.  On the negative side you have to remember that things usually feel worse before they get better. I started the diet in December and im 80% better. Its been a long haul and Ive had some awful moments.  I dont have most of the symptoms any more and my energy is slowly rising. If I were you I would give it a go and stick to it. See how you get on but it will take about 6 weeks to see an improvement.  Just take time to get yourself better, you cant go on feeling that bad. Youve nothing to lose now by doing the candida diet x"
0,Kiss Of Dawn,420,"Ok…this is a long story, so bare with me. I’m a 20-year old college student, majorly healthy. I’ve never had any real major health issues, or extreme issues with candida. I have, in my past, had some gas issues and occasional stomach cramping, but nothing I couldn’t live with. It was always fixed with a little fiber and some water. Quite recently, over the summer (about 5-6 months ago), I decided to become healthier. I started trying to eat better and exercise more. I road my bike everywhere, did yoga, and walked a lot. I was in pretty good health. Then in September, I started taking birth control. I thought it might help my acne problem, but in the long run it ended up making it twice as bad. I got some frequent migraines months after taking it. My eyes would get blurry right before it happened. The migraines never lasted long, but the sure did bother me. About December, the Christmas rush hit. I’m a cashier in a retail store, so I was constantly working and extremely stressed out. I would get so tired from work, so I ate a lot of fast food because I didn’t want to make anything. I also stopped the yoga/exercise because I didn’t have a lot of time or energy to do it. I remember thinking to myself the last week of the holidays, “I’m going to get sick. I just know it.” I usually do, because the holidays always ware me out. Sure enough, the first week of January I get a sinus infection. That didn’t last long, and it went away on it’s own. About a week later, I started getting a pain in my right ear…which turned out to be tooth pain from a bottom molar that I cracked months before. It had never hurt before that. Apparently food had gotten inside and decayed, thus causing pain. I was taking some mild pain relievers to ease it. I went to the dentist and he said I had two options…I could get it pulled or get a root canal. I obviously chose to save the tooth. He then put me on some antibiotics and sent me on my way. I didn’t have any problems while I was on them, until about the last couple of days. I noticed after taking it, my cheeks would get a little red and I would feel warm. I never really put much though into, and continued taking it the last few days. Then after I stopped taking it, the same molar on the other side started hurting, which was also a little broken. So now I had two painful teeth on each side of my mouth. At that time I was in so much pain. I started taking some stronger painkillers, and if I wasn’t on the, I would be miserable. Only thing was that I felt really woozy on the painkillers, because they were so strong…but at least I didn’t feel the pain. A week after stopping the antibiotics, I got really sick at work. I felt faint and nauseated. I ended up going to the hospital, but they couldn’t tell me what was wrong. They assumed my teeth were infected and were poisoning me. I made an emergency appointment with my dentist, and he did the root canal on the first tooth and gave me more antibiotics. The next day I was soooo sick and in sooo much pain. I made another emergency appointment a few days later, he fixed the root canal tooth and gave me a lower dose of antibiotics. I felt a little better after that, but still not very good. I ended up getting both teeth pulled the following week. The first days were miserable because I couldn’t eat much, but then I started to feel better a little. The only problem was that I still felt extremely exhausted and my vision was hazy and very sensitive to light. Later that week, I stopped using my antibiotics because I thought I was having an allergic reaction. My face got really pink, I had a fever, my skin felt like it was burning, my tongue was yellow and fury, and my lymph nodes were a little swollen. I started feeling a little better after I stopped them. I finally decided to go online and find out what the hell was going on with me and why I still felt this way after my infected teeth were gone. Somebody had mentioned candida, and I seemed to have a good portion of the symptoms. It made complete sense. I never went to the doctor to find out, since I don’t have money/health insurance. I was positive it was what I had. I looked up how to get rid of it, and I saw something about the candida diet. At first I didn’t take it very seriously, because I was starting to get a little better (other than the fatigue). I thought since I was feeling better that I didn’t have to go on the strict diet. I would just take some probiotics, some garlic pills and some vitamin C, and it would all go away. Wrongo! I started back to work two weeks ago, and since then I’ve been feeling a bit worse. I started getting a little sinus infection and I was so tired that I could barely function. Then, about 3 days ago I actually started the candida diet. I stopped eating sugars and yeasty foods, and stuck to salads, proteins, lots of water, unsweetened Kifer (probiotic yogurt drink), and I started taking Culturelle. I’m also trying to work yoga back in. I felt really good the day I started it, but since then I’ve been really drained, my vision is fuzzy, and I crave food like CRAZY! I get really exhausted, especially after eating, and sometimes my skin gets tingly or warm. I don’t know if this is because I haven’t been sleeping as well lately, or because I’m experiencing some kind of die-off. I’m just really frustrated and stressed out. I feel like I’ve been walking in a daydream for two months. I hate it! All I want is my energy and my life back. I miss being able to concentrate and go out an have fun. I miss my friends so much, and I hate having to tell them I can’t see them because I’m too exhausted. I just want to feel alive again. I want to feel like my old, bubbly, hyper, happy self. It doesn’t help that this winter has been so long and depressing. Also, my 21st b-day is in two and a half months, and I’m going to be very disappointing if I can’t drink on the day I turn legal. I just need a little bit of encouragement, or any thoughts or advise. Thanks for listening…"
1,Kiss Of Dawn,420,"Ok, so now it’s day 4 of the candida diet. I went to work, still feeling very tired. It was freezing today! That definitely didn’t make me feel any better. My chest was in pain (especially left side), my nose was sniffly, my left arm was cramped and feeling numb. Is that die-off I’m experiencing? Is that normal? Do symptoms get worse when you’re cold? Just wondering…"
2,kelandu,420,"you poor thing , your going through a really hard time. I cant say you have candida but the fact you tried the diet and felt worse tells me you may have. Its amazing what it can do to you. All I can say is stick to it if you can because if you are right then you will heal in time. Im on week 13 of the diet and I only started getting my health back 10 weeks ago. Its a tough one to get through but you are not alone. Keep strong, you are on the right track love kelly"
3,Kiss Of Dawn,420,"Thank you! I appreciate the comment! Any encouragement is definitely needed. I’m a baby when it comes to illness. lol! Today(day 5) I started out not feeling so well, especially when I was at school. I finally went to the bathroom, since I have been a bit constipated since I started the diet. When I went, I noticed clear fluid coming from my vaginal area. I think that’s a good thing, though…according to my research. My tongue is still a bit yellow and furry in the back, but the front is clearing up a bit. After my classes were over, I decided to hit the cafeteria. They really didn’t have a whole lot of options for me to eat. I ended up bending my diet a little and had a yogurt parfait…it consisted of yogurt, cinnamon granola, and a couple blueberries on top. I thought it couldn’t hurt. I had a little hard time swallowing the granola, since my throat has been a bit sore lately. Then somehow I felt a little better after eating it…weird. I actually felt good enough to go to the grocery store and shop for more food for myself. I bought coconut oil (I heard it kills candida), some unsweetened almond milk, more yogurt, some herbal tea, and more cinnamon granola. I even stopped at the salad bar and ate a delicious anti-candida meal. When I came home, I went for an hour and a half walk. It was very chilly out, but I bundled up real good. I very much enjoyed the fresh air, especially since I’ve been cooped up inside all winter. I ran into my mom’s friend on the walk, and turns out she’s going through the same thing. She took some antibiotics and ended up with a candida infection…go figure! She told me she used Colloidal(sp?) Silver. She said it cleared her up real fast. I’m thinking about looking in to it. This could help me! I’m hoping this “good” feeling is a sign I’m getting better and not just a temporary thing. Wish me luck!"
4,kelandu,420,"you sound really determined to get through this which is great, so many fall at the first hurdle. All the awful symptoms you get on the diet are usually die off and once you get through that it gets a little better each day. Stick to it. im glad I found the info I needed cause no doctor believes this is real and how much it can take from you. Ive never tried the silver but heard good reports from others that have. Its amazing how luch you change on this diet, you see ‘normal’ food as poisons and start looking at better ways to eat for good. I dont think i will ever touch a macdoanlds again lol. The worse bit is traveling because there are so few places where you can eat so i just eat before i go or take a packed lunch. very annoying lol . x"
5,Kiss Of Dawn,420,"Yeah, finding food to eat has become an adventure for me…especially at the college cafeteria. Although, today they did have a pretty good medley of stuff to eat. I had chicken with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Pretty tasty! Also, I made a breakfast combo this morning. I put my granola in a bowl(I have become addicted to granola!), poured the Kefir yogurt on top, and sprinkled flax seeds on it. It was AMAZING! Dinner was a little more challenging, seeing as I only had an hour to go home, eat, change, and leave for work…so all I had was canned green beans and unsweetened almond milk. I also bought some of that colloidal silver today. It’s a throat spray that you take once a day. I really hope it works. I did feel a bit better today, especially since it’s been so sunny out. That definitely helps. Well…off to work!"
6,kelandu,420,"let me know how you get on with the collodial silver. Ive not tasted granola yet but will try that i think. You will look back one day and realise you have completely changed the way you view food. i do now lol. I feel sick when i see greasy burgers and im glad I eat better, it can only help in the long run x"
7,Kiss Of Dawn,420,"So, it’s almost been two weeks since I started the diet. I’m starting to feel a little improvement, but I still get tired and foggy-minded/visioned yet. Since taking the colloidal silver, my thrush is looking much better. I still have a little yeast and some red bumps on the back of my tongue, but I’m hoping it will go away soon. I have to admit, I did cheat last Friday. I went to a birthday party and had a slice of pizza. It didn’t make me feel too bad, other than some indigestion…but I probably shouldn’t have eaten it nonetheless. It was either eat that or starve. I do find myself craving chocolate, especially with all the stores filled to the brim with Easter candy. I also crave pastry-type stuff…muffins, danishes, pies. Also pasta, but that’s only because I’m a HUGE pasta eater. I’ve been going on walks a lot, since the weather has been a bit more pleasant. Unfortunately it’s not going to stay that way, since we’re getting snow later this week. Looks like it’s going to be a cold Spring break.  It’s been a slow recovery, but I’m hoping that the worst is over with now…granted I don’t cheat too much. It’s really hard no to, though. I live with my dad, and all he eats is junk food, so it’s always there staring me in the face, taunting me. “Eat me, eat me!” lol! I’m trying my best to hold my ground, but I’m not sure how much longer I can stand this diet. Although I have become highly addicted to yogurt and granola, I’m starting to get sick of salads and veggies. Don’t get me wrong, I love veggies…but I need some more flavor! It wouldn’t be so bad if I could eat potatoes. I love potatoes! I just want to be able to eat normally again. It’s not like I eat junk food all the time, I mean I’m kind of a health nut as it is…but this diet is ridiculous. I’ve lost so much weight, and I’m tiny! I think I only weigh 98lbs right now. I used to weigh 110. My friends are concerned for me because they say I look sick. It’s scary. I need to pile on some more weight, but I can’t with this “thing” inside me. But hey, what am I gonna do. All I can do is be patient and wait it out. I guess I’ll get by."
8,jereseib,420,"Just hang in there. I wouldnt worry too much about losing weight. I found that once my body started digesting better that the weight will come back. You can also try things such as avocados, almonds, and beef to up your calorie intake. These are all high calorie foods that are allowed on the diet. Good luck!"
9,carrotflowers,420,"Hi there! I have somewhat of a similar story (although yours sounds a little more extreme!) I had severe tonsilitis from last August until the end of November, when I eventually had them taken out. Before and after surgery, I was on several rounds of antibiotics, which then gave me oral thrush when recovering from surgery. I took a prescribed antifungal for it, but it never seemed to go away… I kept getting sick, had to stay home from work for several days each month, and miss out on lots of get-togethers with friends. I assumed I was still recovering from the surgery, even though five months had passed. So I finally diagnosed myself, and have been sugar-free for almost two weeks, and feel amazingly better. I didn’t feel like I experienced “die off” since my symptoms were beginning to flare up anyway… but I did feel way more tired and foggy, had cold/sinus symptoms, and lots of breakouts on my face. All of those things went away on the 7th or 8th day. I am getting a little antsy though, and sick of salads! (I’m also dreading Easter, when my family has the habit of over-stocking sweets…) Something that I found also helps is keeping a journal of what you’ve been eating and doing to help, and what your symptoms have been each day. Being able to look back and see the progress you’ve made is super helpful, and motivating! If you can handle it, start out with some sort of mild exercise, and work your way up to some cardio about 3 times a week. It really makes a difference energy-wise, and helps sweat away the toxins! I think this website is great, and with the help of everyone’s support and motivation, we’ll be able to stick to it! Best of luck! xx"
0,Jennifer,421,"I’m 40 years old and have had yeast infections on and off since I was 20. For 20 years I’ve suffered from depression, fatigue, dizziness, ears itchy, ringing, vaginal yeast; all the symptoms making me miserable. I’ve gone to countless doctors who couldn’t help me. I’ve done this to myself by eating a diet high in sugar and starchy carbs. I’m finally curing this with diet; supplements and antifungals. Trust me, coming from someone who’s had this for 20 years, I’m curing myself and my symptoms are disappearing. Every day I eat protein, veggies and fat; not starchy veggies(no potatoes, yams, carrots,beats) take antifungals…virgin coconut oil; 2 tablespoons a day and whole cloves of garlic, 4 a day, crushed and mixed into a glass of water(garlic tonic) take supplements to boost your immune system: vitamin A, D, C and zinc.  Stay on this for months and don’t cheat. I feel very clear, very alert, not depressed; like a giant fog has been lifted.  But don’t cheat: no grains, no wine, no cheese, no chocolate; no starch. I find when I cheat, the symptoms come back immediately. Good luck!!"
1,whyitsme,421,"Only thing is if you are dealing with leaky gut, like I am, then supplements don’t do any good, since body not absorbing them."
2,kelandu,421,"hi I am doing exactly what you are doing. Unfortunatley i changed my diet 9 weeks ago and have been constipated for 3 weeks. I have an impacted colon. I believe I got this after trying candida clear supplements and the die off was severe, i probably had a toxic die off landing in my colon. My digestion is terrible and I am so ill. I have to admit that if I fell off the wagon i would feel 10 times worse so Im glad Im able to stick with it. I just wish i had realised in advance the dangers of sudden die off. Im under the doctor now and i pray the treatment will work.  I have lost 2 and a half stone so far and I actually look much better and my skin is lovely so it as showed its advantages is some ways. Do you plan to stick with this permanently or are you going to reintoduce foods in the future? I want to stick to this and have the odd treat when i can . I love garlic but I have severe stomach pain after eating it even capsules react badly , shame ."
3,4evryoung,421,"Stage 1 has been really successful for me. I nixed the detox so the die-off is probably more gradual and I’ve had few side effects. Rather than the detox I’m taking an herbal supplement that helps to promote die-off only at a slower pace. I’ve found the foods in Stage 1 very satisfying and have had little or no sugar cravings. In a little less than 3 weeks I’ve lost 13lbs. I haven’t counted calories but have noticed since cutting out the sugars and processed foods that my appetite has been cut in half. I think I’m going to continue the herbs for a second month and try to keep eating according to stage 1 before reintroducing foods, although I may increase the quantities I eat to sustain an exercise program."
4,Terrylee5151,421,"I also had candida… AND LEAKY GUT. I thought it was the candida coming back so I went for a blood test plus they did a resistance test. No Candida. Then, after much reading and searching, I discovered I must have leaky gut. I have the whole post on my blog if you are interested in reading it. I did get rid of the leaky gut. http://myjourneywithcandida.blogspot.com/2010/11/healing-my-leaky-gut-or-my-digestive.html I also have a lot of other problems caused by candida that I am working on. I am feeling so much better though."

0,koruflame,422,I got all the way to Stage 3 started on the Anti fungals and then had 5 days of cheating every day!!! Really suffering for it now all my original symptoms have come back with a vengance!! Do I need to start right from the fast again and stop the anti fungals ? Any advice anyone?
1,kelandu,422,"I made a couple of mistakes because i tried tomatoes and oatsd and reacted badly. It depends on you on how long it affects you. i was ill for a few days each time. Dont give in. the fat you made a mistake and got ill means you will be more determined to stick to it in future. you have done well so far and a few mistakes just gives you the boost you need to avoid those foods like the plague lol. I know i dont crave tomatoes any more lol. stick with the antifungals, they will work, just be stricter with yourself from now on. you can do it! love kelly"
2,Whitney,422,I agree – just don’t let it derail you from getting back on track. As far as how strict you need to be or whether you need to start over would probably just depend on the severity of your current symptoms. If even some of the stage 2 or stage 3 food items are causing flare ups you know you probably need to be a little more strict until it is back under control. Good luck! ~Whitney
0,kaye,423,"hi just wondering what your thoughts on stevia and vegetable glycerine are on the anti candida diet ? am i best avoiding these or are they ok , be really grateful for any advice thanks very much 🙂 xx"
1,kelandu,423,"Hi Kaye, I use stevia all the time, its brilliant. I make puddings using gluten free flour and stevia, it is perfect as is ziloton? ( spelling lol) , Not sure about the veg glycerine though , sorry  kelly"
2,lbkio897,423,"Hi Kelly, I use liquid stevia sometimes but it is an aquired taste. I just recently started using Yacon syrup which looks and tastes like molasses and is acceptable to use on the Candida diet. It is also a prebiotic. I ordered it from nutsonline.com -Brandi"
0,All68,424,"I have been yeast free since July 5th 2010! It feels AWESOME! A bit of history on why I went yeast free… In March 2010 i was Diagnosed with Vitiligo, I was told that the patches would get worse under stress and you need will need to be anti- anxiety RX and Steroid creams to keep it under control. This was a stressful time for me, but in know way did i feel that this was my answer. But i did what they said and added new RX’s to what I was already taking for Allergies, & Migraines. I lived this way until about June, then started wanting to know WHY I got Vitilitgo.. no real answer, but I have learned alot.. It is an Auto-Immune Issue. So my focus then became to improve my immune system. I learned fast, that we live in a world full of toxins and everything we come in contact with and eat can effect our immune system. I came across this website, and several others. After that i was even more convinced that Yeast played a roll in my immune system being off balance…  I was on BCP for 20 years I had a major case of C-diff and was on Anti-bioitcs for 3 months straight  had Steriod injections for my knee ( 3xtimes the year before i got Vitiligo) This is just the short list By this time i was ready. We had a big party planned on the 4th, so i ate what ever i wanted on that day .. the next day i went cold turkey and quit anything that created yeast in my system. The die-off was pretty bad for a week! At that time i was glad i still have my Migriane RX The next week was better and each week after that was great, my energy level was something i had not had since in my 20’s by the 30 day mark, My husband, starting noticing my dark circles were lighter and i was happy, and I had lost some weight It just kept getting better…  I stopped taking all of my RX’s… I no longer feel nervous that my Migraine rx is not filled….  2.5 months into it, we went on vacation and I wore a bikini (something I have not worn since my honeymoon) I managed to eat clean on vacation and loved it… So now, here i am…. 4 months into eating yeast free… No wiling to go back, but wondering where to go now… I know that my food box is small and with the holidays around the corner, wondering what a bit of clean baked goods would do (almond flour and Agave) Any words of wisdom on going forward…  If i do eat something that has a bit of sugar or wheat, will it bring it all back? Thanx for any comments A"
1,kelandu,424,"Hi there you have come a long way, well done! Im on week 14 of the diet and to be honest I still have bad days. I wanted sugar again but was too scared to take it so I got some stevia and xlitotol (spelling) and I use that to make puddings. Also I found some gluten, wheat free flour which is great so i can bake now. I make rice puddings too which are delicious using brown rice, vanilla essence and rice milk with a bit of stevia and cinamon.  we all take different times to fully recover and they advice you to stick to the diet where poss but reintroduce once thing at a time and see how you get on.  Are you back on fruit yet? Im not, I had an apple a few weeks back and went crazy lol. I think you could experiment with the foods you can eat .  I bake egg custard, puddings, biscuits using the flour and unsalted butter etc.  Just do one small step at a time and see how you do. But keep a food diary then if you have something that makes you feel dodgy then tick it off the not to eat list for a while then reintroduce it back at a later date.  If you do this and you are fine then let us know what you were ok with, i cant wait to expand my food list too lol x"
0,Eileen40,425,"In mid-October, I was rushed to the hospital. I would have died without treatment, which included surgery, five days of intravenous antibiotics, and another five days of oral antibiotics. Knowing that I was down, my sister sent chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate. Typical symptoms started. The white coating on my tongue disturbed me the most, because I could no longer eat the hot foods I loved. The day after Thanksgiving, I half-heartedly started a GFCF diet to battle what I had determined was Candiditis. On December 7th, I found this place and refined the diet to conform to what was listed here. I started eating only dry salads with sardines, avocados with ground garlic, thin broccoli soup, and a little meat. I drank a lot of water. Two days into the diet, I thought I was going to die from the lesions, the pain, and the itching. I scratched myself raw. I became very depressed, but could not afford to see a doctor for the ‘magic yeast killing pill’ about which my friends told me. (Other part of the story: I was a career SAHM for 23 years who is now getting a divorce while soon-to-be-ex sits in detention awaiting trial. Medicaid denied my claim for the hospital visit, and they have been calling me. Can you spell S-T-R-E-S-S?) I cried a lot. I discovered that Palmer’s Cocoa Butter Lotion eased the itching. I kept a picture of my children in my head. I reminded myself that the diarrhia had quit, that my tongue looked normal, and that the brain fog was lifting. My children helped encourage me. Others who had been through it also sent encouragement. Then, one day, December 16th, the violent itching stopped! The fog completely lifted! The day was worth living! Woohoo! The diet works! I still have stages 2 and 3 to complete, but if you are wondering if it is worth it, consider this my testimony. Do the diet EXACTLY as listed. You have to starve those little beasties to death! My diet was boring, but it was also easy on the pocketbook. You can do anything for three weeks when you have a goal in mind. Health feels good."
1,kelandu,425,"well done Eileen. I think i was like you, I got so ill and so desperate I was willing to try anything. The diet works in time its getting over the die off. Im on week 14 and generally doing better but its so hard isnt it? I find if i have something that doesnt agree with me I itch like crazy too. get well soon x"
0,josh777,426,"Hello. My name is Josh. I’m avoiding starting this journal because I’ve done journals like this before, and once i’ve gotten started it’s difficult to stop until there’s been some indication of success. There’s no turning back now. I’ve probably had some form of candida overgrowth for a decade or more. I’ve had the symptoms of a mild oral thrush for years now, and I originally had a problem with tinea versicolor for the first time a dozen years ago. Tinea versicolor is a minor fungus which populates the skin of people with weakened immune systems, those who live in high humidity areas, or those who eat yeasty, sugary foods, and consume alcohol. So it’s related to candida, I’m sure. I’ve been stressed out lately, and my diet has probably had a slight increase in processesed, sugary foods. Stress lowers the immune system, and I’ve been pretty stressed this fall and winter. I have a good deal of mercury in my head with quite a few teeth with old metallic fillings. The mercury kills off good bacteria, while my high sugar, high alcohol, high bread and cheese consumption diet created the perfect environment for an overgrowth of candida. I thought i was a healthy guy, and overall I am in pretty good shape. I’ve been vegetarian for the last few years, and I’ve done periodic fasting, as well. I’ve done the “Master Cleanse,” lemonade fast on three occasions for extended amounts of time. The “Master Cleanse” is great, aside from the fact that it’s built to funnel food to candida. The saltwater flush part of this diet, which is a quart of saltwater to be drank every morning to clear the colon offsets some of the sugar. It must clear some of effects of the maple syrup, and my tongue was clear after finishing this fast/diet, but vegetable juice fasts are superior to the “Master Cleanse” in that they avoid feeding candida. So, while I’ve done difficult food regimens before, I was always able to incorporate some sugar in there. Sugar is the one bad habit that I’ve never kicked. Caffeine, meat, dairy, alcohol, and more have been excluded from my diet at one time or another. Never has sugar been excluded from my diet. This is a very difficult challenge for me, and I empathize with people who have such horrible times kicking substances like tobacco, and heroin. Anyway, I’ve had tinea versicolor, which is known as “sun spots,” “haole rot,” or just as a skin fungal infection, for a few months now. I’ve dealt with it before, and over the course of the last decade I’ve learned to use “Selsun Blue” as a body wash and let that 1% selenium sulfide keep away any sun spots. But lately the spots began to expand, and I’ve got it on my head, too. I’ve had tinea versicolor this bad when I lived in tropical weather, but not in my current mediterranean climate. So, anyway, here I am pretty much ignoring that I’ve got candida, my girlfriend had been telling me so for months, and I’m worried about the tinea versicolor. I go to the doctor and request an antifungal to kill the TV. I fill my prescription of 4 150 mg pills of Fluconazole. I take 3 of them, 450 mgs. Then I go hike a few miles to get the sweat pouring out so the Fluconazole will come out through my skin and kill the TV. A few days pass. My skin has pale, circular spots on new locations on my forearms and back. I check my tongue and it’s got a thicker than usual white coating. The candida and TV took a hit from that 450 mg of Fluconazole, and I had some die-off headaches, but It wasn’t enough to kill my seemingly systemic fungal problem, and it came back with a vengeance. Now it all sinks in. The TV and candida are related, and the bad bacteria are winning the battle big time down in my gut. I haven’t had other fungal problems like jock itch, or foot or hand fungi. My thrush is not as gnarly as some of the pictures you see online. And sometimes it’s really hard to tell if you have “fuzzy thinking,” “depression,” or “lack of energy,” or to what extent those things might be attributable to candida. It’s hard to say. So basically I’m thinking I have a moderately severe problem with candida, but it’s not exactly incurable and life-threatening. Today’s the 17th. I took those Fluconazole pills on the 4th. It’s been a couple weeks, and i’ve started a little program to fight the fungus. Here’s what I’ve been doing: Vitamins & Herbs: Now “Candida Clear” Caprylic Acid, Pau D’Arco, Black Walnut, and Oregano Oil. Along with Biotin. Source Naturals “Life Flora” 3 Billion Cells. Source Naturals “Sugar Ban” Gymnema sylvestre, Grapefruit Pectin, Pullulan, and a little Lactobacillus. Planetary Naturals “Candida Digest” Bai-Zhu, Atractylodes Rhizome, Asafetida Gum, Resin, Caraway Seen, Cumin Seed, Ginger Root, Long Pepper fruit, Black Pepper Fruit, Slippery Elm Bark, Dandelion Root, and Rock Salt. Now “4×8 Probiotics” 8 Billion Live Cells. Tea: Pau D’Arco and Peppermint tea. Diet: Bad Things: I have eaten a half a loaf of sprouted wheat bread. It has yeast in it. I ate some cheese and tortillas last week. I was using mustard to eat veggie dogs with sauerkraut. I also ate about 6 wheat buns. I had a bunch of tofu. Good Things: I haven’t drank any wine or beer or hard liquor in two weeks. Sea Vegetables Apple Cider Vinegar and water to chug down cloves of garlic every day. I’ve eaten a quite a bit of yogurt. 2 kombucha teas. Been drinking more water. Exercise & Detox I’ve surfed a couple of times. Baths with “Selsun Blue” in the water along with Epsom Salts, and Lime Oil. I’ll update soon. Today it looks like the white coating on my tongue has lessened a little bit."
1,josh777,426,"Journal Post #2 12-20-10 Ok. I’ll give a quick little update. Everything seems to be going very well. How I’m mainly judging my candida is by my white tongue. Elimination will be a good way to gauge how the ecology inside my gut is going. And then, I guess I will be able to tell that I feel better overall. But, mostly I’m focusing on my tongue. I may have a problem with candida only to the extent that it produces thrush in the mouth, but that’s probably a little unrealistic. I bet it’s as bad in my gut as in my mouth, and the main focus of this all is getting the candida that lives in gut back into balance. So, that being said, my tongue is looking better. It no longer has the white coating on the tip and there is an area in the middle back that has also cleared up, and is looking nice and pink. I’m assuming that I’m succeeding, and I’m just going to keep going on the path that I’m on and add in some new treatments to do the job as well as possible. New treatments: Sodium Bicarbonate, otherwise known and baking soda. I’m taking it internally, and a good amount in my baths. One bath I added Selsun Blue, Epsom Salt, Baking Soda, and even some Apple Cider Vinegar. Then in another bath I added some old Barley Grass that had a expiration date of a year prior. But the main thing to note is the 1/4 teaspoon of Baking Soda that I drink with water or water with Apple Cider Vinegar and Lemon. This is all to increase my alkalinity. New treatment: I’ve been using Desenex powders on my skin to discourage or eliminate the fungus tinea versicolor. On this point it seems that i’m improving with the TV, too. It’s hard to tell though because whether you kill all the TV or not you will still have white spots for a month or two because the fungus emits a bleach byproduct that temporarily discolors the skin. But, I can watch to see if the spots move to new places, and I have to say, yes, they did. But that seems to possibly be a die-off thing because right after I took the Fluconazole, a few weeks ago, they got worse. But now I haven’t seen any new spots for the last few days, and it seems like the color is blending back no normal in some areas, but it can be hard to tell sometimes, too. So, in sum, I’m pretty happy with everything right now. It seems like I’m slowly but surely killing all the candida, and replacing it with probiotics. I’ve doubled my probiotics today, taking 4 pills a day instead of the recommended 2. This ups my count to 24 billion. Then I take two other vitamins that add about 3 or 4 billion more. I’ve been trying to get lots of rest, and keep my stress low. Big change of diet. This diet can be ridiculously hard. It seems like there is nothing to eat. I realize how much I used to rely on cheeses and breads and sweets. I ate a crapload of carbs. I’ve been a vegetarian for over 3 years now, and I see that although I have improved my diet overall, I make up for the exclusion of meat by substituting the inclusion of way too many carbs, and processed sweets, and all that junk. Also one of my favorite things is simply some red wine with bread and cheese. I suppose I have a touch of French in me, and this is a classic combo, but that is way too much yeast and alcohol. I’m a fairly consistent drinker of beer and wine and spirits in general. I tend to drink at least a little bit probably 5 days out of the week. Not to the point of being drunk, but small portions regularly. So I’m a vegetarian, I get on this candida diet, then I realize that there’s nothing for me to eat. I just bought a bunch of tofu, oops, can’t eat that. No vinegar so that takes out all the condiments and dressings. When I first started this diet I was eating veggie hot dogs with whole wheat buns and mustard and sourkraut. It took me a while to realize, uh oh, can’t eat these buns. Oops, no veggie hot dogs. Oh man, I can’t even be eating this mustard, it has vinegar in it. When I finally discovered exactly what you can and can’t eat I felt a bit worried because I wasn’t sure how I was going to get my nutrition. I decided I should go back to eating meat while on this diet, just to make it easier by having more options and easier to get a balanced diet. Then of course I mess up. I buy spicy sausages. They were better tasting than the veggie dogs, but then I realized I shouldn’t have bought such a processed food, with plenty of bad stuff in it. Up next was a package of round chuck steaks. But then I realized I need to get meat that is organic and cleaner. But these meats will do for now. I realize it can seem impossible at times to follow the diet exactly, but I think it’s ok to not be perfect and the focus should not only be eliminating yeasts and sugars from the diet, but killing candida with meds or supplements, and then taking billions and billions of probiotics to overwhelm the ratio in my stomach. So it’s a three-pronged attack, and there are different ways to be effective. I figure protein, fresh veggies, water, plain natural yogurt, sourkraut are the main parts of my diet right now, and the main things to avoid or sugar, alcohol and yeast. I try to look at it simply and not stress too much when I mess up. For instance, I’ve had a few pieces of Ezekial sprouted wheat bread over the last few days. It contains yeast, but it’s probaly a third as yeasty as Wonder Bread, or something like that, and I don’t think it’s going to ruin things entirely. In fact everything seems to be doing fine as I’ve done it so far. Pretty soon I’m going to get a high powered Grape Seed Extract, and some Clove Oil, and maybe some Oil of Oregano. I’ll start cycling through these. But first I need to finish off the candida products I already have. I’ll probably start just upping my dosages a bit on all my vitamins that I already have to really flood my body with them, and finish them off. I’ll try to post again soon."
2,josh777,426,"Journal Post #3 12-21-10 I guess I shouldn’t make it seem like peaches n’ cream. I was able to get my tongue pretty clean and pink last night because the white coating is going down generally, and I also brushed my tongue with baking soda, which cleared it up pretty quick. But when I checked this morning there was a thin white coating across my whole tongue again. So I think I’m going to have to daily brush my tongue. I also have a tongue scraper that I rarely use. Also on my left and right arms right below my shoulders I have either dry skin or a different kind of fungus. There are patches of peeling skin that look like they might be a fungus. If it’s dry skin it’s probably just a reaction to all the baths I’ve been taking with “Selsun Blue” or all the baking soda and epsom salt. I don’t know if this is die-off or a new problem to deal with."
3,Eileen40,426,"I have had similar patches, but they itched. At times, they felt like scars. I used very hot water, then cocoa butter on them. After die-off, they went away."
4,josh777,426,"Thanks, Eileen. Actually, I don’t think they are as bad as when I typed my last post. My left arm had a pretty good area of the dry, flaky skin. It didn’t really itch, though. Yesterday I used a plastic loofah to gently scrub and exfoliate my skin, especially in that spot (with Seslun Blue and another gentle body wash). When I checked that area out later it looked better. Less flaky skin. So I think it’s a passing thing with the die-off, or something. The body can do weird stuff in a healing crisis, like cleanse old toxins through skin. My tongue is doing really well, and looks pretty darn clear. I think the gargling and brushing the tongue with baking soda really deals with oral thrush quickly and effectively. But I don’t want to get too overconfident and start eating the wrong foods yet. I’m going to assume that it will take longer to get enough good bacteria deep in my gut, and all the candida out. I’ll try to err on the safe side. But another good looking sign is my elimination. It’s a clear indicator of how you are digesting, and how your stomach flora is doing. Mine have improved, and are consistent. That’s a great sign. My body has adjusted to eating meat really well. There have been maybe 5 or so occasions over the last few years where I have eaten meat. It usually involves me feeling impolite or rude not to eat what is offered to me. So, I really haven’t had many occasions for my stomach to readjust to the stomach acids that dissolve meat. But my body has reacted splendidly, with one period right at the start where I was having really bad cramps and gas, and even headaches. That was right at the start when I first took the Fluconazole, and started on the new diet. I think the probiotic foods and supplements are really helping. I’ve said in my earlier posts how I have fasted before, and have dealt with food cravings. Well, two things: First, I’ve had a food dream again. In this dream I was eating chocolate and 3/4 of the way through realized that it was something I wasn’t supposed to eat. I reacted in a panic, then woke up. I used to have these types of dreams when I was doing the Master Cleanse. Funny. Also, it’s the holdidays and everyone has some damn delicious looking cookies. There were some that magically appeared at my job this morn. Very difficult to avoid, but I did. I covered them with my jacket while I was at work."
5,josh777,426,"Journal Post #5 12/24/10 Ok. Quick update: Everything is going pretty good. The dry skin or skin fungus on my upper arms pretty much went away with a couple gentle scrubs in the bath. My bath combination is Selsun Blue, Epsom Salt, Baking Soda, Barley Grass (expired), and some lavender and lime oil. I’m doing this to deal with the tinea versicolor fungus on my skin, as I’ve said before. So, here’s the thing that really sucks about tinea versicolor: You can’t tell when it’s dead. The spots it creates are bleaching of the skin from a fungal byproduct, and even once you’ve killed the TV it still takes a few months for the pigment of the skin to slowly blend the skin tone. So right now I’m pretty much sure that I’ve killed it, it’s not growing; but I can’t be totally sure, and that bugs the crap out of me. But it seems like it’s blending back slowly but surely, and it’s not growing anymore. I think the growth period was just a die-off effect that lasted for about a week after I took the Fluconizaole. It’s hard to tell whether it is the diet changes or probiotics or the candida killer vitamins or the Fluconazole that have been so effective curing the oral thrush I had on my tongue. But I’m guessing that the Fluconazole gave the fungus a big hit, but couldn’t kill it, and the other ingredients combined have given me results so far. But, like I said a minute ago, I can’t be totally sure about the TV, but my tongue is still nice and clear, and it does feel like I have a bit more energy. Then again, I’m not drinking now either, so that may be having an effect. I’m sure it is. I was not a huge drinker, but a regular one. I recently went to a large natural foods store and saw that there are enzyme supplements that break down the cell wall of candida, and kill it that way. They use high amounts of cellulose, protease, and amalyse to kill candida. I had read about “cell wall” supplements for candida I wasn’t exactly sure what the ingredients were. Now that I understand this method I really like the sound of it, and think you could probably deal with candida with just “cell wall enzymes,” probiotics, and by excluding sugar. Anyway, I’m too broke to buy them right now. I also wanted to buy liquid GSE Grape Seed Extract, but I’ll have to wait on that, as well. I did end up buying some clove powder to make tea. I had bought some more Pau’D Arco tea a few days prior. I’ve been eating meat and my digestion and elimination have been good. I haven’t been taking the baking soda or garlic internally the past couple days. I realized one thing about taking baking soda internally: don’t take it right after eating or with any food in the stomach. It disarms all the acidity of the stomach which is needed to break down foods, and you’ll have your food sit there and possibly some indigestion. I ate a couple of pieces of pizza today. It had yeast in the dough and probably vinegar in the tomato sauce, not to mention cheese. I avoided drinking a coca cola. This was pure weakness on my part with respect to the pizza; I shouldn’t have eaten it. Oh well, my attitude is this: I’m in it for the long haul, so I need to take the long view, and make changes slowly but steadily. If I were to be too perfect it would make me more likely to blow it on one gorgefest freakout. Also I’m not relying exclusively on the diet, I still think probiotic massive attack is the best route as of right now. Happy Holidays."
6,apctech,426,"I wouldn’t beat yourself up too much over straying off the Candida diet. I’ve found that it’s almost impossible for me to keep, especially when eating out. By the way, what was the name of the cell wall enzyme that you saw at the natural foods store? I would be interested in looking into it. Merry Christmas!"

8,apctech,426,"Wow, that Candex is expensive stuff – $32.79 for 120 capsules. I’ll have to think a long time and do some research on it before ordering. I wonder how many doses it takes before results are seen. I’ve tried Grapeseed Extract, but it didn’t do much for me. Maybe it’ll help you. Everyone’s unique when it comes to Candida."
9,kelandu,426,"Hi Josh thanks for sharing your journal. I have spent hours trawling the internet for some advice. It seems most of it comes from people trying to sell products so it is biased. I finished a week course of antibiotics 2 weeks ago for h pylori. I have been off work since november because i was so poorly. The antibiotics wiped me out but i was hopefull I was cured. Sadly I have ended up with a bad case of candida. I have no trust in medicene, they just through pills at the symptoms without discovering the cause.  My partner got me some fluconazole but I have a bit of a phobia about meds I have never taken so I wont take it. In the meantime i have ordered some candida clear and am waiting for it to come. I have been eating 2 cloves of garlic a day , this gives me a bit of tummy ache after but I want to believe its because it works lol. Yesterday i started mixing crushede garlic in a tablespoon of olive oil. all I can say is I had 3 seconds to get to the loo lol.  I changed my diet 7 weeks ago because i read on the h pylori site that i should cut out all sugars, gluten and dairy. I also drink lots of water now. to be honest I dont feel any better for it but then i am a negative thinker and tend to dwell on every symptom and let it drag me down.  My symptoms are exhaustion, although I have started to sleep more than i hqve in 10 months ( h pylori gave me insomnia amongst other things). I get awful stomach pain after eating and get short of breath even sitting down, heartburn is there but not to the point of taking meds for it, I was on omeprazole for years then I read its the cause of problems if taken long term grrr. I also get anxious and irritable and cant think straight. my throat is quite sore and i have thrush down below.  Im just hoping that you and everyone else on here gets well. this is a really awful thing to put up with. Ive had a pretty rubbish christmas. I used to be a chocoholic lol now I cant even touch it. keep us informed with your progress because it helps other people too. x"
10,kelandu,426,"ps I forgot to add that I have been taking manuka honey ( until I read its not good for candida) and apple cider vinegar. Now I must warn people that the acv has rottede my teeth, I have 5 teeth decaying, Im holding out for the dentist till I feel better. just be warned that after taking acv you should rinse your mouth with water because its acidic. Im thinking maybe i just drink it with a straw and just let it go straight down so it doesnt touch my teeth. I also use bicarb when i get heartburn it sees it off straight away."
11,josh777,426,"hi kelandu. I’ll reply to you then do my update post. First off, I’m sorry you’re having such a rotten Christmas. I hope 2011 is much better for you. I looked up h pylori to see that it’s a type of stomach bacteria. I think between that, and the antibiotics, and the candida, and the fact that you have been on meds for extended time in the past, and the fact that you have poor digestion, you should really be on some good probiotics for a extended amount of time. Maybe you could add ginger or some other digestive enzymes to help you digest. I think HCI works to help you digest foods as well. Taking aloe internally is really good to soothe the stomach. Also, it’s really important to have fiber in your diet, and if not then take a fiber supplement. All these things will be good for your digestion and elimination. There are papaya enzyme pills, all kinds of different things that help with digestion. Oh yeah, ACV is really acidic on the teeth. I add a lot of lemon to my drinks and that is really acidic, too. I also have damaged the enamel on my teeth that way. A straw works good, or else, like you said, rinse your mouth with water after you drink Apple Cider Vinegar, or lemon."
12,josh777,426,"Post #8 1-1-11 First, let me say that I have added a cinnamon supplement to my anti-fungal vitamins. This last week I have not done so well. It was a holiday week and I neglected doing all the things I had been doing before. I quit taking my garlic cloves or baking soda water, and I even missed my anti-candida vitamins and supplements a few times; taking them once instead of twice a day. Also, I ate some food I shouldn’t have. I have avoided alcohol and sugar for over three weeks now. But I did eat some food with some processed sugar, a few grams, already in it. I’ve had wheat products but I’ve been pretty good avoiding the yeast. I’ve had corn based products, but I’ve avoided corn in it’s original form. I’ve done pretty good with the food, I feel. I’ve been eating more meat than I ever have, but I’ve managed to keep the sugar very low. I have been drinking coffee the past few days, and they say that caffeine causes an insulin dump which is bad, but, oh well, I have had some coffee. My tongue still does have a thin layer of coating, but sometimes it looks a little orange as opposed to white. I wonder if that’s because I’ve been smoking more, though. With no booze I have begun smoking a bit more, and I wonder if that’s it. Regardless, I still have a thin layer over my tongue, but I have noticed when I brush my teeth and tongue more often, and especially use baking soda on my tongue, it goes down and looks pinker. It does irritate me that only for a bright shining instance did my tongue look perfectly healthy and pink. Now it always seem to have at least a thin layer of a mildly orange looking tint. Not super bad to where you would really notice it if I stuck out my tongue, but it is there. My tinea versicolor is beginning to fade. The one thing I have stayed perfect on is taking baths and showers and keeping my skin with a layer of Selsun Blue on it to create inhospitable conditions for the tinea versicolor, and it seems to be working. I was tripping out a bit when it looked like there were some new spots on my right arm. But now it seems like it is all fading back into a normal, consistent skin tone, instead of all these leopard spots all over my shoulders and back. That is a big relief, let me tell you. I have been pretty lax in applying the Desenex anti-fungal powder to my skin. I probably should get back to that. Like I said, I have the new cinnamon supplement which I hope works really well. I got a few new vitamins on sale at the drug store. I picked up some B complex, and E vitamins. I just needed them in general. So overall I’m doing pretty good. My routine and diet lapsed a bit, but I’ve stuck with it. New Years Eve without any booze, boo hoo, but I’m still chugging along. I still plan to buy some more candida supplements, but money is low, and I’m going to wait till I run out of the ones that I’m taking now."

0,dinkydo,428,"Hi everyone I have just registered with this forum and am hoping I can get some help on here and maybe help others along the way also. For as long as I can remember I have been suffering from digestive problems in fact my mother says even as a baby I never “fed well”. I was diagnosed with having Fibromyalgia almost 3 years ago as I had been feeling so unwell with aches and pains, extreme tiredness, headaches, fuzzy head, feeling bloated and have been taking antidepressants since my son was born almost 12 years ago. Prior to that I had been on and off various antidepressants most of my adult life. I have done a lot of research and think perhaps a lot of my problems could be stemming from my digestion problems and think I may have Leaky Gut and/or Candidiasis. I have been Vegetarian for many years and also dont like eggs and avoid diary products so can any suggest or advise me what I actually can eat and what is the best supplement to take that doesnt cost a fortune. A lot of companies have supplement programmes that range in cost from £120 – £180 approx wich claim to clear up Candida problems but I just cannot afford this so any little bit of advice would be much appreciated.

1,yeastfix,428," I really sounds like your symptoms are yeast related.  In terms of your diet, what do you eat? I know that you’re a vegtarian, but how would you discribe your diet? Do you eat fish?  There are plenty of things you can still eat, even though you’re a veggie, in fact… this could make things even easier for you. Let us know what you do eat, and I’ll try to come up with some diet ideas and recipes for you. Look foward to hearing from you. Barbara 🙂"
2,dinkydo,428,"Hi there Barbara. I dont eat fish and only eat minimal dairy products as I am a strict vegetarian. I usually make my own stews with pulses, chickpeas, spices and other vegetables and do eat a lot of fruit. I had to stop eating porridge as I found it was making me feel really bloated and it also gave me stomach ache. I take soya milk if I am having breakfast cereal and have cut back on coffee which I now only have occassionally. I look forward to your diet ideas and recepies. Many thanks Carole"
3,Vegan Candida Diet,428,"Hi there, I see this post is kind of old, but if you are still struggling with this, or if anyone else is looking for advice about being on the candida diet as a vegetarian, you may want to have a look at my blog: vegancandidadiet.blogspot.com I should note that everything I know about this diet comes from the internet and the info packet that came with my cleanse pills. I fall into the “all doctors think my condition is hopeless and don’t really care” category, so I’m approaching this all alone. For this reason I’ve been stricter than some of the diet plans I’ve seen, because a lot of information on websites seems misguided, advising for example that you cut out yeast but still continue eating things like rice, honey, etc. – which as far as I know is completely wrong! I suppose the best way to start is to be as strict as possible, stocking up on all the things you know definitely ARE acceptable. Unfortunately, the diet has been really expensive for me. I’ve splurged quite a lot on nut butters, oils like coconut and hempseed, and of course all these fresh vegetables in the middle of a cold northern winter. Quinoa and amaranth are really great for the vegan candida diet follower, but they can also be expensive. Fortunately pretty much any health food store or yuppie grocery store will have these “grains” (actually seeds as far as I’m aware) in their bulk bins, so buying them that way is a great way to save money. Quinoa especially is the kind of product you’ll see marked up to insane prices in a lot of stores, but you’re just paying for extra and snazzy packaging. I know that it’s easier said than done, but I do advise that if you go on this diet you commit yourself fully and spend more than you’d ideally like to. You’re going to be very hungry, plagued with unbearable cravings, so you really should surround yourself with as much candida-diet-friendly food as possible. Being on this diet will mean not eating out at all, which depending on your current habits should offset some of your spending costs. Just a little tip – I’ve taken to keeping chopped up celery sticks in my fridge at all times, which I dip in hummus or nut butter as a snack. Having this on hand all the time is a great way to deal with my cravings for sugar or snack foods, because it’s one of the few things I eat that doesn’t require lots of advance preparation! Avocados are also great to keep on hand for snacking or for adding to otherwise bland salads. Best of luck!"

2,Can-Did-A,429,"When I used a probiotic in the form of a capsule – one-a-day, high strengh stuff, that survives the acids of the gut, I had the symptoms of candida on my tongue, white spots. When I stopped the dosage altogether, the spots disapeared. I’m not even sure if I have a candida overgrowth to begin with, but supposing I did/do, can anyone explain to me why this happened? Cheers."
3,Tpug,429,"I believe going on this diet, if you have Candida/if you think you Candida/you just have body issues, gives you the ability to asses the foods you are eating and minimize or delete the ones that are causing you problems. The beginning diet will let you know if you have Candida giving you the die-off symptoms etc. Even if you do not experience these symptoms you can still slowly introduce the foods you enjoyed and start on a clean slate to find out what was giving you the issues. As for Can-Did-A and the probiotic; I have only seen and read that a white film on your tongue is a sign. Spots too I guess, I am not sure. I’ve used pill form probiotics for a few years, but I have never seen spots only some film (I am guessing from the Candida issues, which I am dealing with now). An idea is, there is just something in your diet that you stopped eating at the same time you stopped the probiotic. Not sure exactly. -T"
4,Can-Did-A,429,"Thanks Tpug. But nah, it was the probiotics that caused the white film & spots on my tongue, it actually gave me the symptoms of candida. I struggle to find information as to why this happened. Would you or anyone help me find it? It’s really interesting to know. It’s almost as if, by taking the probiotics, it was too much of a good thing for me. Either that, or it was a die-off symptom of killing the candida."
5,4evryoung,429,"I’ve used probiotics for years. Initially to control cystic acne. It worked great, I rarely get those painful zits anymore. It also cured the retitive cyst I used to get either under my arms in the groin area. Even though I’ve always taken Probiotics I still managed to get it in my gut with occasional mild vaginal yeast infections. My tongue has never been white. I’m wondering if your body and the existing bad bacteria was fighting off the good bacteria you were introducing into your system or whether you might have gotten a bad batch. I hve been advised that you should change your probiotic every month so your body doesn’t become resistant to it.

1,BenjiRixon,430,"Hey Christina, Just my opinion but i would get tested for candida first to see what your up against, then once you know you can deal with it accordingly as in – if its a strong colonisation (which sounds like) you’ll need more than just a diet change along with a bag full of anti candida killing products along with pro biotics. i got a test which comprised of a mouth swab and stool sample, sent it off and got results back in 3 weeks and cost about £100 in total which wasnt bad i think compared to my ‘free’ mis-diagnosis from my doctor and now i know ive got a medium colonisation so can tackle it accordingly. there are lots of test kits available but this is the one i got http://www.candidatest.co.uk/"
2,whyitsme,430,"You can also just try the diet for 2 weeks and see if you notice a difference. It doesn’t hurt you by getting rid of all the bad food, and is cheaper than getting tested. I tried the diet on my own for 2 weeks, and felt a significant change to know that was the problem. Of course getting rid of it is a much longer process, which shoudl include fungicides."
0,kelandu,431,"Hi everyone. Im aware that we are all here for answers but if any of you have had any success or feel like you are recovering can you please share the info. I am doing the yeast free, sugar and dairy free diet and I am on week 7. I am still too ill to work due to the exhaustion amongst other things. I really am desperate to get well so I can get on with my life. I have been ill for 10 months although 9 of them months were due to h pylori, although I wonder if i have had candida longer than i thought. the symptoms are the same .  I am waiting to start the candida clear and i have raw garlic in pure virgin olive oil daily , I take bicarb soda in water when i get heartburn. i was using apple cider vinegar but it as rotted my teeth because becaue i didnt think to swill my mouth out with water afterwards.  have any of you had insomnia with this too?  I got some fluconaziole but dant take it because i always read the side effects and they scare me off. Has anyone tried them with success?  I would really appreciate any advice. thanks. and i hope you all get better soon x"
1,Eileen40,431,"I saw great results from the basic diet, without resorting to the extra supplements. My diet consisted of: 2 to 4 cups of homemade vegetable soup daily, (more water than solids). Two 3-oz burgers 6 oz turkey Two big green salads 2 avocados with ground garlic This was divided into 5 or 6 small meals. If I needed more food, I consumed cooked squash or greens, such as spinach. Sometimes, I ate raw tomatoes. Everything I cooked had garlic and/or ginger in it. After several weeks of this, the body rash, the itching, the tiredness, the headaches, the coating on my tongue, the jock itch, and the depression started to go away."

1,TT,432,I did a food allegry test few years ago and it listed the symptoms of Candida. Couldn’t believe how much of it I could relate too. Unfortunately I never gave it a proper go (the healthy diet) this time round I am more determined as I can’t go on feeling this crap all the time. Never forget the first time I realised there was something seriously wrong when I drank my Budweiser. I was practically double over in pain!! Bloody yeast and wheat! Plus the fact the Pill would have contributed to the Candida. Have been off that for over a year so won’t be going back on it. My aunt has Candida and I always remember her being on a strict diet well to me it seemed strict. But when you look at it….it’s not so bad! I had to cut back on chocolate due to sensitive teeth so that isn’t soo bad. My only downfall would be crisps. The overwhelming urge to drink Coke and Red Bull at times makes sense now. It was the evil Candida making me!! Scary how it has control over your body like that. The only problem I face at the moment is money. Due to being a poor student I’m a little bit low on funds. During the summer I shall be able to pay for the good food and the healthy antifungal remedies. I’ve exams coming up and can’t really afford to have diaherra or some of the issues that arises when you first start cleansing. You can’t really leave the exam hall repeatedly!! Ha! What I am going to do is definitely try and stick to the diet. Maybe leave the detox drinks until a few weeks time. Anyway I shall be back to post soon!
2,bluebowspoodle,432,"I’m on the detox phase. Its my 7th day but I was cheating with organic natural peanut butter a couple times. Even while cheating, I felt better than I did since April. I have so much more energy to do things. I’m able to wake up in the mornings, not so irritated by everyone, want to get dressed up like I used to everyday, and I even enjoy cleaning everyday now! This is crazy… a complete 180 for where I started. In May I was diagnosed with Seborrheic Dermatitis and prescribed anti-biotics, and it was all good and well until I stopped taking them. My symptoms got even worse, scared me and I thought I was dying or loosing my mind. You would too: -chills & fever at the same time -numb right shoulder -headaches for hours -hair loss (my biggest concern and what led me to this site) -tingles/ itches all over my body -light headed -“chicken skin” on my arms -tired everyday, all day -avoiding social activities and calls from friends -skipping classes -Finger and toe nails darkened  -Lack of concentration -Spots seems to move when I saw them from the corner of my eye (i guess hallucinations) -nervous/ afraid for no reason when alone -Under stress, my face felt as if it blew up like a balloon and felt red hot This diet has shown me a better way to live and this is a life changing moment.

3,Candida diet,432,"All this time, I was ashamed of having this condition. I suffered from Candidiasis last year. I had been with 2 doctors before I got totally treated. Sometimes when it attacks, I couldn’t sleep well and the next day, I was tired at work. So aside from my doctor’s visit, I also did my own research to help myself because I’m too busy to go to the doctor most of the times. There is one site I can remember because I kept visiting it for reference. It’s http://www.wheatfreecake.net. i hope this helps…"
4,apctech,432,"Hello, everyone! It’s good to be here. A little about myself…I first developed a Candida infection when I was 13 years old and I’ve been battling it ever since. Twenty long years. My main symptoms were fatigue, spaciness, chronic constipation, and persistent gassiness. As a teenager, I was mortified by the flatulence. You can imagine how my classmates treated me. The symptoms of Candidiasis stripped me of most of my self-confidence and my classmates finished off the rest. After a two-year bout of insomnia/depression in my mid-twenties, I decided that I couldn’t live like that anymore. I started scouring the internet for anything that could possibly explain my symptoms and I eventually stumbled onto Candida. Like many of you here, I experimented with the different ‘cures’, but none of them really got rid of the Candida. In fact, when I finally started to cure the constipation with probiotics and a high fiber diet, I was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis, which I believe was directly caused by leaky gut syndrome due to years of Candida overgrowth. I am happy to say that after twenty years of battling Candida, I am finally feeling like a human being again, the gassiness and depression are subsiding, and my self-confidence is gradually returning. There’s light at the end of the tunnel. The combination that works best for me is eating raw coconut (or coconut oil), honey, and cinnamon at least twice a day. I also drink cinnamon water, which is what it sounds like – cinnamon in water. Exercise and Epsom salts help with eliminating the toxins produced by die-off and, of course, probiotics replenish my intestinal flora. I’m looking forward to seeing what things have helped all of you."
0,joe1971,433,"My diet hasn’t always been the best,though I try,I’m still ingesting more carbs than I should. I’m always teased because I usually have dessert or some sort of sweets after meals. Some people I know say they crave salt more than sugar,I wish that was my problem. And I try and cut down where I can,eliminating or substituting foods.  Lately though I’ve had this weird feeling in my intestines,almost like I can feel the candida coming through my system. With symptoms including fatigue, irritability,and even shortness of breath. I take a variety of supplements including candida formulas,chinese mushroom(was told to alternate supps to the system doesn’t become immune),probiotics(also heard that perhaps they can feed candida?) Over the past week or so I’ve been feeling more bloated than usual and today was feeling weaker. I started to panic and start calling holistic doctors(not regular doctors obviously because most don’t know how to address yeast)…but the doctors were either out of my financial range(one of the divas charged $300 just to come in and ‘meet’ them,not including treatment),or they did things which I felt wouldn’t get to the solution. I feel that I need to get directly tested,through stool tests or whatever.  So I ended up trying some caprylic acid and that seemed to improve things slightly. This recent event scared me into shaping up even more with the diet and treatments. I’m glad this site is here for support;"

0,stana,434,"Hello, I just wanted to share my sister’s story. She used to get frequent UTIs for years, she took antibiotics and nothing helped. One year at Christmas, she ate so many cakes, sweets etc. that her candida overgrown so much causing her to faint in the doctors waiting room – that was the end to the sugar and beginning of a sugar free diet. One of her urologist doctors told her to go on a sugar free diet and when I checked this web on what to eat and what not, the diet is identical. Her partner went on the diet with her to support her and 4 months later, her UTIs seem to be much better and finally they can start trying for a baby. I could see how hard it was for them to start as you really have to think about what to eat and what foods to avoid but they managed it and now it seems that I will have to go on this diet as well as I seem to have fungal infection in my toe – nails peeling off my nail bed. We already eat very healthy in our household as my daughter was diagnosed with cancer when she was only 4 years old so Apple cider vinegar, Coconut oil, molasses, colloidal silver are no strangers to our cupboard ;-)))) Good luck to me 😉 I know it will be a challenge to give up on coffee and milk! Good luck to all of you just starting! Stana xxx"
0,TT,435,"Was thinking of keeping an online thing of my struggle to sort this Candida out. Just stocked up on Vitamin C (to help during the time of Candidia Die-Off). Got some Psyllium Husk powder and have started on that. No sign of the Bentonite Clay but I shall try some other health food stores. Bought some Grapefruit Seed Extract as well. All for under €20 so I am happy, wasn’t sure what to expect. Must buy the chunks of ginger next! Don’t think I will be able to stick to the full week of cleansing and fasting. So I am compromising and will drink the detoxing drink and the Liver Flush drink few times during the week while sticking to the diet. I have noticed how I get no real joy out of eating junk food or even my dinners anymore as I’m soo fed up of feeling crap. Yeah it tastes good but I can feel my insides just begging me to cop on! 🙁 Time to go shopping tomorrow and finish off my shopping list, which is as follows: -Extra Virgin Olive Oil -Ginger -Broccoli+Cauliflower -Cucumber -Onions+Peppers -Plain yoghurt (I’ve never tried but am willing to give it proper go!) -Garlic -Pork/Chicken -Eggs I think I read somewhere that you are only suppose to have 3 eggs in the week…but surely that isn’t right? If anyone knows tell me! Like the idea of the omelette every morning but maybe that wouldn’t be good every morning as that would be alot of eggs in the week?"
1,joshuaf,435,"Hi TT, I’m sort of new to the diet. I tried to cheat after about 2 weeks when I noticed symptoms to almost go away……Then it came back even harder! As for eggs, Eggs are great for you when maintaining a low carb diet. They have 7g of protein and I eat several per day in order to maintain a high energy level. Not only that but proteins help suppress hunger longer. The problem is that your body breaks down and uses that energy within 3 to 4 hours. They have a lot of fat but the good kind of fat that promotes healthy digestion. The bad part is they are high in cholesterol. If you have high cholesterol, I suggest eating just egg whites but you’ll have to double up on them if you’re trying to keep your protein intake high. I’m no expert but I workout 5 to 6 times a week and need to have lots of energy. Now that I can’t eat a banana for a carb boost because of this diet, it’s even more important for me to keep a high protein intake. My point is that I’m “all ears” when it comes to protein and study protein dieting regularly. Sooo to answer your question BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE: A couple eggs every morning are great for you! And if you don’t have high cholesterol then don’t cut out the egg yolks. I’ve had no issues with it affecting my Candidiasis."

Did you happen to get any of the side effects of the Candida Die-Off? Thanks for the info on the eggs. I knew there was something about them not being good in some way and it was the cholesterol. I’ve no idea if at my age I can get high cholesterol(I’m 24). I’m starting this diet and will start up my exercise routine (mostly walking and kickboxing) again. I know you can’t eat bananas at the first stage and maybe even the second stage but I think you can try and re-introduce them eventually. Unless of course you notice they have an effect on you which then means you should cut them out. Quite annoying that aot of fruit can’t be used esp grapes and strawberries…I mean come on! They are the best! 🙂 As for the eggs I shall definitely be trying the omelette tomorrow morning. Think maybe on alternating days I can leave out the yolk just to be on safe side. Handy thing is to boil them so the yolk just falls away when you open it. Thanks for replying! To continue on with what I said yesterday….I went shopping! I skipped breakfast this morning(I know, I know bad idea! Will do better tomorrow) Dinner: Venison Broccoli Green Beans Onion Spinach (all veg steamed) Dessert: 1/4 of a cucumber! Seeing as the water below the steamed veg had alot of the nutrients drained into it from the veg I decided to make a soup for later.  In it I’ve added obviously only thing I am allowed on this diet. Soup:  1 red pepper 1 red onion 2 leeks 2 celery 2 cubes of frozen spinach 2 handfuls of chopped up turnip (ready made in bag handy!) 2 cloves of garlic 2 handfuls of shredded cabbage(ready made in bag yet again handy!) Little bit of salt. Haven’t a clue what this will taste like as I’ve never made a soup myself. Also bought some Dr.Oetner-Onken Natural yoghurt as it has all 3 of those good bacteria that is advised by this website to take 1)Lactobacillus acidophius 2)Bifidobacterium longum 3)Streptococcus thermophilus. No added ingredients. Does contain cows milk. The taste is actually ok. Just bit weird for me as I’m soo use to strawberry yoghurt ha! Comes in a big tub though. Says it has to be consumed within 3 days. So think I will just have one tub of this every week as that should do. Correction! Soup is ready….can smell bit too much of the celery though..It’s all about learning ha Have just blended some of it, to make it feel more like a soup and not just chunky veg in water! Tastes nice but suppose you could add in some spices or herbs if you wanted or some salt. Shall go see what herbs I have lying about the house. Dessert after soup will be more of the plain yoghurt. In fact any snacks shall be either this yoghurt or slices of cucumber. Or steamed up a few veggies and nibble on them! Good luck everybody 🙂"

Maybe those symptoms came about because you ate certain types of food again? Do you mind me asking what symptoms they were? If not that’s ok…I’ll soon find out ha! Progress update: I’m after eating more venison there. Craving is still in me though, not for meat or more dinner, but like sugar in the form of anything like fruit/bread/rice cake. Gonna have to put my hand up and admit I did slip up there now and had 2 mouthfuls of milk >.< which I know I shouldn't have but I couldn't resist. Esp since my Mother had left the room. Arrggghhh being tempted by flippin milk ha this is bad/annoying. Have to be careful and not overload on the meat though as that aint healthy either. Living at home while doing this will not be easy. If I was back in my flat I would only have the food necessary for this and nothing else. Just gotta have more willpower. No tempting chugs of milk! Overall not a bad first day. Going to try this Psyllium Husk thing again this evening. Not sure how much to take but I’ll start off small. Signing out, TT 🙂"
5,TT,435,Up until this evening I had been following the diet pretty damn well. Got bad news/annoying news in 3 different areas of my life quite literally one after the other! So I broke out and helped myself to mashed potatos smothered in butter. Think butter is ok in this diet but not the spuds. Then to top things off I have just polished off a feed of plain digestive biscuits with some butter on them. Arrrggghh. Probably set me back by the 3 good days I’ve done. BUT I’m going to look to the positive. Successfully made the omelette in the candida diet recipe section 🙂 Though I didn’t have fresh spinach so used scallions. Well when I say successful it turned out more like scrabbled egg with onion and peppers mixed in….still was very tasty! Plus another positive thing is my water intake has gone through the roof so this is good. Shall put this down to experience and remember that if I get bad news again to not go worrying about it or let it overcome my emotions and body! *shakes fist* Start afresh tomorrow.
6,Ninni,435,Any update TT? Did you manage to stick to the diet?
7,TT,435,"Utter failure I’m afraid 🙁 I started my exams and was stressed out and couldn’t handle the diet at that moment in time. Once I had that can of red bull and I went tumbling back into the old habits. The alcohol from my college ending party/leavingdo/friends birthday really did some damage. Then a friend died and various little things got in the way. So comfort food was needed and ate in large quantites! Going to be away from home now for next few looking after a friends house who thankfully has a dairy intolorence/intolerence(spelling!) so only very healthy things in her cupboards 😀 Going to give this another go for my final week here then once I sette in New York next week I can start it properly again. But at least help it along now and get back n track. The airplane food will probably throw a spanner in the works but messing up on one thing is ok as long as you don’t let it tumble out of control like I did. Felt really good while on the diet(actually healthy and not in discomfort after eating), hungry quite a bit though so I must up my meals with more veg and make sure I get enough. Right now and since I fell off the wagon so to speak I’ve felt like utter crap again. Snapping at the people I care about. Moody as hell. In discomfort/pain. Tired all the symptoms full blown. Soooo not worth it 🙁 BUT hey sh*t happens! Doesn’t mean I’m going to stop trying. Life threw me a few curve balls or whatever you want to call it and I crumbled under the pressure. That’s ok and I’m not going to kick my own arse over it anymore 🙂 One thing I will be doing though is going to doctors and seeing about getting medication for my acne. At the moment it is pretty bad. No doubt to me abusing all the bad foods and Candida can cause acne. But want to have it on standby as don’t want to loose my job because the customers don’t like the look of me! ha God that would be terrible O.o Right. There is some veggies in cupboard and there is a cucumber left in fridge. No yoghurt left unfortunately. Shall have to wait until another day. RIGHT! Get myself some supplies tomorrow even if I have to buy from local supermarket and will be alot dearer than in the big town. Get my arse back on track. Shall update and keep updating as once I stopped posting in here it probably did damage and made me think ahhhh sure why not have a wee slice of bread >.<  Posting is important and will keep me on track."
8,TT,435,Holy crap!! My last post was back in May. >.< Oh dear. Right well I’ve done flippin feic all about the whole issue and have begun having serious problems with my sinus which is a result of the wheat and yeast intake. Started last night with eating just beans and load of water ha! Today went shopping and made myself a nice lunch of: -Kidney Beans -Chickpeas -Scallions -Lettuce -Cucumber -Avocado Throw on a sprinkle of garlic salt to help with the flavour. All washed down with water. Was actually nice! Going to go up and have dinner. Probably throw those ingredients in along with whatver veg my beloved Mother has cooked me. I’m actually wanting to try a vegetarian diet but don’t think I’ll rush all this at once. Try and deal with the very limited Candida diet before I go Veggie on it! Had been for big walk after lunch and went for power nap(I aint old I swear :P) now I am awake again and the cravings are kicking in for anything that aint veg or healthy. So I must get my arse in gear and get my dinner into me pretty sharpish to avoid these cravings and hunger pangs for the bad foods. Will update tomorrow. Gonna stick at it this time. Well try and make it to the week mark. Take each week as it comes!
0,natnmargie,436,"Hi there! I need to share some news. Here is a bit of history: Back in 2004, I discovered I was “hyperthyroid”…and then suspiciously it got better and shortly thereafter I discovered that I had Candida…badly. I fought Candida, did Cleanse after Cleanse and finally had it where I thought it was at least “under control” and I could live with it. Life during all of this time was stressful with 3 close family members dying and stress of buying and selling a new home and moving…which didn’t help my Candida issues. November of 2009, I went for a physical and my thyroid was tested and I was “super Hyperthyroid” with a resting heart beat of 120 beats per minute and absolutely exhausted all of the time. (many other symptoms too) After many tests by my MD, I was sent to an Endocrinologist…he put me on an “Anti-Thyroid Drug (PTU) and ever since then my Candida simply went away. The moral of the story is…your Endocrine system can really “mess you up” (the Thyroid is consider the great Mimicker and Adrenal problems can also look like Candida) and I really want to encourage people to get tested by their Doctor for anything that could be causing the same symptoms we get from Candida. Currently, I am pending surgery, which will “fix” my thyroid problem permanently, and have felt great this entire year…the Candida is like it never existed. I am still careful about what I eat and only have sugar as a “treat”…but I have zero symptoms. So please go to your Doctor and get your Endocrine System tested…you might find out that you have a problem that is “fixable” in many holistic, simple ways, and you could feel so much better. PS. I am by no means suggesting that Candida isn’t it’s own disease, but I was not aware that thyroid/endocrine issues can cause it, and I’ll bet you didn’t know it either. Have a great day…and feel better. Margie"
0,Guest,437,"A few years back I suffered from severe candidasis from being on antibiotics for 8 months. I followed the strict candida diet and it took two years but I finally eradicated it. I now am able to enjoy most foods in small amounts. I still need to stay caffeine, nuts, alcohol, juices, sodas or energy drinks."
1,Cécile,437,It took two years? I thought I read that one month was usually enough. Did you have a very severe case of candidasis? What where your symptoms? How did you finally know that you eradicated it. Did you do tests?
2,Guest,437,"The worst symptoms were the constant fatigue and pain(bloating cramps, gas) whenever I ate. This still happens to a smaller degree after any caffeine, alcohol, nuts, and sugar. I also had sinus problems, acne, thrush, and extremely painful periods. It took me a long time to completely change my diet. Now I now only drink water and have learned to focus mostly on eating veggies, eggs, fish, and organic chicken. I do fine if I have brown rice or brown rice pasta once or twice a week. One or 2 days a month I do a day of just raw vegetables to detox. It was extremely difficult to finally follow the diet strictly ( especially alcohol) but it has made a huge difference and feel well enough to do everything I want to do in life. Everything was a big struggle before. I take a probiotic, Candida Digest by Plantetary Herbals between meals, Essential Enzymes by Source Natural before meals, Sea Kelp, and Oil of Oregano one week on and one week off."
